"I've nearly gotten myself in bad trouble more than once with road rage. There's one technique that has sometimes helped me, so I wanted to share it.

If I catch myself starting to get mad on the road…  (and I know that's the hard part, catching oneself *before* overreacting)... I start doing simple math in my head.  I'll add together the digits of a nearby license plate, or the digits of a speed limit sign, or any random numbers.   I keep adding up different numbers for a few minutes.

It seems to pull me into the more rational, logic-oriented part of the brain and away from pure emotion.  (And it engages the brain more than the fabled “count to ten” approach.)  So it has worked sometimes.   

(The times it doesn't work are when I'm “already too mad to care whether I'm mad” because I didn't catch myself soon enough.  I think a lot of us have been there. Still working on that...but not giving up!)",1
"I had an uncomfortable moment with some people and the situation felt loud. 
I’m not sure if there was a loud exhaust from a vehicle or if I was so angry/frustrated/intense emotions took over my mind.
I’m not going to ask the people that were there, well, because it was not a fun situation for me. Has anyone experienced anything like this?
I’m working on my issues, including avoiding situations and people like that.",1
"Hi all.  I'm a very mellow person who doesn't really have anger problems because I essentially avoid all situations that make me angry.  It's just how I was trained growing up.  There's a problem though.  I have to deal with a divorce and working on the divorce makes me angry.  Thus I have a huge mental block on filing out the forms and stuff which are very complicated.

Try as I might, I have a tough time reframing the whole situation into something that doesn't make me angry.  How do you guys get through this kind of thing if there's something you have to do, but it makes you angry?",1
"I'm done. I can't cope. I'm so angry and I can't cope any more. 

I'm done.",1
"I have been feeling on edge lately and a few days ago I chose to do an activity that I know has a long history of frustrating me when I am in a mood (video games). Well, wouldn't you know it, I lost it and slammed the desk drawer in anger and broke the drawer. This is obviously an issue in and of itself, but the desk belongs to my girlfriend who I live with. Today, she discovered my fuck-up and I profusely apologized, but she has not spoken a word to me. She has never seen this side of me because I have not had an outburst like this since I have been with her, and have genuinely made big strides to control my anger over the last few years. I just don't know how to fix this situation and feel absolutely awful.",1
"Growing up I didn't have much of really any support from my parents, and dealt with a lot of emotional abuse. A lot of gaslighting and being the blame for anything everything that could go wrong. I could never really form a relationship with either of my real parents as for a while I hated them just as much I hated my actual abuser. I wanted to have a family that could have dinner at a table instead of me just running straight to my room and locking the door every night. Every day felt like it was cheating me out of some semblance of normalcy that others around me had. I hated them for having things I didn't. At this point any time I had an arguement with anyone it would be the focal point of my week and every day was a new arguement about anything at home.  This went on for about 15 years until I moved out a few years ago. I'm 26 now and my morning routine is often now wak il ng at 4:30am to take a shower and ponder about how I wish god would just fucking wipe me out of existence already, not just kill me but completely wipe my dna off the grid, so this leads to me hating something that doesn't even really exist. Deep down I just want something to be held accountable for the shitty existence that billions of directionless lifeforms like myself, I wanted my parents to say they're sorry. I wanted god to fix his shitty mistakes and give me my pancreas back. I keep holding answerless grudges that will never be resolved and I honestly have no idea what the fuck I'm even doing. How do you get rid of that? I don't want to live like this. I'm tired and I can't sleep. If you made it this far. I'm actually pretty sorry and I hope you're doing okay on your end too.",1
"I'd been dating this guy and things ended last night. Things had been weird the last week or so and I told him that if he didn't have space for me in his life right now that was fine but I needed him to just say it. He couldn't give me a straight answer. I lost my fucking mind, marbles and manners entirely and said some really nasty things to him. I mean I said things that took my own self by surprise so i can't even imagine how he felt. i feel especially bad because i did this knowing that he was already feeling down. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I apologized and told him that although what he did to me (there's more context) was unacceptable he didn't deserve to be put down like that. I wished him well and told him i hope he enjoys his life. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning im feeling the anger hangover. I feel sad that I still haven't been able to get it under control. I'm once again question whether or not i'm actually a good person or not. I mean good people don't say the things I did. I was drunk and im far worse when im drunk. I know better and i keep making the same mistakes. I'm pissed off at myself because I gave him a reason to feel justified. I just. This has to stop and i don't know how to.",1
 A problem ive been having again recently is dying/losing in a shooting game. I go from complaining about dying to yelling to screaming and finally ill just start breaking shit. Ive started taking a water bottle outside and just throwing in my backyard until it explodes. But that doeant solve the problem. Any ideas or tips on dealing with this anger?,1
So me and my best friend were playing this game I realllyyy like then one day he bought the most boring game alive but unlucky for me he likes i didnt care cause playing with him is better than not playing but then he plays the game i like with his sister and why i ask him why her not him and if he wants to play with her why not all of us he said cause i dont wanna play with you that really annoys me not cause he doesnt wanna play because he owed me a game but suddenly said no and didnt wanna play now hes just being a dick all together like atleast say it in a more caring way like seriously weve been playing that game for years and never ran out of fun and he buys this boring ass game and i play it with him every day and now he suddenly doesnt wanna play with me cause just no reason in the new game its sooooo boring its just one thing over and over (im not saying the name cause i dont wanna cause trouble) like weve been playing since 2nd grade now when he finally plays the game i wanna play he doesnt wanna play meanwhile when i say i dont wanna play hes like WHAT THE FUCK EVERYYYYDAY YOU DO THIS how do i not care cause if i didnt care this wouldnt be a problem in the first place,1
"I'm unable to hide my anger, and I'm always on the wrong because of it. 

I never had a problem with anger growing up until my early 20s. I stated relationship and to this day, love her to death but the relationship isn't perfect. I noticed myself getting more angry at the point where it was now an issue. Its all I could feel and caused more issues. 2 years now ive been working past it and very very slowly but surely its declining gradually. 

So I'm a 25/m working at a chinese restaurant. A new coworker started and seems cool and a good fit. Everyone at my job already knows I can get angry (crappy situation) sometimes but they seem to be a little understanding after being there a year. They know I work on it daily. Any way i forgot his name but the coworker came up to me and called me a girl name instead of my actual name. He was laughing but didn't seem like a joke to get me go laugh with him. It just triggered me and havent been able to shake it off a couple hours now. Any advice? Feels like I'm going back on a lot of progress ive made",1
"Ever since the past year where I started dealing with depression and sucide thoughts I started feeling pent up and very angry. Not at anyone but at myself. Whenever I make a small mistake I feel so angry at myself to the point where I would feel worthless. I dealt with abuse in the past and it broke me mentally. I feel so angry the entire time and feel like one day I will snap and do something I will regret. Recently my anger also extended to other people where I can hold grudges and never forget about what they did to me. When im alone in my room I feel so angry and sad at the same time openly.


If I'm overreacting please let me know because I think I am. Please help me I don't know how long I can last dealing with this.",1
"So exactly a month ago, I saw a post on r/All that directed me to this sub - and what I have learnt has helped with my outbursts of rage.

I would get so angry I have physically destroyed (my own) property on numerous occasions. My turning point was getting involved in a shouting match after road rage on my part - and the guy got so angry he almost came after me. I realized I have issues when the smallest things would drive me to hurling things across the room.

So what I have learnt - and hoping to help someone out as well:

* you have to identify the triggers. How do you feel when you're just about to blow up? Those feelings - when they start coming, practice mindfulness, and self-talk to actualize/realize that you're sliding down that slippery rage/anger slope. Time to stop, count to 3 - and reassess. ***9 times out of 10 this helped me not throw a plate across the room.***
* pin-pointing the real reason you blow up: for me, i would get especially angry when people cut me off while driving,  don't listen to my opinion (or i tell someone something really cool, then days later they tell me about it and I'm there like, ""seriously? you know i'm the one who told you that). When my SO didn't do the dishes after promising he would.

So the 2nd one I'm still struggling with - because I had to face up to my own ugly soul - why do I feel so entitled about stuff that actually doesn't matter? Still need to do a lot more soul searching, but i'm glad to announce that it's been 4 weeks of not breaking anything, not banging anything, general peace.So to all you guys - thanks for sharing the tips and techniques. I'm a work in progress.",1
"I’m usually a calm person, but I always have these moments where I just bark. A few months ago I broke the wall in one of my episodes and my family won’t let me live it down, but every time they make a joke or comment or anything about it, it also makes me so angry and I just snap at them. I can’t keep my volume in check. When I’m angry I don’t care where we are or when or anything I just yell and raise my voice. Anyone know how to keep your volume at a low at least? I hate the stares after I come to my senses",1
"Maybe it’s there and I missed it.

When I’m angry, which is daily (duh), I try to remember that most things I do aren’t necessary, and if I’m in a bad space, it’s better to take a break, a nap if I can, or just kinda stop what I’m doing, or disconnect from thinking.

Essentially, doing nothing is better than doing something if I’m adding a negative value. 

Sure, I could wash the dishes and help out, but if I’m pissed about it, and I take it out on someone then or later, it is usually better if I do nothing, take a break. And then, if my meditation/reflection time is successful, I have a sense of gratitude when I do the dishes (or calling my mom, or whatever). 

We are often told that if we do nothing we are lazy or unproductive or selfish, etc, but doing nothing is often the right choice when anger is present. Again, acts done when angry often lead to a negative on the cosmic balance sheet.",1

"Usually i am a pretty calm guy. Although sometimes stupid stuff happens and i cant control myself, just today i broke my Iphone while playing a stupid game and got so mad about it that a kicked a hole into my bathroom door.(this was half an hour ago)
I really want to know how you guys manage to not go full rage.
Sometimes (like today) i get so angry i cant breath, and fall into the floor crying.
I need some serious advices guys plz.

Thanks in advance",1
"

I lost my dad a few years ago and my company did not send through a sympathy wreath to me. While a colleague came to visit me, she and others did so out of a personal obligation. This I am grateful for but didn’t appreciate that there was nothing sent by the company to me while I witnessed others receiving sympathy flowers for every loss of a loved one. This has bugged me for the past few years and I approached my HR Manager to clarify and gain understanding on the oversight. While I accepted her explanation (sorry, it was an oversight on our part) she did not investigate further as to who didn’t do their part to arrange the flowers. I happen to know who this person is and feel really angry whenever I see her. When her Mother died , I went around the office to get people to sign on a sympathy card for her. Her very presence irks me and I am finding it difficult to face her. It has come to a point where I cannot even look at her face. I tell myself that it is time to let go. However, I am struggling with this anger that I feel. I want for her to be counselled and for her to know that I know that she did not arrange this for my dad’s death and that it was a cruel thing to do (I know that she does not like me). I want to have a closure on this and move forward. Any wise words on how I can cope with this anger a little better?",1
"Recently I’ve accepted that I need to work on my anger. I’ve been doing real well. That is until the co worker who nags all day put his target on me. 

  BItching moaning groaning and down right lying. 

Management has done nothing for the last 20 years but tell him to be quiet until he acts up again. Growing up in an abusive home it’s the cycle of when my mom would cross his lines and dad would “correct” her. 

This lead to my ptsd as well as many other Deamons that I face. The past I have recently forgiven and no longer feel ashamed to talk about

However I can’t make him stop and management won’t stop him. So what else is there to do. It’s not even a thing of ignoring him as co workers tell me it all when I goto work and he leaves. I try to ignore it. But the slander is killing me. To the point of me exploding on management. Last time I complained they found a way to spin it on me so I’d keep quiet and I was punished into submission. 

What do u do about the nags. I ignore at work but it eats at me.",1
"I came to college after a not so great time at high school. Didn't really have any friends cause the only way I knew how interact was being the school clown which didn't really roll as well as it did prior to high school. Anyway, college started out with a lot of stress adjusting to the work and some depressing feelings here and there. Led me into some sad/mad, pissy moods. But, sometime later some friends I knew from middle school came to visit me. Probably, the most genuinely happy I've ever been in life. They didn't stick around too long though as they all had their own lives to attend to.  Now, I'll just occasionally see them here and there while going to places in which we'll just exchange some brief greetings. 

Anyway, a couple days ago I realized that I started to like being angry and a bit sad more than I do being happy. It helps me get work done and avoid people bothering me (in most cases) and I'm starting to try and figure what my triggers are. I couldn't do any physical harm even if I wanted to, I'm too unfit to do so. Funny story, I was actually slower than the guy with asthma while I did track in middle school. But seriously, after going to the gym for the first time only to find out that I could barely last 3 minutes on a cycling machine and having the feeling of people shooting their glances at me, I'm never going to exert more energy than I need. I don't like interacting with people, but I'm still interested in what other people do in life—that is as long as it doesn't involve me. Reason why I'm making this post is cause I remembered reading somewhere that craving anger or ""succumbing to it"" is bad for you or something. Probably won't do anything about it until something bad happens though, but I guess I'm just interested in the topic for now.",1
I’m tired of having this hate in my heart for these people that don’t care about me. I have bad depression and some anxiety. I’m tired of hating them but also get so damn angry I want to act on it. It’s getting harder to not act. I want them to hurt the way I hurt. I know I shouldn’t but I want the pain to go away.,1
"I notice now days, I keep getting angry. It’s not at big things, but it builds up. I try to remove myself from my loved ones (especially my boyfriend as I have no desire to hurt him) but sometimes I do end up hurting those around me. I really really hate it, I feel like I’m a bomb. I don’t know what to do, relaxing things help for a bit and then I’m back to angry. I enjoy being happy (duh). But I’m really afraid now, I don’t want to hurt my loved ones like my boyfriend and best friend more. Any suggestions?",1
"So I've been really angry lately over really small things. It usually happens when there are people around me and one or two of them are whispering or making noise. This especially happens at school or at home, and I get really angry and say/think really mean things that I would never really say or do. I haven't told my parents or my friends yet, but I think I should. When I'm angry I usually yell or hit myself ( I've made a post on this subreddit about it). I've had a few moments where I have yelled at someone really loudly or hit myself really hard that it made a bruise. I don't mean to do it, but i guess it's just the spur of the moment. I get anxiety over people sliding objects but that doesn't really happen anymore, and I've talked to someone about it. This has been happening since I started high school and it might be due to stress, but I don't know. I'm 13/f if that helps.",1

"Hi all! I'm a 33/m who just lost my job a few weeks back. I ve been trying hard to get a job but have been unsuccessful in it. The anger in me has been there for a while maybe a few years but a few days back I lost it completely! Got drunk pretty bad and abused my wife(5 yrs since marriage) with words which should never be said. She always forgave me for my outbursts but this time she broke down completely. The moment I let out that anger I realised what a collosal blunder I ve done. I cried about that but didn't help. She's almost about to divorce but then both our parents intervened and managed to convince her to not go with the divorce. We have a child of 4 years and I feel that's the only thing which is keeping this relationship alive. I really love her but the  anger outbursts destroy everything that was repaired earlier. Now I'm frustrated cos of this situation that I'm in and also cos of the job that I don't have.
What should I do? Pls help me!",1
"Sometimes I get so caught up in a problem, either professional or personal, at work and I just get obsessed with it to the point where I am no longer effective in my work

How can I go about letting go of that anger and frustration at work? It seems nearly impossible to let go of it sometimes, and will even follow me when I get home at times

Any advice?",1
"I have been lurking on this subreddit for over two years in an effort to get better.  I have attempted to work many strategies into my life, but none have worked.  Even after I have made my life multitudes better I still carry around this anger demon.  I feel a bubbling rage inside of me constantly.

I work out 4-5 days a week, I eat well, I sleep well, I'm doing well in school, and yet losing at video games makes me want to put my fist through my screen and jump out the window.  I get so angry I can't see straight, my chest hurts, I get an uncontrollable urge to punch things, and any chance that I can play more is gone.  I have even bitten into my own arm before out of pure anger.  This almost always happens in games like Rocket League where the enemy is being a sore winner alongside beating me.

My friends know how much of a baby I am with games and I feel like it's affecting my relationship with them.  I feel like I have no one to talk to, so maybe this post will do something for me but probably not.

I feel so frustrated that all the things I have seen and tried to corral my anger don't work.  I feel cursed.  Sorry for the rant.",1
"I have a bad habit of being a mocking asshole when someone ignorant and stupid says something to me to put me down or assume something in an extremely rude way and I dont know how to manage it so I dont say the first comeback that pops into my brain.

"I want to know some easy ways to cope with anger since I’ve been getting angry a lot lately and I just don’t want to let it out on the people I care about. What are some things that could help, like games, activities, exercises, etc.?",1
"I get anxious a lot and worry constantly but for a while now I seem to be getting more and more frustrated and angry with little things. This has been leading me to hit walls and hurt myself just to deal with the anger. I feel better after doing that. This can't go on as it's not healthy.

If things aren't going my way or if someone doesn't hear what I say I immediately get angry. It could be from forgetting to buy rice that instantly starts me off. If people are around and I get the feeling like I'm gonna have an outburst I don't deal with that straight away but I would look around at things to hit later when no one's around. 

It's getting to the point where my relationship with family and partner aren't healthy. They are all great but this is putting a huge strain and I feel like I'm pushing them all away. I went to the doctor's but he suggested I start boxing and eat healthier. There's a long waiting list for therapy so that's not happening for a while.

Any tips or advice would greatly appreciate.",1
Hi all. 38m. Recently broke up with a girl after 8 months. She wanted me to move in with her which means moving an hour from where I live. I would have to find a new job and be further from my child which I am willing to do I love her but she was not understanding of the hardship it could create. I started yelling and said a few things I should have. This kind of outburst is infrequent but happens when I get very stressed. I don’t know what to do about the. Anger or if I can even win her back.,1
"I've never once allowed myself to feel angry. My dad was always so angry and I wanted to be nothing like him at the price of repressing any emotion and convincing myself that anything other than happy was unacceptable and I'd cry it out once I was alone. It gets to be so much sometimes though. I can't focus, I get anxious and start to take out the anger on myself. I've never wanted to be an angry person but reality is I am so easy to set off but I would never show anyone that side of me. I would honestly rather die than ever let myself get angry and take that out on others. But I'm also so tired of taking it out on myself. Honestly whenever I'm in a rage the only thing I can think of doing is hurting myself and until I do I feel completely insane. 

How can I learn to handle these emotions? I get them so often and so intensely and honestly they just scare me. I don't want them but I know I'm stuck with it so what can I honestly do to genuinely get over any anger without taking it out on anyone around me or myself?",1
"My anger is actually directed toward another redditor. I won't mention his username in the interest of abiding by the rules but because of him, I'm actually using a backup account. My main account is under a 3-day suspension, because he's reported me but that's only part of the reason I'm so angry.

A year ago, I responded in another user's thread and the person i was replying to wasn't even the OP or the person this post is about nor did it have anything to do with him. Some time later, the user in question replied to ME, saying something which was completely uncalled for, and as such I fired back at him repeatedly. When he ignored me, I've been PM'ing him harassing messages off and on and he would ignore me, but that's not enough to make me stop. I wanted him to pay for making that offensive post that was so uncalled for. I want revenge. I'd like to think my constant tormenting him is payback enough but i don't know how he's handling it.

I would even say in multiple messages, he better hope i never find out who he is in real life, but is that even possible though? Is there a ""healthy"" way I can release this anger and address this appropriately?",1
"Suddenly I get anger attacks that may last maybe half an hour or even hours. It is annoying. I dont like it to happen but I dont precisely like affection coming from my mother. After she does it, im like willing to destroy something, then I feel deppresive.. Happens since my puberty. Ive never been molested when being a kid or something like that, but ill be honest: id rather get that affection from other people (in the way that other people are allowed to do it, certainly). When she shows me her affection, I feel like she feels im still her baby and I hate that because I feel like thats the way she made me grow, and also its like it has had an uncomfortable effect on my personality.",1
"I have been so angry, for so many years, for so many different reasons, and it's finally starting to catch up with me. I find myself completely crippled with anger. I stopped talking to my family almost ten years ago out of anger, and still have not gotten back in touch with them. I find myself unable to enjoy anything, even things that I used to love doing, like watching horror movies and playing retro games. Everything seems so pointless, including going to therapy. I don't want to be on Zoloft or Xanax or some other zombie pill. I snap on my fiance all the time, no idea why she is even still with me (we are both overweight so she probably thinks she'll never find anyone else, which is exactly what I think about myself as well). I work at home, at nights, doing tech support, so I literally sit at my desk all night, sleep all day, wake up, eat, watch YT videos for hours, and then start working again. Never go out on dates or do anything romantic with my fiance, and honestly I'm even starting to have sexual issues because of the anger. I find myself so pissed off and anxious about whatever is bothering me at that moment that I can't even focus my mind enough to have sex with a woman who loves me and wants me, and who I'm attracted to. I'm just so angry all the time, and the generality and unspecified nature of the anger makes it so much more frustrating. I'm also convinced 99% of the time that my fiance, my friend, my roommates, or my coworkers all hate me, and/or are mad at me about something. I always feel like I did something wrong and that I fuck up everything I touch. I once got so mad that I smashed my fist into the wall and broke two of my knuckles; my hand hurts every day now. Inspired by the Angry Video Game Nerd, I went to college years ago to ""be a filmmaker"" (what a joke) and ended up doing jack shit with it, and anytime I even try to think about filming some stuff for YT, I just end up telling myself that I'm a loser who no one would want to watch anyway, and the idea is done before it starts. I have also tried my hand at recording rap music, but again, every time I record something, I hate it, never let anyone else listen to it, and tell myself I should never do this again because its worthless and horrible, and no one cares about some fat nerd putting his feelings into rhyme form. I think about killing myself on a pretty regular basis because the idea of living this way for another 50 years makes me have a fucking existential crisis and a half. I will never do it, though, only because of my fiance. Everything I do in life is to please others, the only thing I do for myself is eat fast food and jerk off before falling asleep.",1
I've been so stressed with my courses this month and I've been stressed day after day. I said some horrible things to both him and my parents. Now I'm having some really dark thoughts... I just want everything to be the way it was before but I'm afraid that it might not be able to be that way again. I've thought about a lot of things and therapy seems to be the most positive solution. Anyone have any advice or help?,1
"Since my first post here nearly 3 weeks ago, when I hit a low and knew I needed to do something, I've been doing a little better. Everyone was so nice and helpful. 

I read that Zoloft helped, and I was already on the lowest dose of that for depression, so I talked to my doctor about increasing it, which I got the go ahead to do. I don't really feel different, but I also haven't had any major outbursts. 

I've been trying to do meditation/yoga/exercise every morning, but I really like to sleep, so I usually shut the alarm off. I went a week straight doing it,  but haven't done it the last two days, and I think I feel a difference. 

How do you keep doing things that you know are good for you but are hard to find the motivation for in the moment?",1
"Anyone been in a relationship with someone who took a course? Did it work? It seems every argument we have escalates for no reason. I gave birth 4 months ago and my baby is at the point where he is super aware of his surroundings, I dont want him seeing us like that. After one particular incident once everything calmed down the next day I asked if he would do anger management and he agreed if it was online. Does anyone have any good recommendations? I used the search but some of the posts were years old. I feel myself falling apart. I have PTSD and depression from a husband that passed away a few years ago which led to a heroin addiction. I've been clean two years now. Now with the added stress of a baby and a tad of postpartum depression I feel I'm at the end of my rope. Please no dump him comments, he doesnt beat me or anything like that and is actually caring when we are not fighting. We have like 1 or 2 big ones a month but it feels like it lasts forever. It's just that he can't just move on from an argument until hours later when everyone is miserable and I'm begging him to stop. Thanks in advance.",1
"My girlfriend of 6 years was out of state visiting a friend. The morning she was meant to come back home, she told me she’s staying there, because she’s afraid of me. My anger has been really out of hand this last month and a half. She lies to me, a lot, and recently it’s been excessive and hurtful. I ended up slapping her during a particularly bad argument. It’s been eating at me since. I feel ugly inside. I’ve never done anything like that before. I never want to do anything close to it again, including shouting and being aggressive. She broke up with me last night, but she said she wants me to be her friend. That’s fine with me. I want to build that trust back with her. I believe she’d be more honest with me if I were less intimidating during tense conversations. I started an anger management course this week. I’ve spent the last month reading every self-help lit I could find. I’m making a daily effort, and I’ve made some progress already, but I know it takes more time. I’m beyond ready to get my anger under control. I hate that it took something this horrible to wake up. I feel terrible, right now. I could really use some encouragement from people with the same struggles. How do I show her that I’m trying, without seeming like I’m manipulating her into coming back? I do want her to come home, but not before she’s ready.

EDIT: Found out last night that she’s actually in a different state than she said she was, staying with her ex-boyfriend. She’s had the trip planned since August, so she’s been cheating since before our fights got really bad. She pinned the blame on me. She abandoned me with all the bills, her pet, and all of her things. I can’t uphold my lease by myself, and I moved my life across the country for her, so she’s effectively ruined my life for the foreseeable future. 
Needless to say, she’s no longer a part of my motivation to get better.",1
"She took my phone away when I was listening to music which is a no go for someone with adhd and anger issues. She told me to take it up to the office and as I walked towards the office window to put my phone through the slot,  I felt a tingle go down my body and I stepped towards her almost taking a swipe at her, I have a psychiatrist/psychologist/whatever you want to call him, but all we do is play board games, I believe it's a waste of my mother's money, but she insists I go, if anyone has advice for dealing with this better could you share it with me.",1
"i (18f) was gone last night on a very short 4 hr shift, and while i was gone, my brother failed to keep an eye on our dogs (notorious troublemakers, so they always need a chaperone when they're out) and one of them spilled water onto my $1200+ laptop. the laptop was plugged in and by the time i got to it, the water had mostly evaporated or leaked into the pc. it was plugged in at the time, so it'll likely never turn back on. it's bricked. even worse is that it was a gift from my best friend who i had to move away from, and i've only had it for about 2 months. it's also the only expensive thing that's ever been truly ""mine"".

i feel like im rightfully pissed off, and it's normal to want to accuse someone, but everyone in my family is teating me like some sort of unhinged maniac. i was crying and yelling, but not swearing, at everyone last night. they all gave me faces and were saying things like ""you need to calm down"" and ""its easily fixed"". then my mom and brother and grandma all started telling me that it was my fault for having a cup of water on my desk. grandma even suggested that i was in the wrong for having water upstairs at all. thats when i totally lost it and started swearing at people. i went in my room and just screamed and screamed and sobbed, and punched the shit out of my legs until i fell asleep. i know i probably got out of hand near the end. but now i just dont know if something IS wrong with me or if im reacting normally.

fuck me dude it really just makes me want to die",1
Just broke my keyboard because a stupid game didnt work. If I push a key it also types other letters or numbers. I also injured my knuckles. I really need to fix my anger problems...,1
"So here I am laying down in my bed on my phone being annoyed and stressed at myself while browsing my phone. I get this image in my head. An urge just to grab a metal bat and completely wreck anything and everything in my bedroom. I actually a slight adrenaline flowing when this random urge happens. I just don't get it. Why would would anyone want to wreck their stuff?

I've always been the calm, quiet, reserved kind of guy. Well, I did have fee roid rage episodes during intense chemo as a teen, but that's beside the point. I personally blame retail as working with the public will drain smash your soul into nothingness. The rest of the blame goes to my self-worth, depression, loneliness, suicidal ideation.

I avoid confrontation. I stay quiet and keep to myself. High stress/pressure where I get trapped just tears me up on the inside because I'm desperately trying not to display any fear or anger. To the point of shaking, trying to breathe, sweating, and just breaking down to the floor. It's why I'm better off alone. It's people who brought me to such a state, and I don't want to feel that ever again.",1
"Growing up, my dad used to have anger issues and I used to be scared of him. I have had issues with anger ever since I was a kid. Could it be in my genes or a learnt behaviour? I also hit my temple against a wall corner whilst running as a kid. I had to get stitches. I am writing this because I wonder if it impacted my prefrontal cortex? For me it's more irritability than anger on most days. I don't like answering too many questions, I hate when people disrespect me and I hate it when people are unfair. I try so hard to keep my cool. I have an awful personality, I can't let lose and take everything seriously. I keep mental notes of how people did me wrong and  many other issues. I wish I was a happy, sweet and goofy woman.",1
"ive heard for years that the worst thing you can do is bottle up your emotions and hold on to anger for extended periods since when you do ""explode"" you'll go way overboard and do something you might regret. the way i came up to deal with this was ""pops"" or burst of permissible anger which mostly consist of yelling and cussing, but no harm to myself, environment or people. i do this so it doesn't build and lets me move past something small by getting all the gas out at once. however, if perception of this paints me as a volotile person, even if i do it in private, does that mean its unhealthy? if anger catches you off guard, i feel like the worst thing you can do is stew on it, but is letting it off in even a controlled outburst still unhealthy?",1
"First time poster using a throwaway for my safety.

Spouse has anger issues and has had for years. I wasn't present for his latest outburst but he raged at one of his closest relatives during a family party. He told me what he recalled of it, and focused on the minor disagreement before the long period of angry behaviour. I called the other person and got their version. There are big holes in spouse's account, and I honestly think he is unable to remember what he says and does when he's in full flow. This has happened before, on a smaller scale but I always thought I was the one with the faulty recollection. I've no reason to doubt the other person's account, and it's been corroborated in part by others.

Has anyone on this sub experienced an anger blackout like this? I need to make sure it's a real thing before I approach him since he doesn't seem to think he's done anything wrong.",1
"I never noticed about this problem until I went to therapy for something completely unrelated.

I actually wonder if this is an issue of anger management, given the fact that I never give myself the opportunity to be angry as I was educated this way.

"Age 4 - parents divorced, caught several times cutting my own hair and throwing tantrums

age 6 - harmfully scratching another girl in my school, like, really hard (she bled) because she tagged me. also caught cutting other girl's hair

age 8 - vandalizing peoples things at school, literally takings shits in peoples yards, eating random plants and trying desperately to convince people i was a vampire

i know this all kind of sounds humorous but i am just realizing that being angry/weird and fucking up is like engrained in me.

age 10-11 - spreading rumours about my friends, swearing in front of teachers (sometimes at them) lying, skipping school, cutting myself (i stopped doing this relatively quick)

age 12-14 - weed, alcohol, got involved with a 27 year old man (when i was 14) who i was excited about at the time, but now i am feeling super violated because of him. stomach pumped one new years eve from drinking too much and constantly putting my friends down. 

age 15 - 16 - peer pressuring my friends to do prescription drugs with me, (one of my friends overdosed and went to the hospital, they are okay, thank goodness)  joined an incredibly toxic relationship where the guy cheated and i was obsessed with knowing exactly who with and i also hit him/ pinched him/ did whatever to inflict pain when i was mad at him.

age 17 - 18  - joined another toxic relationship with a guy who cared so much that he would be upset with me for hanging out with my friends sometimes. i completely gave into him and ended up losing connection with my friends. he also had a kid and his ex gf called me so many things that i began to resent him for being with me and allowing me to move in with him when i would have to deal with his past for as long as we were together. i am not happy to say ive hit him and treated him cruelly as well. he called the cops on me. ive really pushed my boundaries and i am in the process of moving out now to better myself and also let him move on from me.

now - i am realizing that so many of my actions in my previous years were fuelled by anger and also feeling alienated. ( i never had a dad in my life and my mom and i lived on welfare checks because she was unable to work) now i find myself dwelling on small things ( like a short conversation that i got weird vibes from) and thinking everyone hates me because of the various things i had done as a kid (small town, everyone knows)

now i am trying to practise mindfulness. im also slightly anti social as i have no real friends in this new city and im ashamed to be around my old fiends. the only person i hang out with is my boyfriend but i am moving out this month.

does anyone else have an extremely consistent track record of very strange coping mechanisms? i have been angry for as long as i can remember, even slamming my room door when i was a kid and just screaming into a pillow. 

i'm not sure what this stemmed from but i moved around alot as a kid and never had a father figure. that probably contributes and like i dont think i was self aware at all until recently.

weird. :(",1
I got angry and lashed out on my family I feel like nobody cares about me which they don’t because if they did my parents would’ve got me the help that I needed but they didn’t so I feel like I was left alone to deal with this depression by myself and it angers me to know that I’m misunderstood and people don’t even care enough to understand so that’s why I got so angry,1
"I am usually very charming person but there are something that bug me and press a button in me . I Burst out in anger . 

We have one Bathroom on our house and we are 4 persons living in the house including my mom and dad . I like to keep things tidy and clean and I try to keep the bathroom empty, clean and dry as much as possible . I Don't like Towels in the bathroom and I have told everyone to use them and take out of the bathroom . I have told my dad that also but her has a habit of hanging his towel inside at all times . I told him once, twice , dozens of times but still he does it . Today I found out that he put a new hook in especially to hang his towel . I got furious and told him that this is a Shared Bathroom . No one hangs their towels inside , why do you ? It got into a heated argument and my mom got involved and I burst out on her also saying she always takes her husband side over mine . 

I know I am not entirely wrong as towels in the bathroom makes it mouldy and smelly plus all kinds of gems can form . But the way I handle things is horrible . I know I need to change but how matter I try I cannot .

My poor parents have learned to live with my Bullshit attitude and I am seriously thinking what would their life be without me . They would definitely be happier and more free to do whatever they wanted .

The ugly part is that the house in under my name which my dad gifted to me . I feel bad but I just like things clean . I don't know its a disorder or I am bipolar or idk whats wrong with me .

Has anyone got any family member that has severe anger issues ? How do you deal with it ? Is there a way to fix it ?

Thanks",1
"Sorry for the long post. 



For a bit of background, I’m a 37yo married male. I grew up with mostly just my mom as I stopped seeing my dad when I was 14yo. While my mom is a caring person, I learned a lot about yelling and fighting, anger and aggression, and other bad habits from her due to her own mental health issues. I’ve been married to a wonderful woman now for 10 years (14 all in) who has put up with my issues for a long time. I have a nice healthy mix of depression, anxiety, and anger. While I’ve been in and out of therapy over the years, up until the beginning of the summer, I had not been medicated since high school. I am currently in therapy and have a neurontin prescription. I also have a Xanax script, but up until last night, I’ve been hesitant to fill it. 



Back at the beginning of the summer, my wife and I went on a trip to VA Beach. It was a good time, but I had some anxiety issues that blew up on my way home when I started freaking out and blamed my wife, angrily, for my problems. She finally snapped and told me I had to get my shit together (which is true). 



While I am, overall, a relatively calm person, things can set me off, with her mostly, that cause me to go from 0-60 in no time. Yelling, being aggressive (never physically, but still scary), and having blinders on. Last night, however, scared even me. 



The following is from my journal (that I haven’t written in since August) about last night. Part of this is just so I can let it out somewhere, but maybe someone out there can help me sort this out. I can never tell when the anger is going to strike. Overall, I’ve been doing better with controlling it and my anxiety, but obviously, I don’t have it all under control. I don’t have a support group or friends, and right now, I won’t see my therapist until the end of the month, though I’m going to reach out today to try and get in sooner. Names have been removed. Hopefully this isn’t considered a rant. 



My wife just got home today from Miami. I was super excited to see her. She's not feeling well given that she's basically been up for 2 days and her and her friend drove straight from key west to DC to home. We went to bed together around 815pm and she passed out pretty quickly. Then she started snoring. By 11pm, I still couldn't fall asleep and I flipped my shit. She had taken her ambien and was so hard passed out that I couldn't get her up to move around. I lost my shit. I woke her up aggressively and started yelling about not being able to sleep and having to sleep in the other room. That was not the right thing to do at all. She got really upset, which she had every right to do. She asked what I thought my exact plan was. Was I feeling better making her feel worse? I was such an asshole. We talked about this before she left, the sleeping thing with the snoring, and we already discussed getting a futon in her office, and I didn’t even remember that in the moment. I was so wrapped up in being tired, having to get up for work in 6 hours, that I didn’t stop to think. I was running on this asshole autopilot that I just can’t seem to shake. There’s absolutely NOTHING I can do to rectify this situation. I feel like this is, in particular, a bigger fuckup than usual. She did nothing wrong. It’s not her fault she snores, nor is it her fault that I can’t fucking sleep through anything. I guess I should maybe get that Xanax prescription filled - obviously the anger still exists and I haven’t figured out how to address it in the moment. To add to it all, she feels like I did all of it on purpose. Not that I planned it, but once it started, I couldn't shut it off. I think that hurts the most and scares me the most. To me, it's like a surreal flashback of something that happened that doesn't totally feel like it was me.

"I used to be able to laugh jokes off and people dissing me but I get my feelings hurt now and threaten them or get violent, I hate being like this cuz I’m like this with my own friends n I feel like they don’t mean it the way I interpret it. I tend to push them away and regret it.",1
"I had anger issues my entire childhood. So my parents put me in martial arts, and it helped, gave me an outlet. And it worked for a long while. But now I’ve been in college for a few years, and while the knowledge remained, the discipline wore off. As I’ve been in college I’ve only used the skills I’ve worked for 2 times. Each in self defense. But lately, I can’t explain why, but I’ve just been praying for someone to give me a reason. And I don’t know why. I don’t want to hurt anyone. And I wouldn’t hurt anyone for no reason. But it just feels like. I need a reason, or I’m gonna explode",1
"So yesterday, an ex friend and I nearly got into a fight. He did something very uncalled for (busted my lip) and I nearly shoved into the pavement.

I yelled what the fuck and he just kept walking. It took me every inch of my being not to slam my fist into the back of his head for that bull shit. So I texted him how I felt, and boy was it virulent.

I never thought I could drop so many F bombs in a single paragraph. Only time when I stopped cussing at him was when he gave me some half-assed apology. Though his shitty attitude changed when I told him my lip was busted. From there on, I ended the convo because I was about to say some shit I was bound to regret.

Thing is, I’ve never went off on spmeone like that. Sure I may get grumpy or frustrated, but I was never that close to actually hitting someone before. All I remember before I went off was a voice telling me “Don’t let that cunt get away with that unscathed”, and kaboom...

So what are the steps I need to take? I don’t want to lose everything because some fiery temper causes me to do something stupid. I’ve heard meditation helps, but I’m also considering Martial Arts to show me humility. 

I don’t know, I’m genuinely in shock typingg this post",1
"I get extremely pissed off when I play video games occasionally. Mainly if I'm playing and I feel that I'm just sucking or the game is treating me unfairly. I just get this guttural sense of rage and literally want to smash something. Occasionally I do. I've broken quite a few too many things as of late during this... I don't understand where it stems from and I don't know how to stop it. I don't want to stop playing video games though. I also don't know if I need therapy or something, because I feel that I get frustrated way too easily and I have this type of anger in sports as well. I just need help with it",1
"I'm a 28 y.o. male with a good career and recently engaged. I am physically fit and work out often. That all being stated, I'm trying to figure out where my annoyance with everyone comes from. I've always been this way it feels like, but I guess I'm tired of trying to avoid it as an issue.

I was at a public meeting for work recently and noticed that while everyone was mingling with each other and in generally good spirits, for seemingly no good reason at all, I felt annoyed with these people. None of them had done more than say hello to me, but just seeing the smiles on their face was upsetting. ""How stupid is this all?"" and ""I really don't want to be here"" type statements kept crossing my mind. Given I was on the ass end of a 12-hour work day, it doesn't take much from people to get me to this state of mind. Literally just existing around me is enough to trigger my annoyance. I'm tired of being the asshole, but its who I am.

My day-to-day at work consists of being around many high-energy people who, you guessed it, annoy me to high hell. It begins to fester in the morning and by the time I'm ready to leave I cannot stand the people in my office for another second. And they really don't do anything that should warrant my annoyance. As I stated, I have a good career that pays the bills and then some, but is ultimately unfulfilling. I feel like my anger with these people is a large contributor to it feeling unfulfilling. I get in this downward negative spiral of thoughts once the annoyance begins and end up in a place where I'm thinking that this job sucks and I'm killing my time here.

Its getting to the point to where I'm having trouble enjoying anything unless its stimulates me. I can't just sit and be somewhere that most people would at least be neutral in. I feel like a spoiled child who throws tantrums when they aren't where they want to be, but instead of kicking and screaming its deeply negative internal thoughts.

There's more, but I think this generally sums up the anger I'm dealing with. I don't know if I came here to get help or if I just needed to see this typed out in a public forum for my own cathartic reasons.",1

"Like the title says, I am new to this sub and was pretty grateful when I found it. I am a young man in my 20's who is dealing with a lot of built up anger over the years but it's really starting to affect me and my relationship with my gf now, it has been increasingly worse from about 3 years ago when I first noticed how bad things could get with anger. 

A little insight, so my childhood did not have the best impact on me after living with my family for so long. Lots of fighting, screaming, yelling, drugs, abuse, moving out before i was 18, etc. I've always thought that this was just ""normal"" to live like you're mad at everything since everyone I've ever met is like this as far as I can remember. I'm not gonna lie and say it was constant anger 24/7 but there were a lot of memories that involved an unneeded amount of anger, abuse tactics, and screaming. 

Fast forward to when I first got into my relationship that I am in now. (Just to clarify, she's my angel and has stuck by me and been very supportive when I need anything at all) 3 years ago I never got THAT angry or upset when something happened. I remember how she would try to show me how my upbringing with my family was not healthy at all and she encouraged me to be a better person overall. This is where the anger really began, I'm not sure if it was because she wanted me to set up boundaries with my family as they've been nothing but disrespectful to me and her since she met them or if I was really that dead set against changing myself.. Either way, she showed me how this or that reaction is wrong or how my family should respect me enough to not go insane and yell when something doesn't go their way. (They always make it out to be like my gf's the bad guy simply because she doesnt want me to grow up like them, because of this, they always point the finger at her when something is wrong. Ex- ""Everything was fine until you met that little b-word!"" Or ""Don't get mad at me because you want to follow that b-word around and do what she tells you to do!) Basically, I was caught between the whole ""family forever"" stigma and the most caring and considerate girl who just wants me to grow into a better person for the greater good of our futures together. 

I started lashing back, almost resenting her because of the fact that every time I told my gf a story about my childhood she would tell me how this or that was wrong and they/I should have never acted that way in the first place. I was getting to the point that I didn't want to tell stories anymore. It made me furious knowing that she was right, every time she was always right. 

Now, 3 years down the line. I have yet to take action on any of my anger issues, it's getting to the point where it is affecting my mood at work (I'm in sales, on commission only, so if I don't sell then I don't get paid) and most importantly, it's affecting my relationship with her. She has been nothing but phenomenal this entire time, we argue some days but that is mostly because I don't want to be wrong about how I was raised and once again, she is always right about this kind of stuff. Another reason we argue is my attitude is always crap. (Yesterday for example, everything was fine until late that night when I thought about having to return to work today. I got extremely frustrated and just caught a bad attitude, I then proceeded to complain about how work is crap and this is crap for a solid hour or so when in reality I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO WORK YESTERDAY SO THERE WAS NO REASON TO COMPLAIN!) She has encouraged me over and over again to manifest positivity and break the old habits/connections in my brain. I know deep down that I am turning an eye on my childhood and it's not a healthy habit to pick up. I realize that my anger is unacceptable, she has taught me about how your brain can break old habits and form new ones by just manifesting the change. It has worked in some cases but not the ones that are most important to me like this relationship. 

I am not going to drag this out and tell you every detail about how my anger had ruined more days then not with her. I will say that I am finally at a crossroad where I can either grow up and get over my anger or unfortunately lose the best girl that has ever opened my eyes to something new. I know you're reading this and thinking that this guy is just full of excuses but to be fair that's what I think most times when I reflect on these situations so I guess you're not wrong. I feel like my head has been building up anger over and over until it's just a sea of complex issues that I never actually got through. (I have a habit of getting over an issue instead of getting THROUGH it like a normal brain) The only issue with this is that I have pushed it to a point that I am annoyed to deal with MYSELF and MY brain functions. I have read that meditation can be a form of relief but I'm so flustered that I cannot clear my head. It's always, one conversation here, another here, some weird pictures from something I saw that day, and some random song playing in the background for whatever reason.. Either way, I NEED to learn how to manage my brain and my anger, it's LITERALLY going to ruin my relationship if i don't pull my head together and actually commit to being a better person. 

Any advice, tips, tricks, or just some tough love and reasoning is greatly appreciated. It's hard for me to find resources on the web and I unfortunately do not have the funds to enroll myself in some solid therapy programs. Either way, I NEED to be a better person for myself but mostly for my gf's sake. (She doesn't like to say it but I feel like this has all taken a huge toll on who she is as a person and I don't want anything to make her feel worse then I already have)


Thank you all for reading all of this.",1
"I haven't had significant anger problems in my past. I could still go 0 - 100 in less time than necessary when younger l, but being a larger guy I've learned to be self-conscious and contain/suppress my temper.

Currently, I'm in a very stressful situation. I work nights, my downstairs neighbour is unreasonably loud during the day (walks like his feet are made of lead and slams every God forsaken door in his apt. I've spoken to him calmly before. I'm also fasting 20hrs a day and generally don't have patience with people after I try to communicate with them properly.

I work in customer service with a variety of demanding/entitled clients, I'm still fine-tuning myself to the demeanor of some of my colleagues and I'm a hair short of kicking my neighbour's door off the hinges and beating him with it. Bref, I have lots of moments of quick flares lately and my containment capacity is currently think. I've felt the patience threshold thinning over the last few months.

"How do you forgive yourself for being so barbaric towards people you care about?

We all make mistakes in life but something like this takes a toll on our emotional &amp; mental health. I've been struggling with anger issues &amp; everytime when things go wrong, my instincts kick in &amp; I end up seriously beating the poor family member. It makes me depressed",1
"I've always struggled with anger, but it's something I felt I had gotten mostly under control when I got into my late teens and early twenties. After reflecting, I realize those years where I had it ""under control"" really meant I just self medicated with weed and other bad habits for the underlying depression, anxiety, and lack of appropriate coping strategies that I believe the anger stems from.


When I quit smoking weed, tried changing habits, and started seeking actual professional help for my mental health, I found that the anger still returned in certain situations. It doesn't happen as easily as it used to, but it still has the same intensity. Whenever something builds up enough, I hold it in and hold it in and if it doesn't go away then I explode. Unfortunately, my wife is the one who brings it out in me the most because she doesn't let me walk away from upsetting things. I'm not blaming her for this because I know I should learn how to handle those situations better. For example, we get into stupid bickering matches and when it goes on for too long, I just get so angry. I don't hit her, but I say nasty things, slam doors, punch walls, etc.


Last night, I stormed off and punched a door and made a hole. I told my wife and she was really upset. I called her from work today and we talked and I apologized for everything, but she said she's still not sure how to react. She's seen me get angry before, but this is the first time she's seen actual physical damage. I know this isn't healthy, but I've been able to hide things I've broken from people before. Now it's out in the open and someone I love is seeing it first hand. I just feel so embarrassed and that I'm some monster that my own wife now has trouble talking to... I know if I want to keep our relationship healthy then I'll need to learn how to express my anger in a healthier way and not have these stupid outbursts. I'm worried about seeing her when I get off work and seeing the hurt in her eyes and face. I just hope it's something we can recover from and she doesn't feel scared or nervous around me.

I'm sorry for the lengthy, rambling post. I'm just really sad and thought the community here might be able to give some advice on how I can change.",1
"So my girlfriend of a few months has guinea pigs and I truly do love them; however, one of them has started chattering at me (clicking teeth together to express anger or to intimidate). The pig in question isn’t too terribly fond of people, but is still receptive of them. For some reason however, when this one chatters at me I see nothing but red. I feel so ashamed to write this about a fucking guinea pig of all things but it can be pretty bad. I haven’t caused any sort of harm to the guinea pig other than annoying the shit out of it when it chatters at me, causing it to chatter more, causing me to get more angry, and so on. The past few days I’ve had some pretty harsh headaches because I’ve been clenching my teeth so bad in anger. My only concern truly is to attempt to reverse any sort of negative thoughts/feelings the pig has towards me and to be able to control my own anger. It feels like cuteness aggression gone out of control. I’ll typically start petting it, but I’ll get too close to one of his legs or his butt (they don’t like their lower back/butts touched lol) and then he starts chattering. So then I start petting him more aggressively which leads to more chattering or him running to the other side of the cage. Naturally I simply move to the other side of the cage and this whole dance continues. Sometimes I will snatch him up (in an aggressive manner) and hold him in front of me. I don’t really know why maybe I’m just fucking mad and what to try to intimidate him but it just takes over me and I do things. Again, I have never once caused any sort of physical harm to either of the guinea pigs. In fact, the one in question has bitten me twice and both times I tried to comfort him because I obviously scared or angered him so badly that he felt the need to bite me. When he bit me it’s almost like it sobered me up. Once I pick up the pig and let him sit on my lap while I’m at my desk or on my bed he doesn’t seem to be “angry” with me or whatever. Which leads me to believe that he’s particularly territorial and doesn’t want me around him in his cage. Again these things truly are adorable and I hate that I’m this way and I really want to stop for my sake, the pig’s sake, and my girlfriends. I’ve thought about going to therapy for this; however, it seems like a niche thing that might be difficult to counteract with therapy or find a therapist that can actually help me. So I come here to Reddit to see if anyone has any pointers/tips to help me overcome this on my own. 

Thanks",1
"I adore my girlfriend. She has truly helped me see the error of my anger filled ways. My previous GFs were very emotionally manipulative, my father abandoned me, and my mother constantly told me I won’t make friends because I’m too weird. My GF says that she believes those types of “backstories” is what lead me to being short fused. 


But I don’t want an excuse. I want actionable steps to be a better partner.  We barely fight, but when we do, it flies off the handle. Yelling. On both parts. Name calling on my part (her part not as much).  When we’re not fighting, it’s absolutely fine. Sure we bicker here and there, but overall everything is awesome....except for when I get mad during arguments. 



We just finished a 2 week documentary gig together.  Our boss was a nightmare. We both ended up pulling 4 24 hour days with 2 hours of sleep per day because our boss would send editing notes past deadline, then implement impossible deadlines.  Example; “I just sent you the script. edit the entire 28 minute episode of this show in 8 hours. I need an assembly cut.”  My GF and I passed through this awful boss with flying colors. No bickering. No fights. We supported each other so well!! We even commented that it was a true bonding experience through a traumatic and emotionally abusive boss (we both quit after my higher up editing friends informed me that that was not industry standard. Contrary to our boss’s words). 

Fast forward 3 days after wrap. 



We argued. It was quite heated.  She saw a text from my ex that was from before we were dating and it made her insecure. In her insecurity, she yelled at me. I yelled back and got more mad than necessary. Now, don’t think she was going through my phone, no. My ex texted me saying she met one of my favorite comic book artists; the texts before that were from MONTHS ago; before my current GF and I started dating. My GF realizes that she needn’t be mad. But it’s too late. I’m seeing red after her yelling. Anyways, she corners me next to the TV, trying to hug me to make the fight go away. However, when I am seeing red, I don’t like to be touched. I just need to listen to John Denver and I calm down. My GF is aware of this process but still kept trying to bear hug me. I got so mad that I couldn’t control myself...and I punched the TV. I’m so ashamed. Not because the Tv was mine, but because the look on her face made me disgusted with myself. She was scared. Because I punched the TV. 

Once things calmed down, I apologized and she said that it feels like I am trying to intimidate her.  I informed her that since I was a kid, when anger took over, for some reason it would disappear when I punch something. SUPER IMMATURE. I KNOW.  but the thing is, she is 4’11 and I’m 6’1. No shit she’s scared. I’m not going to hurt her, but how could she know that when I hit a TV!? It’s perfectly acceptable for her to be scared and I told her that. To not be ashamed for being scared. 


I have signed up for anger management since that fight. I’m journaling. Reading articles on CBT. But I wanted to ask ya’ll Redditors for some advice as well. What are some actionable things you do when you feel the anger creeping up? What do you do to stifle that feeling? I can feel it coming, but sometimes I just can’t fight it!


Help! I want to be the best boyfriend I can be for my partner. And I want to be the best human I can be for myself and my career. My career requires a lot of problem solving, having lots of people under you, and many many things going wrong. I’ve never had an issue with anger at work; however, you never know. I want to learn and be better.",1
"For context, I’m a 25-year-old female. My mother makes me furious, everything she says or does just gets on my nerves. She has a tendency of bringing out the worst in me. When I’m by myself, I’m calm and relaxed and I like the person I am. The moment she steps into the room my heart pounds and I turn into this completely different person: agitated, whiny and with a short fuse. She’s not a bad person at all, even though she does get overly critical and dismissive at times. So why am I reacting this way? What can I do?",1
"I have had anger issues in the past but am glad to say after a lot of meditation and self help reads I am able to hold myself together. My sister on the other hand has not been has woke or fortunate as I have been in my journey and still raises her voice when frustrated. I try to tell her to control herself but that just makes her more mad.

What can I do to have her have a little more self control? It’s so embarrassing when we are in public and I would disassociate  myself with her completely if it wasn’t just about us. She has a two year old husky with severe anxiety and I’m there for her when it comes to him. Unfortunately this also means I am more likely to have to be present with her anger episodes. 

What can I do to push her towards the right path?",1

"This is an update regarding my recent anger outburst. I’ve booked a therapist and all of that but ever since that day where I basically massacred the family bedroom my anger has been starting to boil. You know those temptations where it makes you want to just destroy something? Such as punching a door, punching a hole through glass etc. 

Well just a few moments ago I had an argument with my father regarding my anger and what happened that day. When I mentioned my mother said that I’m just like him he didn’t take it that well and started to berate me on my actions those days ago. Even though I apologized after coming back home he still berated me for that. It wasn’t until I had to take something to the basement where I saw the punching bag. Thinking that I can just focus my frustrations on that I decided to have a few rounds at it. The next thing I remember is my father storming to the basement and getting all in my face asking if I’d bring the entire house down and that I want to be just like him. He then proceeded to push me which caused me to fall onto a wooden desk that has a pointy end which hurt the back of my head.

As soon as I noticed the blood I just looked at him with shock that he just shoved me and caused blood to come out  I felt and heard something snap. I don’t like being touched aggressively and that includes pushing me especially when blood is involved. I just lost it, all I remember is charging at him and hitting him until luckily my mother noticed the commission and saw me batter him and forced me off of him. Before I could even explain my mother yelled “GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE, LOOK WHAT YOU’VE DONE TO HIM! HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH A THING!?” the last thing I saw before leaving the house was my mother helping my father up who now has a bloody nose and a few scuffs on his face, after that I got out of the house and immediately called my therapist saying to move the appointment to tomorrow. 

Obviously I’m not welcome back to my home for now since I basically lost it on my father for pushing me and causing me to bleed for just letting my frustrations out on the punching bag. Due to me being above 18 years of age I’m worried that my parents will press charges on me since I gave him a bloody nose. But this is the 2nd instance where I had an angry moment within one week.

It’s all my fault, well mostly my fathers and myself since I basically took influence from him when it comes to getting the anger out either by punching a wall and all of that and myself watching those “Psycho Dad” videos made by that Mcjuggernuggets guy which gave me more bad ideas on getting my anger out. What else should I do? How can I get through this? How do I come back to my parents and apologize for beating up my very own father? What do I do if they decide to press charges on me for what I just did? So many questions are running through my head. I didn’t even mean all of this to happen! I fee so regretful right now. I let my emotions get to me, I snapped at my very own flesh and blood... 

I feel like you guys are the only people that understands what I’m going through since we all have some form of anger issues. I really need your advice on what to do next. I’m afraid on what to face after what happened...",1
"For the last 4-5 years i've been on top of my anger issues, i take beta blockers to stop me getting worked up, i've not gotten into any physical fights in that same time frame but today i got a snotty text from my director at work and it just made me want to literally bite somebody.


Basically i run a kitchen in a restaurant, i recently implemented a very strict uniform and cleaning regime so we don't have to worry about health and safety, or pest control etc. 


One of my staff who's worked for the company for at least a year longer than me decided to go over my head, for at least the 4th time, to my director and make up something that i'm a hypocrite for not being willing to do the work i'm expecting people to do, even though i spent the last 3 months drilling into people the importance of time management and cleaning, whilst being patient and listening to these people. Now because of his complaints i've lost my right to write my rotas, i've lost holidays, i'm having my job role in the company questioned and lost my right to profit sharing. Right now i want to go to his house and slice him apart in his sleep, whilst he and my director post heart emojis on each other's posts on the work facebook group. 



On the flip side, the rotas which i laboriously slaved over to get everybody their allocated days off is now ruined, people are getting in touch with me to try and fix it, but it's impossible because its out of my hands, and its only adding to my frustration towards this guy.



The last time i felt this sort of rage and animosity, i put a guy in hospital. but tomorrow i need to go in and be civil, even though i think if i don't explode at him, i'll probably knock his teeth out.



How would any of you deal with this, sorry if it's a bit incoherent, ive been drinking to try and calm down.",1
"I have anger issues, that's a given now. However, it tends to be with loved ones. There's been a few times where they've gotten the better of me. I might have squeezed an ex's wrist too hard, or just screamed and banged a table in rage in audible distance of a family member. Today I loomed over my sister glaring at her in rage because of something she said, and her husband told me I had to calm down. I didn't think it was aggressive at the time, but now I see it was. I struggle to forgive myself for these actions because I'm scared they'll happen again, and I need to find a way to control them. I'm terrified one day I'll strike someone close to me in a rage.",1
"NVC = Non-Violent Communication

I have been seeking help for answers to explain why I wake up each morning with a burning rage in my chest. I haven't been able to remember a dream or nightmare in the past three years thanks to my nightly Marijuana regimen. I limit my interactions with society and feel comfortable in my daily routine of work/life balance. However, I still suffer from uncontrollable rage at the slightest provocation. I saught the help of mental health professionals throughout my young adult life but I never found a good fit. The medication I would receive made me feel like a zombie and I eventually stopped taking it but I soon began to realize my anger was taking over my daily life. A simple drive to the store had the potential to turn into a traffic light brawl due to my road rage and lack of patience. A simple conversational debate had the potential to turn into threats and/or actions of violence. It is exhausting to live with so much anger in my heart and I just want to find happiness and peace so that I can become a productive member of society. 

My quest for peace and happiness led me to the local library and I started browsing the psychology section with books about anger and how to communicate with the world around me in a less confrontational way. I read a very interesting book about non-violent communication and it focused on ways to step out of the 'who's right, who's wrong?' conflict paradigm, and instead, to realize that people are always acting in a way to attempt to get their needs met. No one is wrong; it's just a matter of finding strategies to meet each other's needs.

The expression of anger by hitting, blaming, hurting others--whether physically or emotionally--are all superficial expressions of what is going on within us when we are angry. The first step to fully expressing anger in NVC is to separate the other person from any responsibility for our anger. We rid ourselves of thoughts such as, ""He (or she or they) made me angry when they did that."" Such thinking leads us to express our anger superficially by blaming or punishing the other person. The behaviors of others may be a stimulus for our feelings, but not the cause. It is important to establish a clear separation between stimulus and cause.

Whenever we are angry, we are finding fault--we are judging or blaming the other person for being wrong and deserving punishment. Even if we are not initially conscious of it, the cause of anger is located in our own thinking. Anger is a result of life-alienating,  violence-provoking thinking that is diconnected from needs. It indicates that we chose to judge somebody rather than focus on which of our needs are not getting met. At the core of all anger is a need that is not being fulfilled. Thus anger can be valuable if we use it as an alarm clock to wake us up--to realize we have a need that isn't being met and that we are thinking in a way that makes it unlikely to be met. 

To fully express anger requires full consciousness of our need. In addition, energy is required to get the need met. Anger, however, disrupts our energy by redirecting it toward punishing people rather than meeting our needs. Instead of engaging in ""righteous indignation,"" we need to connect empathetically with our own needs or those of others. Consciously replace the phrase ""I am angry because they..."" with ""I am angry because I am needing..."" All violence is the result of people tricking themselves into believing that their pain derives from other people and that consequently those people deserve to be punished. 

Why would people want to tell the truth, knowing they will be judged or punished for doing so? The more people hear blame and judment, the more defensive and aggressive they become and the less they will care about our needs in the future. The more we empathize with what leads people to behave in the ways that are not meeting our needs, the more likely it is that they will be able to reciprocate afterwards. 

If you made it to the end, thanks for reading :-)

TL;DR: I learned of ways to communicate my anger in a non-violent way and wanted to share! The four steps to expressing anger are (1) stop and breathe, (2) identify your judgmental thoughts, (3) connect with our needs, and (4) express our feelings and unmet needs.",1
"Hi! I am new to this subreddit. I came here mostly because I have dealt with this emotion all of my life and it is seriously affecting my quality of life and my relationships with the people I mostly care about. I have had a lot of things happen to me for which I have been to therapy for, however, I feel like the worst side effect of my trauma is anger. I get mad about very little things, I have a really short temper, and arguing is nearly impossible for me. I take things personally and cannot separate logically. It is very hard for me to argue because I get mad really easy and I burst by saying things I really don’t mean. I don’t have patience, it is hard for me to argue coherently, and it is very hard for me to express my feelings in a logical and healthy way. I say what I feel and it seems like I don’t even have a filter, I try my best but it really has not worked, it has improved a little but it is still hard, and if there is a ver upsetting situation I just burst into anger and say the worst things possible. I often get anxiety attacks once I reach like this and I know I have hurt my loved ones. I have been to therapy for everything except this, I feel like my therapists want to threat things from my past and I really need to work on this because it is affecting my present in the worst way possible. Any tips, any books to read? I feel like there is no solution... I feel really hopeless, this has affected my life in serious ways, it is hard for me to make friends, I always look at the bad in people, I feel like I am crazy. Appreciate your thoughts and help.",1
So sometimes when I go to the bathroom or to take a shower I’ll look at myself in the mirror to like fix my hair or check how my skin is etc.  however usually it always ends up turning into a deep conversation with myself or what seems like myself in the mirror about murder and just rage. I’ve taken note of it and have decided to take away anything in my bathroom where I can see my reflection. Idk if anyone else has had anything like this or if it’s just me but if any else has please tell me what you experience if it’s the same or different or if you’ve been through this and have found ways to stop it before it starts or to move on from it.,1
"I have this problem where insignificant talk angers me. I could never sustain a relationship because a pointless text message like ""good morning"" from a partner really hits the anger nerve. I'm on good terms with my parents but whenever one of them calls to randomly chat, I just sit in silence listening and answer back with 1-3 worded sentence. Friends who send memes or talk incessantly gets the silent treatment. I have a few friends who keep the bantering to a minimum and only message me when it's important, I like these people a lot.

I've never expressed the anger outwardly to anyone. I'm fairly sure if something doesn't add to my world experience, the inner rage build. Would you deem this as the cause or is there something more deeply rooted?",1
"I go in the anxiety and depression subs and have been diagnosed with dysthymia (just always depressed) and social anxiety and general anxiety as well as ocpd (I kind of doubt) but for some reason this sub makes me feel the most understood. Maybe my counselor and I are treating the wrong problems.

Also... I've been having bad nightmares. Stuff I would clearly never do but I'm wondering why it's happening. I've been having dreams of telling family members off and fighting them (nice version). All I can think is I have some serious trauma issues I need to resolve and it's keeping me from getting along with people.

I often feel like I'm ready to fight or go off on someone if one person says something to me at work. When I'm angry I snap. I lose track of what's going on around me. I can't focus because all I want is to fight. 

I've been told try not to ruminate but as you can see rumination is now in my dreams as well. 

Some stuff that kind of helps... Breaking shit. Listening to rock music and head banging. Punching bags/ boxing. Running (which I can't do much rn 7 months pregnant). And cussing. That's about it.",1
"Do folk honestly not realize that telling someone to calm down achieves the opposite? It's so infantilizing and makes it hard for me to feel like what I'm going through is valid. Yes, I do have anger issues which makes it harder for me to not want to smash someone's face in.

How do you react when told to calm down? What's a good response?",1
I feel like I’m drowning in my anger but can not pin point the exact place it comes from. I have a great job a loving fiancée and a family that loves me but I can’t shake the feeling of complete rage in my chest. I have gotten to the point of secluding myself from everyone and have even taken a night shift position at work as to not interact with people. I am afraid of getting to close and letting anyone in because I know I will destroy everything.,1
"I think my anxiety leads to worse anger but I am very angry a lot. Most of it's internal but I have strong urges to lash out at people. I'm never physical but I have exploded on people verbally. Usually random strangers if they look at me a certain way or cut me off or just do anything I perceive as rude. I usually keep it all inside but a few times in my life I've lashed out. I have a very negative view of people and I feel like they all hate me. I'm constantly in an angry, defensive mood. 
But when I hold it all in, it ruins my day. I get angry at everything even myself. It's hard for me to let go of this anger.
I don't know how to stop this. I get mad when people stand too close to me, and especially when they start smoking without asking if it's okay. People just dont care and are so inconsiderate. Sometimes I feel it's me, sometimes I feel the world is just so rude. I don't know. 
How do I let go of anger easier? It's so hard for me and it keeps me wound up all day.
I'm 26 and female if that matters.",1
"Not sure if this is the right space for this. Sorry mods. 

Often times I hear from family members that they've never seen anyone so bad like me when I get mad. I feel like I black out into another person that is simply careless and wants to watch the world burn. As much as I try to be a better version of myself day after day, it appears that people simply don't appreciate or don't give a shit. They will still be selfish and not care about anything.

If I may confess, when I let this other version of myself out I feel great for the next hour or so, then later I realize that it wasn't the best reaction.",1

Now after2 months, he has agreed to give this another shot and i’ve promised to work on my anger issues. I looked it up and the way i react is called - Hostile Venting. I react this way in anger because my parents have always fought like this in the house. They attack and say really mean things to each other and then make up the next moment and act like everything is normal. But i realise i have to unlearn this and be a better person to my boyfriend.

"The title pretty much sums it up. For most of my life I've been an angry person but I've always had to keep it inside of me to an unhealthy extent and I believe it has affected me negatively. I recently had a very serious mental breakdown due to a situation I won't go much into depth about. It caused me to mentally break and start throwing myself on the ground screaming bloody murder bashing my head against the floor. Nothing has EVER happened to me like that. The circumstances in which that occured were pretty extreme but it's not like I have don't have an outlet where I release my anger. Typically playing videogames is how I cope but it has become unhealthy so I'm pulling back. My boyfriend is at the brunt of my anger because I feel incredibly comfortable around him and can actually be myself. I don't ever direct my anger twoards him but I can get frustrated with how he handles my outbursts which, through many talks, we have come to a mutual understanding of each other's feelings. We both had grown up in fairly bad households but he developed a different type of reaction to anger than I did. It's a trigger for him while for me it's one of the only ways of communication I experienced growing up. I feel like I adopted the behavior as it was really the only thing I saw growing up. I can get pretty upset and irrational sometimes. Overall, my recent breakdown has lead me to come and ask for help. I really would like some advice on how to not be so angry/how to cope with anger better. I really don't enjoy being labeled as an ""angry person"" even though I really suppress it around others. I also don't want to subject my boyfriend to my anger as not only does it affect him negatively, but it just isn't okay. Any advice or resources will help. Thank you in advance",1
"I'm 14 years old, so this could easily just be a puberty thing, but how do I stop being so damn angry all the time?

I'm just so hot-headed all the time. I'm like a stick on dynamite with an extremely short fuse. Every time my mother speaks, I roll my eyes and get frustrated and just want to leave the room. This has, of course, strained our relationship a lot. Even more than it already was.

Whenever I'm playing a game, I sometimes get so angry that I push my mouse against the wall, slap myself, or slam my desk. Sometimes I can control it, but most times I just get too angry. I've been trying to avoid multiplayer games, but singleplayer games can get to me, too. I have some stress balls next to me, but I just go into tunnel vision and don't even see them. (Nor do stress balls really work anyway, they're often just way too easy to squeeze and don't put up much resistance.)

Everytime I think about me and my past mistakes, even just the tiniest dumb shit that an average 8 year old kid would do, I punch walls, or I scratch myself. Anytime I do or say something wrong, I take it out on myself. I swear all the time, without even realizing it. I just want to not be so angry all the time and actually be able to control my emotions. 

Are there any steps I can take to at least point me in the right direction?",1
"Every single time my mother drives she drives up to 60 miles per hour in a few seconds. On every single road by the way. And then let's it get back to 40, then speeds back to 60. Then slow to 40.

When I ask her to stop or drive olnormally because it makes me sick she tells me she's ""not doing anything"" or ""it's not a big deal stop being such a baby"" and I just want to bash her head into the steering wheel.",1
"I've had some significant changes in my life, but my anger has grown over the years too. I've recently (within the past year) developed episodes of rage, of anger attacks, of explosive episodes...I think you get the idea.


But I don't know what truly triggers these events, but when I get angry or frustrated it turns into pure *rage*. Not being pissed off or slightly miffed but pure, explosive rage. I've been depressed for years, and my childhood wasn't purely filled with abuse but I was physically punished from time to time. Growing up my parents were often frustrated and angry. Does anyone else think that what you grow up with seeps its way into your subconscious and you can't help it? Is it just me?



I used to not feel, but nowadays all I feel is either tired or tired *and* angry. A lot of it is with my job. A lot of it has to do with my situation in life. And I wonder if I'll ever graduate out of this mindset that I cannot control; it's a horrible reaction to anything. Even suppressing it when I need to causes more issues.




And yes, I'm in therapy too.",1
"I moved into a house this school year (I'm a sophomore in college).

I punched the 1st hole in my wall when I was drunk after coming back from the bars. I got assaulted by the bouncers and kicked out for literally no reason (I was literally just standing at the bar trying to get a drink) except that the bartender tried to steal from me as I was buying a drink. I got home and thought I had the money in my wallet. I took out my wallet and didn't see the money, raged for a sec and punched the hole, then found the money in my other pocket and felt stupid. The hole is just 1 punch, so its pretty small.

2nd hole I punched 2 days ago after my best friend called me and told me he was in the hospital because he tried to kill himself. also just 1 punch so a small hole.

3rd hole was yesterday. I was talking to my mom on the phone about my friend who tried to kill himself. Her advice to me was ""maybe you should just distance yourself from him because of his problems"" and I thought she was trying to tell me that I should ditch my best friend since I was 14 just because he is struggling. I got super pissed, yelled at my mom, swore at her, hung up the phone and punched my wall like 10 times, creating a massive hole, probably 2 feet tall and 1 foot across. (I called her back afterwards and she wasn't trying to get me to ditch him, she was just worried about it affecting me and my success. She wants me to be there for him, she just wanted me to distance myself emotionally from the situation so I can focus on school and such still while also being supportive)

So my question is when I get angry like that, what can I do besides punch holes in my wall? My mom said I should punch a pillow or something but imo that isn't as good as a wall. I need to break something, but not my walls.

Also if anyone has any other advice with coping with/helping support my friend and his issues please lmk, this is a very hard time for me.",1
"Hi, I wonder if anyone can relate to this. 

Recently, I've been having these really intense, violent fantasies about hurting people who I feel have wronged me. I find myself thinking about what I'd like to do to these  people and worryingly, these thoughts can stick in my head for hours. 

I had a hard time in school and I was also taken advantage of when I was younger and I've never been able to let that go. I want to find those people and hurt them. Now I feel people are doing the same and I don't want them to get away with it. 

I try to set boundaries and present a confident image but clearly that's not working. I'm not confident and I guess people can see that. It's so frustrating. 
I'm getting therapy and support although I don't share these revenge fantasies with anyone. I worry about how I will be judged. 

Am I losing the plot? Is this in anyway normal or do I need a proper head doctor? I know I'm gonna be judged now but I don't care, I need to vent! I need to get this anger out, I just don't know how.   Hopefully, I'm not alone on this...",1
"It all happened that quickly, all I remember was having this huge argument with my family and at the very end, I remember storming out to the family bedroom, kicking open the door pretty sure I messed up the door pins due to my fury. I even saw red on the walls not even kidding. I then proceeded to punch a hole through the window shattering it to little pieces, kicking the TV and massacred the entire room in my anger. To sum things up, tables were flipped, the drawer pulled down was windows were shattered, glass everywhere and the television having a dent from my kick.  I didn't know I could cause so much destruction. All I can recall was that room in a total mess and the rest of the family in utter shock while I stormed out of the house. 

I'm currently at a friend's house typing this whole thing up cause I do not want to see the look on my parent's faces when I come back. Some of you may think ""Oh, I made this up"" or ""Oh, I couldn't do that."" But believe me, once the adrenaline kicks in you do not know how capable your body is able to do. Combine that with hot filled anger.

Where did I get this anger? To sum things up I got this all from my father. As a kid, I would be with him 24/7 and the first time I saw him punch a door down out of anger or made a dent out of the wall planted those seeds in me. Bad ways to let the anger out. I'm usually a calm and chill person but today just set me off due to how bad of a day I had prior to the argument. Growing up, I would watch this video series made by this Youtuber. His Dad would destroy his son's prized possessions with a chainsaw, hammering an award, shattering his car window with a video game console and punching a TV. This fuelled and further made my ways of expressing my anger grow out of hand. This is the first time I ever have gotten to this state of rage.  I'm even shaking after thinking about what just happened those hours ago. I have told my friend about what had happened today and he suggested I seek immediate help such as a therapist. Yes, I know they cost a lot of money but what other means should I seek in order to deal with this? Not only my family was scared on how I reacted today but overall I'm scared of myself, unknowingly having this monster buried deep inside me filled with pent up anger all because of ideas from my father who has a hard time dealing with temperament and having to watch a stupid video series about a psychotic father destroying stuff. My mother even told me I'm becoming just like my father, full of anger when I let it out. Maybe I spent to much time with him? Who knows. But either way, I need to get this checked out asap. Please leave some advice down below. I really need it.

"Hey, new to this sub. I have had anger issues since I was a kid, though I haven't gotten violent or anything and keep it all internal. Lately life is pretty good, I'm living with my SO and his mom who is very chill and we all get along pretty great.

His mom has two chihuahuas, a mom and her dogter, both grown. They came from an abused household and both show signs of it, but I have no issue being patient and Mommy and I bonded for the most part. Puppy, however, acts like I am the one who abused her and I haven't so much as raised my voice at her. I researched some dog language things and am working on things like not making eye contact, or sudden movements, etc. But when I offer them both treats, Mommy eats hers happily and Puppy slinks away with her tail between her legs like I've just yelled at her. She was abused, she needs patience and consistency, logically I understand that.

Here's what I don't get. When Puppy slinks away when offered a treat, or she wants to sit on the couch and notices me there then runs away again, I get this irrational anger boiling up inside me and I want to kick her dumb little self across the room. I would never raise a finger to her and don't want to break the little trust I have, but my heart starts racing and I have to figure out how to vent that anger elsewhere. Why does seeing a small dog cower, sometimes to the point of peeing if I move too quickly, make me so angry and violent inside?",1
"I'm a male, 25 years old. And I can confidently say that I have anger problems.

A few days ago, I went to the grocery store sometime around 6:00am, so this way the store wouldn't be as crowded, and I could get my shopping done in an easy manner.

After getting the groceries, I went out into the parking lot, put my groceries in the backseat, got into my car, and was about to leave. I got distracted by something on my phone while browsing through Twitter. Something that made me feel angry. I'd rather not say what it was. But put it this way...I was just sitting there in my car, staring down at my phone, seething with rage.

But then, out of nowhere, some homeless drug addict guy spotted me sitting in my car. Keep in mind, the area I was in is actually known for having quite a few homeless drug addicts wandering around in the store parking lot. So I'm not just saying that out of spite. This is a fact. This man was more than likely homeless and addicted to drugs. My best guess, probably meth. Usually, I avoid people like this at all costs. Normally, under typical circumstances, I would've avoided eye contact, locked my car doors, and drove away. But I was so mad that I didn't even care. I simply just let him approach my vehicle.

He knocked on the window. Seeing that the car was turned off, I couldn't roll down my window. So I opened my door and asked him what he wanted. He started the conversation off by asking for my name. Without hesitation, I told him my name, which probably wasn't a smart move. He then sort of leaned and opened up my door a bit more. That made me feel really uncomfortable. With a stern look, he then said, ""Why you following me?"" Initially, I didn't know what to say. I responded, ""What are you talking about? Following you??"" He then said, ""Yeah, I noticed you following me around in the store."" I responded, ""I don't know what the hell you're talking about. I didn't even see you in the store. I was just grocery shopping.""

He then continued to accuse me of following him and kept leaning in closer towards my car. I then snapped and said, ""Listen, I don't know who you are or what you want, but you better back the f%ck up!! I'm not playing with you!! Step away from my vehicle!!"" I felt so enraged. My blood was boiling. I felt like I could physically attack him at any moment. At first, I suspected that he was experiencing meth induced paranoia, which is why he thought I was following him. But I didn't even care. I was just mad. I should also mention that I had a baseball bat in the backseat of my car, and I pondered on using it.

This guy then said, ""Whoa, calm down buddy. I'm only joking. You're off the chain dude."" He seemed genuinely freaked out. He then told me some sob story about how he needed money to catch a bus to see his kids. It was probably a complete lie. But I gave him a dollar anyway. And the weird thing is, I never give homeless people money...ever. But I was so mad, that I gave him the money, just so he'd walk away. I'm amazed how aggressive I got so quickly, especially with some homeless drug addict. I didn't even think twice. That guy didn't know how close he was to getting in a violent confrontation.",1
"I used to react a lot. But I have taken much effort and things have become a lot lot better. Still, I get angry when I am provoked. My main problem is my ADHD is creating forgetfulness.I forget a few times when provoked. I am in control 60 % of the time and I actually have learnt to give 0 fucks. But a few days backI got really enraged. A guy claiming to be a health inspector followed me as though I was a criminal. I had a spat at him on the streets. He said some provoking words. All this happened after a prayer at home when I reminded my self to becalm despite all odds. Please help.",1
"because of my anger outbursts in which I just suddenly yell, but not for long periods, only, for example, one word or phrase like ""leave me alone"" cuz I get calm immediately after, my bf broke up with me.
right now, I'm working on getting him back but if I do this anymore he'll leave for good and I can't cope with that.
I really need help on managing my very sudden anger outbursts, tips?

edit: I did talk to him and he explained that the outbursts aren't the (only) problem and that he can get past them easily but ""my self destructive behaviour"" and ""our different visions regarding life"" but I still need to work on them..",1
"I really don’t know how to deal with this anymore guys. Aside from just offing myself, I haven’t really been able to find a healthy coping mechanism. 

Sorry for being so melodramatic, but it’s the fucking truth. I’ve been with my wife 4 years, and we have a two year old, who is at the stage of testing my patience.

I can’t keep getting drunk, or smoking unhealthy amounts of weed, and just eating away my feelings. This shit is start to get unmanageable, and I can tell my wife and daughter are starting to notice it. 

I haven’t hurt them, nor will I ever. It’s me I’m worried about hurting. Not in like the obvious KMS way, but trying to self-medicate (former meth abuser) or picking a fight I won’t get up from. 

Counting doesn’t fucking work so PLEASE don’t tell me to count to ten. Shit has never and will never work. 


TL:DR; I’m angry as fuck, my wife and kid noticed, and I’ve got no fucking clue what to do with it/about it.",1
"I haven’t physically hurt anyone in the past couple years, but it’s like I see myself yelling at people or sending aggressive texts, and I’m thinking about all the reason I shouldn’t do this. Giving myself examples of when I’ve regretted it. But I don’t stop. I just keep yelling.

Sometimes it isn’t as bad and I’m just agitated, but that’s just how I always am. I hate that I’m this person, that I snap so easily, but I can’t get out of it.

I use anger as a coping mechanism for pretty much all negative emotions, but every so often I substitute it for humor.

I try to guilt myself into stopping but it doesn’t work. It works when I’m getting myself to live, why not this? I hate how I act when I’m angry. I hate how I don’t feel like I’m in control of my body, how this has caused me a fear of becoming abusive in a relationship.

I haven’t even had a relationship and I’m scared of an abusive one. I hate this.",1
"My husband came from a very angry household. His parents would argue for hours on end and call each other names and cuss at each other. His dad was and still is an angry person he's very defensive and tends to go from 0 to 100 very quick. 
Because of this my husband acts very angry and does not know how to cope with how angry he gets. He hasn't been able to cope with how stressful and upsetting his childhood was. 

When we were first together he wasn't angry at all but over time with getting married taking on extra responsibilities and having a baby I've noticed his anger has gotten significantly worse. 
I stay home with our baby so all financial responsibility is on him now so I've noticed that has increased hostility as well. 

My husband talks about how he wishes he knew how to cope with what he has gone through and how to handle his anger and be a better father but he has no clue and I do not how to help. I enrolled us in marriage counseling to get a professional point of view to figure out how he can cope and how I can help him in a loving way. 

I would like some perspective from people who deal with anger issues. Does anyone have advice on how to help someone with anger issues and trauma?",1
"Title says it all. I am overall a very calm and relaxed person and very laid back. I pretty much get along with everybody and most people would be shocked to even think I have a temper lol but when I play video games its like I'm a whole new person and the devil himself has taken over me. I have this very violent temper mainly when I play FPS games or if I perform poorly in any game really. I blurt out the worst possible things that you could imagine, I've broken multiple items such as controllers, headsets, keyboards, lamps you name it. I am completely aware that this is unacceptable behavior and very childish and I've tried to control it for quite some time now and every time I eventually just snap at something and go right off the handle. I am able to play single player games without any problem really and if I do get mad its not even close to how I get when I play multiplayer or FPS games. After awhile it gets very boring only playing single player games &amp; a good chunk of my friends play all the typical FPS and multiplayer games, I work a full time job and only get 1 day off a week so most of my social life with my IRL friends have been through online games the last couple years as we all have different schedules or live in different cities now. I want to be able to play multiplayer games without raging out but I'm almost feeling like it would be best to just give them up for good as it would just be overall better for myself and others in my household. Also has anyone else gone through something like this or similar? How did you deal with it? I feel like I should seek professional help but it is also very embarrassing so I thought I'd get some opinions on good ol Reddit first lol.",1
"Hi Everyone. I've kind of been on a journey the last few years trying to get my anger under control. The problem I have when I get mad at someone who has been rude or abusive is that it stays in a nonstop loop in my head. I don't want it there, at all. It's like my brain identifies that person who was not-so-nice as a threat and starts trying to find ways to settle the score. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel that this is a practical way to live and oddly enough, it's like if I distract myself for hours playing a video game, the minute my mind is taken off of it, ""Your regularly scheduled programming will resume."" It comes back and it starts consuming me and so on. It's like it's some sort of survival instinct that I can't shut off.  


I want to know how to deal with this brand of particular anger. I do not want to be this way at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up in a particularly hostile household and was not treated so nicely by my entire family and I was bullied a lot for being ""weird,"" as a kid. I think that maybe the root cause of my problems, where I reached a point in my life where I'm overreacting to people being jerks and so on and I'm unable to shrug it off as most people would. I want to be like most people so I can be a nicer person myself though because I feel like I'm turning into the kind of person who made me miserable and I don't want to hurt anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone can provide me with guidance, I would appreciate it.",1
"Anger is the only mental health problem that you are talked down to like a silly child when you seek help. See the first paragraph of “help” the NHS offers…


&gt;	""You can control your anger, and you have a responsibility to do so,"" says clinical psychologist Isabel Clarke, a specialist in anger management.

There’s a lot of information informing you of how to be safe from angry people dotted within the article, just to make you feel like more of a monster. I get that this information needs to be out there, but surely not in an article designed to be helping those struggling with their own anger.

I genuinely feel alone. Unlike depression or anxiety, you’re told to “sort it out” by people who are supposed to be there to support you.",1
"I work as a barista in an airport due to having zero qualifications. Although I am focusing on becoming financially independent, for now I am forced to live this version of reality in which I am currently stationed.

I am an existential man; in a constant limbo of disassociation and lack of reason; all accumulated into a force of anger within. And many a violent thought come crossing through my mind, ones that, if acted upon, would have me put in prison for years. For example, today, I thought, ""What if I just decided to react further to a customer that may be slightly pushing the line of respectful conduct.... What if I were to brutally murder him right in the cafe? How the rush would feel. How god-like I would feel.""

It's a contradictory thing to say, from the above, that I have always had a compassion for the earth, and a sympathy for the struggles we humans face day to day. But sometimes, a lot of times, I become vengeful, and I want to destroy the world for what it has done to me. I want to explode with this anger. I want to let it all go....",1

"I’m ashamed.

I’ve been terrible. I swore at my girlfriend, whispered like a psycho that she would burn in hell right in her face while she screamed after she told me to jump of a bridge.

We get in a crazy cycle. I know I’m not the only one at fault but as the man I know I need to lead. There’s no room for me to lose my temper anymore.

A week earlier I wanted to strangle her, I hadn’t slept because she keeps making noise and this night she started an argument that I wouldn’t hold her because it was so hot in the room. I got on her and shouted, I pressed her throat not enough to hurt her but to scare her. 

I completely lost control and there’s no excuse. We’ve just been on holiday for 12 days after the police came. Overall I managed to maintain control except one serious spell where she told me she would’ve reply to a guy who asked her out. I threw a bass guitar on the floor, called her names and walked off.

I’ve been using a method of visualisation to let go of my need to argue back, to call names, to make her wrong. She’s definitely aggressive herself and provokes me so I use this visualisation to let go of my anger, resentment and desire to prove myself right through anger.

I imagine in depth all the things I could do and I let myself desire them more and more, then I imagine that I just can’t to do those things which intensifies my anger, then I let everything disappear in my imagination as if nothing at all exists, not the situation, not the things I could do, nobody, nothing in the world of form and I be with that empty space totally. It’s been helping a lot, but I still have a long way to go. I’m so ashamed of all my angry outbursts. I don’t paint a fair picture here, lots led up to this but I need to take the responsibility and bulletproof myself from these outbursts.",1
"Hello I am 19 (M) and I want to talk about my anger related to gaming.
This has been reoccuring throughout my life since I was a kid. I do have ADHD, I didn't go to therapy for anger issues much and I've been off medication since 2012. You'll have to believe me when I say in real life I am a reasonably calm and collected person but when it comes to games I am a hot head and only one death can tick me off. It's only games where I see my anger as irrational. Most of the time when I get angry is when I die ESPECIALLY when I don't get even a second to react, I die instantly and that makes everything ten times worse. If I can't defend myself I lose my cool. I don't care about losing the game so much because I know the matches don't really matter. But when I die once or twice I get in a really bad mood. I play aggressively in games as well so its not like I'm scared of my K/D going negative, that doesn't matter to me either. What matters to me is the team and the objective and nothing else. If anyone has any questions or feedback in the comments let me know because I want to solve my issue.",1

"Hello,

New to this sub. Yesterday I told my bf I want anger management. I already go to counseling for anxiety and depression, but I think anger might be causing my work problems and problems getting along with others.

Bf says I just need to learn to be assertive and not hold in anger when people piss me off. Thing is I don't know how to confront anyone and I don't like doing it. 

Example, I am a pharmacy tech. And yesterday at work a coworker yelled at all of us (her co-workers) and bossed us around. She then proceeded to talk about me (being the new employee) and blame things on me behind my back. Then the pharmacist called me stupid under her breath and she was very snappy about everything. Both women are old and set in their ways. The coworker is just a bitch in general she's bossy and talks rude to customers and co-workers but the other co-workers seem to just laugh and let her boss them. When they try to do that to me I usually try to defend myself, but it just leads to an argument. I end up hating my job and wanting to just leave. I hate the job itself but dickhead co-workers make it even worse. 


I seem to run into this problem alot and I have yet to figure out to solve it. I simply do not know how to deal with difficult people without getting worked up. I almost made mistakes at work because I was so stuck in my angry thoughts that I wasn't aware of what was going on around me. So far none of the distraction techniques really work for this. I get so upset that I can't calm my mind down to focus on my job. 

I told my bf I want to leave my job, but I'm tired of always having to leave or feeling I have to leave because of other people. I know I'm not happy being around people that piss me off though. It's beyond just ignore it like most people who work say because my internal anger affects my ability to concentrate. 

I do have to mention I'm in my third trimester pregnancy, I have had two car accidents and a slip and fall, I barely walk well rn. And I feel I'm being taken advantage of at work and doing everything myself so not happy at job in general, but this is how work has always been and people have always treated me in life. Very shitty. 

How do I fix this and stop leaving jobs because of dickheads?",1
"I know holding grudges is a waste of time and energy but it feels difficult to let go of them. Deep down, some part of me is too stubborn to forgive. I will keep this short. I'm not angry 24/7 but these grudges come and go. These grudges are based on things that people did and said to me. I have tried journaling (which works temporarily) and shifting my focus to something else. But a few hours later, these thoughts come back. I don't think I have depression ort bipolar disorder. But it gets in the way of my happiness a lot. I am a very kind person but when someione does something or says something I don't like, I find it hard to let go of it.

Does anyone else struggle with this issue?",1
I feel embarrassed at how out of control angry I get. I don’t know how to calm down and think reasonably when I’m in the midst of a meltdown. The only thing that makes me chill out is smoking weed but I also feel embarrassed afterwards when I look back at how intense I felt. Sometimes Im so angry I don’t even want to smoke because I know it’s what I need to have a better perspective but I dread the guilt and shame afterwords. Idk why I have to use cannabis before my brain can start thinking more calmly but it’s like I don’t have much of a conscious until I do l..which sounds horrible and makes me feel like a huge piece of shit. I hate being such a naturally negative thinker.  idk if this classified as a rant and I’m sorry if it does.,1

"I grew up with a violent-tempered mother who left me with a lot of trauma. Part of what she left me with is an instinct to rage. I learned to control it at an early age but I have always felt it simmering under my skin. I have many violent thoughts when triggered. It typically gets triggered by politics, particularly things related to my own trauma (I've had a lot of treatment for PTSD and made lots of progress generally.) It comes out in my ultraviolent fiction writing. But I've almost always treated people decently even when absolutely furious, so I had a bit of reassurance, ""Well, I won't be like her."" 

Now I am 36 years old, 15 weeks pregnant with my first child and I feel like I'm coming undone. I've been sick and stressed out for most of the pregnancy. I've been having a lot of behavioral issues with my cats and consulted a Cat Behaviorist last week so we are starting to implement changes, but my patience with the aggressive cat is wearing thin. He hisses and gets combative when he doesn't get his way and I'm a little afraid of him. I've been yelling. A lot more than usual. I tried to fix it by putting him in a different room when I'm eating at the table, but this morning when he crawled into the back of the closet, well out of my reach, and I had to go to work, I just fucking lost it. I screamed at him and banged things around until he ran out.

This is not acceptable behavior to me. I'm not sure what to do. I need to get a handle on this before the baby comes. Since this happened I've just been reliving my childhood and terrified of the person I am becoming. I would rather die than put my kid through what I went through. It's hard with my trauma to know whether or not I'm overreacting or whether things really are as bad as they feel.

Oh. I should probably mention I recently resumed a relationship with my mother after three years of no relationship because she wants to get to know her grandchild. I just found out she's coming to visit from out of state in three weeks. I should be happy or relieved or something but I feel completely numb about it. Could these be related? 

Thanks for listening.",1
"Traditionally, expressing emotions at the workplace has been viewed negatively. Emotions are thought of as hampering your ability to work well. In fact, most employees believe that negative emotions like anger must be suppressed at work.

This is because expressing your anger can lead to undesirable consequences such as conflicts with colleagues and/or supervisors. You might be viewed negatively by others and may find it difficult to adapt to the work environment. It might also interfere with your performance, as anger can diminish your ability to focus on your tasks.

So, anger is bad for the workplace, right? Interestingly, the answer is not a straightforward ‘no’.  Research has shown that both positive and negative emotions at work are appropriate as long as they are expressed with a sense of professionalism. Similarly, some studies have found that emotions at the workplace may actually be beneficial for both the individual and the organisation. The key is in expressing anger in a healthy and productive manner.

In fact, when anger is channelised and refocused appropriately, such that it is directed not at an individual but rather at certain factors or behaviours within the organisation, anger can  help you to express dissatisfaction and directly address the problem. This opens channels for improving problems in the system. For example, feeling angry about getting last-minute work can be a good thing if you channel your anger to talk to your supervisor and come up with solutions to ensure that there is some structure within which you can carry out your tasks. Instead of attacking your supervisor, your anger can be used to target and change a behaviour/process (not being assigned work on time).

Additionally, studies show that when anger is displayed appropriately and healthily, people at work are more likely to view you as competent, insightful and knowledgeable. For example, getting angry with your colleague who has not done their share of work for an upcoming work presentation - and addressing their behaviour with them - can show other people in your team that you have the ability to notice and speak up when something at work is amiss.

The key, then, is to not avoid or deny feelings of anger, but to address them in a manner that is beneficial and productive. It’s important to realise that anger is not an emotion that always leads to negative results. Instead, channeling your anger can help you understand a situation better, and  promote healthy conflict resolution. Anger need not be suppressed - but it must be managed well, especially in the workplace.

Here are a few techniques to help you manage anger at the workplace:

i. Take responsibility for your anger

To be able to manage anger effectively, you first need to acknowledge feelings of anger when they arise. It is important to be aware of both, the situations that make you angry, as well as your typical reactions to such situations. You are also entirely responsible for your actions when you are angry. Maintaining a daily journal can help you identify such triggers and your anger responses.

ii. Take a time-out

Take yourself out of the situation so as to calm down. In order to do so gracefully, you can say, “I’m feeling some anger about this (insert situation). I need a few minutes to calm down. Can we talk after that to resolve this concern?”

iii. Distract yourself

One of the ways to calm down when you’re feeling angry is to distract yourself with a different activity. You can choose to engage in some mindfulness meditation, focussed breathing meditation, exercise, watching a funny video, walking etc. Feel free to do anything to help you regain your composure and perspective. Make sure you come back to the situation when you’re feeling calmer.

iv. Be aware of your triggers

Think about what sets off your anger outbursts at work, as this will help you address the underlying problem effectively and avoid such outbursts in the future. You can try noting down your thoughts when you are feeling angry, and review these thoughts after your anger has subsided. Such an exercise will give you insight regarding the root cause of your anger, and help you address problematic thinking.

v. Reframe your anger thoughts

Be aware of your thoughts and rephrase any absolute thought patterns that you may be engaging in. Examples of absolute thoughts include, “always goes wrong”, “never works out”, etc. If you were to stop and think about this, you would realise that the chances that something is consistently negative or wrong is low; rather there may be some instances where things didn’t pan out as per your expectations. Instead of absolutes you can think along the lines of, “I’m feeling frustrated that things aren’t going according to plan. But, I know I can deal with this situation. Me yelling at everyone won’t solve this problem.”

vi. Be assertive

Anger may cause you to respond to frustrating situations by engaging in blame. However, the best way to deal with anger at the workplace is to user “I feel…” statements to present your own perspective of the situation and needs from the person. For example, “When you made fun of me in front of the team, I felt hurt by your words and actions. I would like you to be more considerate of my feelings.”

vii.  Be empathetic

When people are angry, they tend to become self-centered and only focus on information that justifies their anger. It may be a good idea to move away from that in order to arrive at a solution to the problem. After you have expressed your feelings using ‘I feel..’ statements, spend some time talking to the other person to try and find out why they behaved in a way that upset you. You might realise that the other person wasn’t even aware that they are frustrating you. In stepping back and allowing space for someone else’s point of view, you are opening the door for open and constructive communication to occur.

viii. Use Humour

Anger can be diffused with the help of humour, either in a conversation with someone else or as part of your self-talk. Finding a hint of humour in situations with others reduces the intensity of anger and allows you to gain a more balanced perspective. Moreover, studies have shown that not taking yourself too seriously helps you feel better, less angry, and less stressed.

Although expressing your anger may be beneficial, it is important to be able to express it in an appropriate manner. This will contribute to ensuring that the workplace remains a safe and comfortable place for you and everyone else.

 If you tend to struggle with expressing your anger in an appropriate manner, feel free to get in touch with a mental health professional nearest to you.",1

"Hi everyone,

Me and my friend got into a conversation, and he admitted that he has a deep, dark secret. Although he seems fine on the surface, underneath he’s a very...(angry? Messed up?) individual. He thinks he’s a monster who is going to rape, murder, etc... if he doesn’t keep himself under a very tight control, despite the fact that he hates rapists and pedophiles so much that he said he’d happily kill them. He also finds it very hard to deal with disrespect, to the point where he gets tempted to just ruin that person’s life. Apparently, he’s been this way since he was around 6 years old.

However, because of what he has to deal with, he’s attempted to kill himself many times from the guilt and fear that he’ll do something horrible. Therefore, I don’t feel like he’s a bad person, but he seriously needs a lot of help. I reckon it’s a disorder of some kind, though I don’t know what. Maybe to do with anger, but I don’t know. He’s going to see a psychiatrist about it. As his friend, what should I do? I fear that if I turn to any other subreddits, they’ll judge me for being associated with him. Thanks for any advice.",1
I've recently noticed that I'm slowly slipping away from the person I once was. I'm always talking shit or starting arguments with people because they have differing views from me. I hate the way I am right now and really want to change but don't know how. I can't find out the reason or the source for why I'm such an asshole now.,1
"This week I have been doing pretty well with my temper. I found music that works well for when I am driving (Spanish guitar, especially Ottmar Liebert), and I used the advice given to me by /u/wampacat , /u/napjerks , /u/GrowinginGratitude , and /u/pricklycitrus  to help. The deep breathing, putting things in perspective, and identifying what I'm feeling have been tremendous for me.

So this morning I was a bit sluggish waking up, but got out the door at a decent time. A couple of blocks from my house I realized I forgot my bluetooth headset. Very much a first-world problem, but my perfectionism and beating myself up over mistakes kicked in and I think it stayed in the back of my mind. I told myself ""It's no big deal, I have other options and I don't really need them"", and drove to work without incident.

At work, I have a 21-year-old co-worker who I do like but she seems very unhappy and usually responds with sarcastic criticism to anything people say. Part of it is the negativity that bothers me, and part of it is ""But for the grace of god, there go I"". I have a tendency to be that way and am really working to not do it because I know it makes people uncomfortable. I stepped behind her chair that she was sitting in at her desk to talk to someone on the other side of the wall from her, and she snapped at me. ""WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE JUST COME INTO MY SPACE TO TALK TO PEOPLE? I don't mean to freak out on you and this is the first time you have done this, it's usually her (points to the empty desk of another co-worker)"" and rants for a few minutes. I apologized and said I understood, and I would respect her personal space going forward. Then my victim mentality kicked in... ""But... she stood right behind me leaning on the back of my chair just yesterday when our manager was talking to us!"" I realized it was not productive to hang on to that thought and it is not bothering me any more.  What i have trouble with is having people raise their voice to me, as it triggers bad memories from the past. My anxiety shoots up and my ""this is unfair"" circuitry lights up, and my response choices to vent the buildup are reduced to crying and feeling like my life has always been shit, or attacking the person who I feel attacked me and giving it back to them 10 times worse to make sure they never forget the resulting wrath of crossing me. (Said humorously, as I know that the ""wrath"" and vindictive response are completely unhealthy)

Some other co-workers ordered Thai food, and I asked ""Did anyone get Pad Thai?"" I pronounce it like I've heard Thai people do so, kind of like ""Pod Thai"", however as I've often seen us Americans do, one of my more obnoxious attention-craving co-workers said ""Pod Thai or Pad Thai?"", pronouncing ""Pad"" in the American way, like ""note pad"". For some reason being corrected with the wrong thing just set me off, maybe because I was already on edge from earlier, and I sarcastically started saying in a very over-done Southern accent, ""Yeah ah wont sum PAD TAH with sum BUSCH LAHT"". Another co-worker said something about ""You're not feeling right"" and I said ""No, you're saying it wrong. Fucking ridiculous."" She started to say something about being southern but I just put my headphones on and turned on some music to drown it out.

In typing all this out, it has helped me vent the bad feelings, plus I am getting a more objective third-party view of my actions. I am acting very immaturely and unprofessionally at work. Just because others want to act like idiots doesn't give me a pass to sink to their level.

Thanks for reading my rants yet again. This is a wonderful forum and has really helped me a lot. I feel more awareness, acceptance and accountability, and thus more progress in having healthy responses to things and not holding on to resentments.",1
"my anger has started to swell up again, but i feel this time around I'm not afraid to act out in my anger.",1
"I still have plenty of time to submit it. I just want to get it done early. I can’t seem to concentrate right now because of my anger.  I tried meditating for 20 minutes, and it helped during the meditation, but once it was over the anger came back.  Is there something I can do to be able to concentrate and write the paper?",1
It's like the emotional pain and hurt I'm experiencing is too much to work through so it gets immediately channeled into a spiral of rage. I need to work on my emotions if I want to fix my anger.,1
"I'm starting to understand and realize that I may have a fairly bad anger management issue.  At least more then I thought I did.

Earlier today I was out getting coffee with my girlfriend before she had to go to work.  My boss called me and asked me if I wanted to come in for some extra hours (today is my day off) because I had to call out ealier this week.  I told him I wasn't able to.  My girlfriend scolded me for not going into work to make up some money.  Thinking back on it she wasn't exactly mean about it.  More like a mother scolding their child.  Instead of being calm and realizing I made a mistake.  I completely lost it.  I started yelling and swearing at her and saying all sorts of very hurtful stuff about her health.  She very rightfully got angry at me and started to give it right back to me.  I don't blame her for this, any sane person would probably do the same.  
This goes on for about 15 minutes.  While this was going on I text my boss back saying I could come in I would just be a little late because I needed to get changed.  He tells me its okay and I didn't need to come in because he realized I wasn't trained to cover what he needed covered.  I **immediately** calmed down.  I stopped swearing, yelling, being hurtful.  You would think nothing was wrong with how I was talking.  Unfortunately it doesn't work that way for the recieving end.  My girlfriend is royally pissed off at me and is threating to tell all of my friends and coworkers how I really am as a person.  Can't say I blame her.  I kind of deserve it.

Heres's my problem.  When I get angry it isn't minor.  It tends to be extremely bad and abusive.  I don't have minor reactions to anger.  I don't know how to prevent this or calm down before I say something really bad (which happens more then I want to admit).  Any thoughts on how I can try to prevent the extremes?  Any thing you do to calm down quickly? I am starting to cause major problems I don't want that.",1
"First time post here, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, since whenever I feel bad I would just go to r/Depression, but I'm not depressed right now, just absolutely angry, ashamed because I've been humiliated.

So a bit of a story, I followed a forum for an independent game where updates would regularly come. But for the past months since earlier this year, no updates came due to the creator getting sick &amp; burnout, and said they'll be taking a  month or two break. Usually in that forum when the game is no longer updated the game will be tagged abandoned.

So months later and still no news from the creator, I fear that the game might be abandoned. Usually in this kind of forums the most annoying comments are the ones that always ask ""when is the new update coming out?""

But I didn't ask that, I just said that I'm worried that the game might be abandoned. But then another user facepalmed at my comment, and prepared a wall of text calling the likes of me an idiot, and even posts gifs because memes gets you likes, and he got a ton of likes.

And that's where my anger comes in. Being humiliated by the guy is one thing, but the fact that other people supported him/her and perceives me as THE idiot, it pissed me off.

But then I replied to that person telling him to chill out, but before I post, I exploded because of shame and pretty much wrote some meltdown towards that person. But thankfully I have some sense of control and decided to discard that meltdown comment because if I did it, it would further prove that I'm THE idiot.

Honestly, I'm still mad right now, but I really want that guy to receive his comeuppance for humiliating me. Which is stupid, because this is the internet, and internet shames you everyday. But man, how I wish I could do the same to him right now.

Or maybe I just made it for experiencing the ugly side of internet. Heh. Sorry for the long rant.",1
"So, like all of you I get angry.  I spend time thinking about things that get me angry.   I try not to, but I think my brain secretly likes to be angry, as its often an easy way out, or a source for a potential dopamine hit.  
I've had a little dying cat in my life, seems he has been sick for about a month; just quit eating, got weak.   I thought he would pull through, but he didn't.  I ended up putting him to sleep.  
When I think back to all the time I wasted being angry, as opposed to thinking about him, it seems like such a tragedy. 
Its too late now, for from now on, I'm going to give that time to those I love and lost.   
I've been working with this, and it really seems to help short circuit the pattern quickly.  Instead of trying to reconcile what it is that i am angry about, my mind is instead overwhelmed with the memories of my loved ones.  Its difficult to be angry in that state of mind.  
Good luck",1
"My mom and I don't get on well. Ever. She just jumped down my throat about something again, and I can feel myself about to lose it. She does this way too often. My face feels hot, and I can tell it's reddened a bit. My heart is pounding like crazy and I can feel this tingling in my hands and feet again.
This is what I felt years ago when I broke someone's hand before I could stop myself. I'm terrified that something like that could happen again, so I'm trying to stay away from her. Being this angry about anything is causing me physical pain, though.",1
"So I need some help dealing with people being disrespectful. It has a huge effect on my ability to hold a job. I either blow a gasket on somebody or some prick at the company discovered this is a trigger for me and uses it to get under my skin. 

I don’t tolerate being disrespected very well. I go into a rage and want nothing else but to beat the shit out of the person who has disrespected me. I’ve never actually become violent, I fear the consequences too much. I do however obsess over the disrespect and try to think of any way I can get back at the person without getting myself in trouble. I go to any lengths to make the person uncomfortable or upset. 

I’m sure this has to do with my father constantly criticizing and ridiculing me as a child. I was essentially bullied for 18+ years by the one person in life that I wanted to like me the most. Shit still pisses me off and now that I’m a grown man he refuses to even acknowledge that any of it happened. 

Anyhow, so how do I deal with this? Just earlier I was getting food on my off day from a restaurant I work at and I look over and I can see someone looking at me, talking about me to another co worker then they both have a giggle and look right at me while I’m standing there waiting for my food. I want to snap on this guy, I want to bury my fist in his face and teach him to never treat someone that way. Who does he think he is? 

I’m sure this scenario must sound familiar to some of you. How can I over come this? I hate dealing with the consequences of thinking this way but at the same time, I can’t let go of wanting to hold these people accountable for being such pieces of shit.",1
"Everyday this is what I here from my parents you have a bad additude, your a liar, your a spoiled little brat, i cannot believe i raised you like this, your a fucking asshole.

It is getting out of hand i do not know what to do.",1
I have been dealing with a lot of aggression when feeling angry. I accepted this as a problem a year ago and now my outbursts have gotten out of control. Physical towards my partner pushing  and shoving  and rude words. I am fearing losing my family. There are times when I can control it and times when I lose complete control. I love my wife and kids and I won’t hate to lose those that I love. I have taken hypnotherapy and regular therapy for the past year and I have yet to be able to control my aggression when feeling angry. In desperate need of some help.,1
"I’ve struggled with depression and anger for a long time. I’ve also been told that I’m a bully.

I constantly yell at my loved ones about everything. I get extremely mad at small things and blow things way out of proportion. For example, I just spent one hour screaming at my mom on the top of my lungs about how she needs to eat better, exercise, clean her room, and stand up against my asshole dad. A couple days ago, I yelled at my sister about how her she is extremely financially irresponsible and she will probably beg my parents for money in the future. In both cases, I know I was overstepping my role and acting like the parent, but I felt it needed to be said. Usually, I’m giving ok advice, but my delivery/tone/language are extremely hurtful. 

This self destructive behavior has seriously strained my relationships. I am no longer on speaking terms with my brother, and my sister keeps her distance but still communicates with me. I know my parents would be much happier if I just moved out. 

Has anyone else experienced extreme anger with their depression? Has anyone else been called a bully or bossy or overbearing? I need some advice about how to go about fixing this behavior and being more kind to others.",1
"This may be a long one, but if you’re struggling with anger, I urge you to stick around. I’ve learned a few things while struggling with anger and I’d like to pass them on. 

I had learned something after a lot of traumatic things happened all at once during my senior year of high school. My sister-in-law used to say (in reference to her own son) that she does not want her son to “grow up blaming the world”. When all of those bad things happened junior year, I thought about what she had said. Even if people have hurt you, you can’t blame the entire world for a few individuals. You can only do yourself a favor and take care of yourself. 

I have been angry. I have been mean. Sometimes my anger feels justified because someone had done something to me first. I used to feel like I was being a punk if I just let things slide. No one wants to feel like a doormat. There’s definitely be those who will incite your anger too. I use to surround myself with those people for a very long time because I never had to think twice about my actions. Why would I? My friends had encouraged me. Those people are angry themselves and will use your intense reaction to satisfy their own anger. Those who tell you to calm down aren’t the bad ones. They aren’t trying to belittle your emotions. They are trying to get through to you and they can’t when you’re upset. 

When you’re angry about something, the first thing you should do is ask yourself what you’re actually angry about. You should try to understand if that negative mood came from something earlier and just snowballed. It only takes one thing to ruin a day and we don’t realize it, so it just festers until we’re snapping at everyone around us. Most of the time it’s really just misplaced anger. It doesn’t always work, but I’ve found addressing what caused my anger and kind of coaching myself helps resolve the feeling.

Sometimes you can’t always stop the anger before that breaking point. You’re only human and as long as you actively work on improving yourself (not just saying you are), then you’re allowed to sometimes fail. It does not mean you’re a failure. No process can be perfected overnight. It’s at this critical point when your emotions are about to peak that you have a choice. You can take a deep breath and let yourself move forward. You’re 100% allowed to think about what has upset you (just don’t act on it), because suppressing anger is even worse than lashing out. For all those videos that go viral, we see people going with the latter. And it isn’t resolving anything. Their anger affects others and incites further incidents. 

I admit I still have bad outbursts, but I haven’t actually yelled at anyone for about 2 years. I’m patient with myself and my progress because I deserve happiness outside of the anger. Someone may still insult me, sure. That’s when my first instinct is to lash back. “An eye for an eye.” It doesn’t accomplish anything. It doesn’t make me feel better or you. It may give us the briefest feeling of power, but we’ll go right back to feeling small. Anger has an illusion of strength, but it just facilitates insecurities. 

Again, I won’t pretend I’m a saint with all the answers. I’m not perfect, but I’m better than I was by making small changes in how I react to anger. Honestly, giving into anger won’t make us feel better. It’ll give us migraines. It’ll give us ulcers. It will make people not want to be around us. I understand the anger. I don’t know if anyone’s ever said that to you, but I promise you when I say that I *feel* the anger too. 

My advice? Retrain your brain when it comes to first response. Every time you feel that anger bubble up in the back of your throat, notice how tense your body has become. Relax it. Take a deep breath and think about how insignificant whatever triggered your anger actually is. Sure, there are times when anger is necessary or when it’s unavoidable. But they’re a small amount in comparison to the things that often trigger our anger. 

No one really teaches this to their kids. Especially young boys. Whenever we had big reactions, we were told to act composed. We didn’t dissect our feelings and try to resolve them. We just put them away. If your parents weren’t extremely strict, you may have even been praised when you hit a bully back. I was. The issue with that is that they don’t really teach us how to process and control our negative emotions. They only teach us to hold them in for as long as possible until we snap. 

However, that anger is useless when it comes to small interactions, relationships, inconveniences, or whatever else triggers your rage. Constantly being angry is unhealthy. It will make you a recluse and you’ll forget all the good qualities about yourself. Anger hides the best parts of ourselves. So, remember that if you’re unhappy in life or you find yourself angry at those around you, it’s time to think about where that anger is coming from. When you find yourself getting tense, loosen your fists. Take a deep breath. Think about what made you angry and if it’s worth ruining your mood or making you do something extreme. It’s hard sometimes in the middle of the anger, but do those things first before that anger takes over. You’ll be happier. 

Of course, a therapist is always the best option. I also get therapy is expensive, some people don’t believe in it, or opening up is extremely difficult. These are things I’ve taken from my experiences and they have helped. Especially taking a deep breath because a lot of people tend to forget to breath when they’re extremely focused. My mom used to say people take deep sighs because they were thinking so hard that they forgot to breathe. Take a deep breath and take your control back.",1
"It is almost like an addiction. When I'm playing an online game and I get killed or think the battle is unfair I will insult and swear at people. Sometimes I find it funny just to insult someone if they were annoying me.

The worrying thing is it sometimes spills over into real life. This morning I almost lost my footing on the pavement and swore out loud in front of strangers before I even knew what I was doing.

I am angry as fk in real life. I am normal, fit and in shape and don't hate myself (i think) but have struggled to get proper employment since graduating and spend a lot of time doing nothing. I think the isolation has mentally destroyed me. I am bitter about it working so hard at uni and in jobs and I can't move on with my fucking life. Also most of my friends moved away for work or just moved on in life so I am isolated with no escape. I go to social clubs but it doesn't help much.",1
"Apologies if this doesn't belong here. I should probably use a throwaway but I don't care. 

When I say I'm hurting him, I don't mean physically. I'd like to say I would never, but I honestly don't know. 

When I get angry, it feels like this pressure inside me,  and if I don't release it, I'm going to explode. The best way to release it is to throw things, but especially if I'm mad at myself, then hitting myself works too. Screaming to a lesser degree.  And then the zen of cleaning up relaxes me. 

My husband has asked me again and again not to throw things. It upsets him and affects him negatively. I promise to be better but I keep doing it. My defense is always, but they teach kids to do this sort of thing so they don't hurt other people, he's overreacting. But I don't get to decide that. 

Tonight he yelled back at me for the first time. He cried. For a minute, i was genuinely afraid he was going to have a heart attack or something. He's too young for that. 

I need to be better for real. I don't know how. What are some things that help you?",1
"Almost every time I get angry, it's just a certain thought that loops over and over and I don't even identify that I'm angry.  I know I'm feeling anger, but I don't even have the thought of ""Hey, I'm angry.  I should do one of the things my therapist told me to do to get out of this.""  I don't even have the thought of ""I'm angry.""  The only thought I have is the thing that's pissing me off.

I am literally incapable of pulling myself out of this crap most times.

I'm in therapy, taking meds, and nothing is working.

Has anyone been here?  Any ideas that could help?",1
"I know that I let people’s actions and words control mine. It isn’t an excuse. But I feel trapped, and have nowhere to go physically and emotionally. So I resort to anger. Sorry, not really much to say or ask for. Just trying to calm down, as everything just/is happening. 😪",1
"Now we’re on the verge of a second breakup, a second breakup because of the same thing but she clearly is in denial of her issue. What can I do for her to realize how toxic it is before it’s too late ? 

Obviously I take responsibility for some of the things I did but literally every disagreement turns into a burst of cursing, even physical abuse and sheer anger. Whenever I tell her that our relationship never worked because there’s this monster between us, she says “I wouldn’t be angry if you didn’t make me angry”. What she fails to understand is that feeling anger is normal, but expressing it by swearing and hitting your loved one isn’t. She can’t seem to understand the thick line between the two. 

Also her anger has driven us apart and now she literally feels like shit every time we have a disagreement, because we can’t discuss ANYTHING in a calm and civil manner, we’ve never actually done that. 

I really hope some of you can give me some tips to help us get through this. I tried to ask her to see a therapist, I even to talk her into a couple therapy but she gets so offended every time because, as she says, “I’m the only one to blame (for driving her crazy/making her angry”. She snaps out of nothing. 

Sorry about the long post :/",1
"I recently got a grade back over a minor speech in our class and it was a C. I was annoyed at first because I put a lot of time into it, but overall even though I heavily disagree on the criteria put in place I could understand how I did badly on it. 

But then I started to think about it a bit, and think of how I need straight A's this semester, and i started pacing around my room tapping my hands. And how speeches that were thoroughly bad with less effort put into them would score higher. How these people were placed higher than me and I was ""lower"". Then the outburst started and I broke a door. 

When outbursts happen for me they tend to happen when I just start thinking about something and it bounces around in the wrong way and I start yelling and eventually start hitting things.",1
"I can't do social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter anymore.

I had to delete my Facebook over a month ago because I would always get angry at something. Even the littlest things. I would get angry at the government, at communities, at the police, and at people I was ""friends"" with. I would make horribly hate-filled posts, and viciously call out people I deemed stupid. A friend of mine told me she had to remove me because of how easily I let my anger motivate extremist anti-govt posts. Who knows how many people have done the same.

I had to delete the already-useless Teitter account I had because of the same things. People would be absolute morons, and I would not hesitate to insert my two cents. I slowly realised that I am not a person that even I would want to be around when I get so ridiculously angry.

Aggression isn't something I'm partial to in anybody, which makes me question why I escalate to rapidly. The sight of something very irritating makes my blood begin to boil, and it almost feels like I get tunnel vision focusing on that irritant. Then I proceed to ""open my mouth""--as I could say since it's online--and the anger and the hate flow.

So I decided to isolate myself from those platforms. I remove the little Google headline things on the main page of anything pertaining to Trump, or the police, or stupid gossip bits.

If I stop focusing on them, my anger will subside, right?

I wish that was the case, but even something like some girl being a judgmental douche about breast sizes makes me want to create a new twitter account and freakin' rip into her. While the eerily intense anger persists, I'm at least getting better at picking my battles.

But it's exhausting. I can't talk to people that I thought used to be my friends--how can I know when there's no form of contact with anybody outside of work anymore? I bother my significant other when they tell me about people being stupid online, and my first reaction is telling them to tell said stupid person they're being a cunt.

It's exhausting.",1
"Most of my college friends turned out to be real pieces of s\*\*\*. They're arrogant bullies, they have nothing to show for in their lives, but for some reason they have an over inflated sense of self-worth. They take pleasure in putting others and sometimes each other down. I even did business with one of them a while ago, he turned out to be a real slime ball. I never confronted him about it, I just cut him off and moved on, but he's passive aggressive about it and I have a sneaky suspicion that he harbored the groups' opinion against me. I'm a generally easy going positive guy, but in that group, and where I come from, that's considered a weakness and a sign of gullibility. Except in reality, I've achieved far more in my career alone than any of them (they've basically never left home and just did the same thing since college, while I traveled and worked in many places around the world and respected in my profession). Nonetheless, they ridicule my life choices and opinions. They bring up politics a lot, which I wasn't really into until I started googling what they talk about. Figured that a lot of what they communicate is misinformation. For example, they make fun of me moving to central Europe because it's a place, according to them, for 'lazy communists and stupid socialists'.

I've recently left the group because it wasn't a healthy environment and I don't want to associate with these people, and I didn't think making a statement before I left about how misinformed they are would have been productive. I also never confronted that slime ball. I simply walked off politely and shut that door. I feel like I did the right thing, but I'm also angry at all that. I keep coming up with smart things to respond to them in the shower kinda moments. I also sometimes feel like I cut them way too much slack back in the day. It's a shame that they are like that at the end, since at this age, I find that I have no friends anymore.",1

" 

Why do some people get into a rage? Most of us at some time or another get angry. People who are prone to lose their temper, often talk themselves into a hole. This self-talk can cause real damage to the anger-prone person and their relationship with others. This self-talk is often based on false assumptions and misinformation.

Marcus Aurelius said it well, “How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.”

The truth is:-

**1. Nobody can put us down** or make us feel like worthless without our permission. We allow ourselves to get angry by-

(a) telling ourselves that the other person means to put us down

(b) believing that if they put us down, we must be insignificant

(c) Therefore we should react with anger to what we believe to be insults and put-downs.

**2. Rarely do the words or actions** of others have the sole purpose of hurting us. People rarely have a vested interest in telling us that we are worthless.

3**. Even if the put down is intended,** we can stay cool, and not get upset, hurt, provoked or angry unless we choose to. While we may like the other person putting us down, we can choose not to get upset over the whole thing.

**4. When we interpret another person’s actions or choices** (being late, buying a new car for himself instead of a washing machine for me, interrupting us and so forth) as commentaries on me, I am “Personalizing”. Such personalizing interpretations are nearly always wrong. People do what they do for their own reasons and these seldom center on us.

**5. Although we may not like someone else’s behavior towards us**, we don’t need to tell ourselves how terrible, awful and infuriating it is. Instead, we can tell ourselves that there is no particular reason to expect that others will always behave in ways that we consider best for us. The fact is that nobody is perfect and everybody does wrong on occasions, even to us.

**6. We do not have the right to be exempt from bad treatment** by others. We can only change how we react to it. Why should we tell ourselves that such things are shocking and really dreadful when in reality they are par for the course?

**7. Should we always expect that circumstances will always go our way?** If they do not, does it mean that all is lost? How we respond to these circumstances is what is important.

**8. We should not get upset** over this or anything else. Self-control is a choice.

**9. Why should we claim a right to be angry and upset,** since getting upset and staying that way harm us more than the other person? Why should we want the right to give ourselves ulcers and high blood pressure? Why should we want the right to be miserable because we believe that someone else did us wrong?

**10. The Bible teaches us to forgive** instead of claiming the right to be angry. Forgiveness to a brother, or to an enemy, for hurting us is a good alternative to remaining bitter or a long time.",1

"I guess I never saw it coming because it's less common for women to have this issue. I've always been a fairly avoidant person, and in my relationship this has come an issue because obviously communication is important.

 As I've been working on becoming less avoidant, I've realized the reason I avoid things,  is because at the core I get very irritated to the point of intense anger. I think I've always been reluctant to embrace that energy. But as I become more in tune with my emotions,  that anger has began to rear its head more often. 

Today I had an intense screaming tantrum(alone in my car) because my boyfriend forgot a relationship milestone that we were looking forward to. You can see in my post history. I was just screaming and hitting my car and balling. My ears are ringing and my heart is still pumping. I haven't had a blow up like that since middle school.
I feel scared of myself and yet still so angry. 


I've seen my dad become so angry at trivial things and laughed at him in the past for it. I always found it ridiculous. Now I'm starting to feel the aggravation of having to wrestle with that intense emotion as it takes over you. I hate it. I feel bad for ever laughing at him. 

 I feel like I'm always battling/ fighting with myself to maintain people in my life. And now this feels like one more obstacle,  one more thing that's wrong with me on top of everything else. I feel like I'm never going to just have a normal relaxed life. 
Sorry for the rant.",1
"I’m a father of 2 great kids. Lucky to have them and a very cool wife who loves us all greatly. 

I can’t seem to hold it together many days when they misbehave. What starts as a simmering annoyance at things like not listening, making a mess, or them getting angry themselves and acting out, by the end of the day often turns into bursts of anger I just can’t seem to wrangle and control. I wind up shouting even though I’ve read all of the internet articles 100x by now. It makes everybody feel like crap, most of all me. I don’t seem to have other triggers, it’s always the kids not following expected behaviors. Starting to become (who i am i kidding, HAS become) a consuming and exhausting part of the day for everybody. 

I’m looking into counseling- tho I have a fear that I will happen upon someone who just isn’t that great or experienced with this issue and give me “blanket” suggestions. 

I’m also wondering if there is anything I can do to help myself in the meantime besides read the articles that repeat how bad it is to yell. I find suggestions like deep breathing etc unfortunately worthless, I start to breathe deeply when I’m getting angry already and it almost just adds fuel and a sense of failure, focusing the anger to a bright spark. I’ve written down triggers and thought about them for hours upon hours. The triggers are simple: kids don’t listen, and it drives me up the wall.

Another thing I’ve noted for myself is I often feel like the day just doesn’t progress as I feel it should. We often wake up, lay about, nothing gets done, the kids entertain themselves, I’m not pursuing my own interests, nor am I teaching or really entertaining the kids, nothing is happening. It’s overwhelming and feels like being trapped and not having an identity or purpose. I like purpose. I like to have progress. But I just feel stuck many days. I suggest things to my wife and she just doesn’t want to do them, so we sit around the house. This is where I feel like the anger might “stem” from.",1
"First of all, im autistic and have ADHD so its already a bad combo, on top of this my dad has a really bad ager issue so most of it is probably genetic. 

But today I broke my second TV. Mistakes like that aren't cheap, both this and the last one were around £150 ($180-190 ish).

Its opened my eyes to how bad it's becoming and I need to find out what I can do and where I can go. Figured I'd start with my good old friends on Reddit.",1
"i think i have anger issues. my dad has rlly bad anger issues and i dealt w it a lot growing up, and i’m noticing a lot of his tendencies in myself and it’s really scary. if i’m sad, i just express my sadness as anger and take it out on ppl around me who i love. it’s rlly been effecting my life recently and i don’t want to hurt ppl like my father has hurt me bc of his anger issues. i want to learn how to stop this cycle bc it’s not healthy for me or anyone around me. someone give me some advice on this",1
"My sister is super hypocritical, and can be neglectful to her dog at times. It goes against every fiber of my being. I've tried talking to her about it, but she's too stubborn and in her own head to care. As a result, when I'm alone, I get a little toxic, cussing, and punching things. Is there anyway to help me not feel so angry?",1
"Once again my mom does some bull shit. I'm actually typing this almost immediately after this happened too, so at like 10:56am on my end. 

So I just woke up, and after laying around for a couple seconds I get my phone and start watching a video, it's like about 2 minutes long. As soon as that video is done my mom comes into my room saying she's gonna start taking my stuff away if I don't clean my room or wash my clothes, even though I do both of those things (this is the issue of her thinking I'm irresponsible). She's aggravated that my room isn't clean, only problem is that it is, and the only thing wrong is my carpet is flipped upside down. She's also aggravated that I sometimes leave cups out at night for her to clean in the morning, okay. I admit I do that, been trying to put more stuff in the dishwasher, sometimes when everyone else has gone to bed I even pack it and start it, but I guess I get no thanks for that even after I tell her. Guess if I forget a couple times and I'm the spawn of satan because you gotta put 1 or 2 cups in the sink. So yeah she is aggravated that my room is ""dirty"" and I'm aggravated that she's coming into my room not even 5 minutes after I wake up already bitching and moaning about literally everything I do with my life. So I be a dumbass and not hold my tongue as usual, and I say her voice is grating and aggravating in the morning, and I question why she does this so early in the morning thinking I'm going to listen to it. Like she didn't even let me eat breakfast. The fuck? Pretty sure if she told me this AFTER breakfast I would've been fine. A little annoyed but I wouldn't have snapped at her multiple times, and I probably wouldn't have screamed at the to of my lungs at her with multiple curses and threats, either. I was going: ""What the fuck is the goddamn problem my room's perfectly fine it's not a place where bombs fuckin' went off with glass on the floor and shit!!"" and even after I say that the first time she still just says with no emotion in her voice at all: ""It's dirty"". So I continue yelling the same thing, and then I yell this: ""Do you WANT to get fucking punched again!? Well that's fine by me- let's get some full blown fucking physical abuse in this damn house since I've apparently done that already more than once!! Do you fucking get off on pissing me off!? Do you LIKE getting punched!? Do you get off at being punched!?  (The day I punched my mom was the only time I laid a finger on her since I was in 4th grade, back then I was STILL dealing with anger management and temper tantrums, back then when I wouldn't get what I wanted I'd kick the back of her car seats and get home and hit her in the stomach, once I took out a knife to try and stab but then I broke down crying and hugged her instead. Yeah idk either.). I hate how it feels like she's baiting me, and I can only realize I've been baited after I've already went off. She turned my phone off too (She has this thing called Qustodio downloaded on my sister's and I's phones. It shuts it off at a certain time, blocks certain websites, and my parents have full control over what we and what we can do, and at what time, so they can turn it off anytime they want.). I swear its like she gets off on this shit or something. Why else would she constantly try to aggravate everyone and make herself seem like the victim? She even does it with dad and my sisters sometimes. They'll pack away the food after dinner or put dishes in the dish washer when mom asks, but then mom will get mad at them because ""they didn't do it correctly"" which translates to: ""you didn't do it the way I wanted you to do it!"", and then rant to herself (we still hear it) about how: ""Nothing gets done right in this fucking house. I have to do everything myself. Nobody ever does anything around here they just sit on their asses playing video games or going out..."". Just imagine dealing with that everyday, as well as other shit eating up at you on the inside. It's no wonder I'm so pissed off at literally everything sometimes. 

The TL:DR is that I got into an argument with my mom almost as soon I woke up in the morning, she kept on ranting about how nothing gets done in the house when it comes to me, I get angry and yell and threaten her as per usual, she turns my phone off (also as per usual) and I conclude she's doing this on purpose because she does this other the other people in the house, with them also getting pissed off (dad and oldest sister) or emotionally pummeled (older sister, she usually just goes into her room when she senses an argument about to occur. Wish I could do that.)

I know some people on here have posted about feeling baited, and usually the answer is to walk away, but my mom is the type to always get the last word in no matter what, so often times when you think an argument is done, my mom will come back in like 30 seconds or a minute, even an hour after the fact with the same exact complaint to rile you up again. Anyone have some advice on how I can avoid getting baited and how I can avoid getting so pissed off early in the morning (btw after today's incident I tried to practice taking deep long breaths as another redditor and my therapist suggested. It actually helped a lot. Thanks!)",1
"Ok, apparently after my girlfriend broke up with me it was all calm and we stayed friends after. for some fucking reason some asshole at school really had the audacity to spread rumors that she left because she liked another guy... I promised myself I wouldn’t get in fights again after I moved countries and school, I’ve been a harmless usually happy person since then. But I really really need some way to calm the fuck down cus I honestly want to talk to this dude without any violence whatsoever",1
It's like I like being angry now. It's scares me that I like it. I love the feeling of pure strength and pure rage coursing through my vains. I feel like I can't live without my rage. I've been angry since I was 5 and im actually scared of who and what it's made me.,1
"This is my first post here. I'm a 17 year old guy, about to be 18 in 2 weeks, and I've been diagnosed with Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Because I have trouble controlling my rage, I've destroyed property, beaten my pets, and threatened to kill my mom. Any little thing sets me off, and when I get going, all of my empathy seems to leave me, and it's been getting worse with age.

I want to have kids and a wonderful wife someday, but I feel that unless I somehow get my anger under control, I shouldn't put a wife and kids through that. It scares me, because I don't want to have to be alone my whole life. I have severe depression, and I want someone else in the house to sort of watch me and make sure I don't do anything stupid, but I also just want someone to take care of and to talk to.

Unfortunately, I have very little control over my emotions, and therapy and medication haven't done diddly squat. I am trying to get better though, but it seems like whenever I make any progress, I for some reason allow myself to go back to square one. 


I just want some opinions of what you guys think. Any replies would be greatly appreciated. Have a great day.",1
"I've noticed I fall onto a spiral of something ticking me off, so I refuse to eat simply out of spite. Then I get hungry and even more easily frustrated, which will make me want to eat even less. I'll avoid social interaction, being productive, exercise, most of everything until I finally eat a little late into the evening. 

Anyone else do this? What do you do to help stop this spiral?",1
"Hello! This is my first post on here, was looking around a little. So I was diagnosed with ODD about last school year and I've been trying to deal with my anger and such, but every time I think I've got it in the bag, something always comes up and messes with my mojo (I like to draw and run my anger/stress off whenever I feel its getting to be too much. I also have problems with bottling up my anger at others). Now that the introduction is out of the way, I've been dealing with anger for much longer than 1 year, in fact I've had anger issues since I was four years old, temper tantrums everyday, kicking and screaming in my mom's car, hitting when I didn't get what I wanted, making threats, the works. Recently I've been going to therapy for my anger since I want to get better at controlling my anger (I'm 15 female btw). A couple days ago my mom and I got into another argument, this time about what I wanted for dinner. I had no idea and everything she offered I wasn't in the mood for, she started getting aggravated at me for not knowing what I wanted and I was getting aggravated because she kept on bombarding me with restaurants and questions not giving me time to actually think over what I wanted, then she started listing the cereals we had at home because she said she was done with listing restaurants. She listed breakfast foods and after I said I don't know once again, she said I was on my own and she was done trying to help me. This is where I mess up. Unable to keep my cool I yell that I'm going to punch her in the face. This isn't the first time I've yelled like that (in fact I was originally gonna tell her to ""shut the fuck up before I fucking punch you"" so at least I can hold my tongue in the cursing regard...), so mom didn't take me seriously and said: ""Go ahead! Do whatever you want!!"". That got me even angrier because she already believes I'm irresponsible, so my fight or flight response said: ""You know what? Fuck it! She's laughing you off as if you're some kind of joke! Go for it!!!"" So I get up, and I miss the first time and I see mom put this smirk on her face, so I try again and actually hit her this time. It really wasn't that hard of a punch. Didn't leave a mark, the impact sound was quiet as hell, weakest punch I ever threw. I didn't actually WANT to punch her but after I saw that smirk I just decided ""why not?"". Afterwards she looked really hurt, said she couldn't believe I could be so disrespectful and said she was completely done with me. In the days afterwards she really hasn't talked to me except asking if I was hungry, so I guess I officially fucked over my relationship with my mom for good.  The strangest thing is I don't actually regret punching her, in fact after I did I felt a lot more relaxed, and I was honestly more indifferent to the whole thing. I used to punch people who pissed me off at school all the time before I got therapy. In a journal I write my anger in, I wrote that ""I'd probably regret it tomorrow"" but I haven't, and I don't like it.

The TL:DR is mom and I were getting aggravated at each other, went up and punched her after she taunted me, fucked over our relationship for good, but strangely don't regret it or care that much about the situation despite wanting to have a good relationship with her.

Anyone else here deal with this kind of thing and can you tell me how to get better with it?",1
"I keep getting accused that I shout and get angry. But I don't even realize it. I dont even think it's shouting, for me it's normal conversation. DAE deal with this?",1
"First someone pisses you off and you want to injure that person. 

Next, you now have an assault charge and you're going to prison for a long time. 

Lots of people are assholes. Don't let the anger control you into doing this. You're better than that. Try to control your anger. Don't be a serial killer. You will regret it for the rest of your life.",1
How to deal when anger arises when someone has deliberately done something bad to you? Like they can abuse you etc but if you do it back then you got attacked?,1
"My arms are trembling rn after the latest bout of abuse she put me through and I just want my fist to connect to her face. I kinda just wanna beat her bloody and break her nose and reopen her knee surgery wound. Yeah, it’s messed up. I normally am not a violent person but when it comes to her I just want to brutally beat her. 

There were a lot of times where I did lose it and punch her but it was usually in the shoulder or something, and my dad held me back from doing more. I usually take the consequences because I don’t regret it after the fact because i feel satisfied after fighting back. I’m just not sure what would happen if she did this again and my dad wasn’t around to stop me. These thoughts scare me a little but there’s nothing else I could do to vent the reaction she incited in me. Talking doesn’t work, therapy doesn’t work. I can Grey rock all day and she’ll just yell, yell, yell all day. Until I snap and can’t take it anymore. I’m just a girl who’s tired of being put down every single day of her life.",1
"Discovered this sub just now, wanted to give it a try, maybe some people might relate maybe some will give advice.

Ever since I (M20) gotten into my teenage year i started having some very hyper aggressive thoughts on the little stuff, my little brother used to be an annoying prick that gets what he wants (now we're cool i guess), i overthink on petty stuff like how i threw a fit when one of the tomato plants i grew for a month is now dead cuz my dad watered it wrong (we argued for so long for something so dumb), how i generally hate how my big brother does his everyday things (get your life together!), how my sisters look down on me sometimes, and how my mom keeps pestering me about what to do everytime. Everytime these things happen i just want to say ""FUCK YOU!!!!"". 

My father told me once that i am very expressive about my feelings especially my anger, he said to hide my feelings more so i tried, but that just makes it worse unfortunately cuz now everytime i try to withhold my anger it just compiles in my mind and releases into a burst of anger with sometimes longer lasting moodiness. Every single time these episodes happen the after affects of it can be felt for days and i hate it. I think I've gone so deep into it that if there is something that can make me angry i will erupt and can't back down. 

I'm an asshole and I'm aware of it, I'm aware of it which makes me hate myself, i want to change but i don't know how, i can't afford therapy and that shit makes me angrier (FUCK!!!), I JUST WANT PEACE FOR FUCKS SAKE............",1
I haven't gone to bed earlier then 3am for the past week. i finally have my day off tomorrow and i got an email tonight about how they have to have me in tomorrow for 4 hours. i lost myself completely. i tore up a $ 120 headset for my xbox and put my hand through my lamp. i have no friends outside of school and all i do is kiss the teachers balls all day. i would never take our anger on a human. i just wish i got a day to myself to heal myself and comfort myself. i'll just have to settle for the weed and the crying myself to sleep every night until i get a day off,1
"So I just had a kind of epiphany: I've been angry for at least three years. Not the kind that explodes into rage, more like the kind that has festered, been let out in small bursts when I'm alone and that has now clogged up my emotions all together. 

My girlfriend and I are going through a bit of a crisis these days. It's not the first, but it might be the last. We've been arguing a lot over a long period of time, and the end of it was that we more or less broke up, because she was convinced that I ""had not loved her for the last three years."" To be fair, I haven't done enough to show her how I feel and just be present, and here comes my point.

I think that I have been angry all this time. Like I said, not angry in the ""I'm yelling and throwing things around"", but just me being resentful towards most of the world. My girlfriend, my friends, my family, my work, people that I don't even know - and, most of all, myself. Looking back, I can't even recognize myself in the guy that I see in the ""mirror"". 

It's been a tough realization, but at the same time it kind of felt like something fell into place. Like I figured out what was ""wrong"" with me. Now comes the hard work of letting go of it, which I really hope that I can do, because I believe that it will make me a better person. Does this make sense to anyone else? And do anyone have any experience with this?",1
"Me (35F) and my husband (36M) had a huge fight last night. We were getting ready for bed when he asked me to log onto our bank account and check something. He knows that I don't like doing anything financial related before going to bed, but he has been putting it off, so I agreed. I was mildly irritated at this point and he took notice.

Anyway, I log in to our account, it's a new bank account and the interface is totally not user-friendly, so I am getting a little more irritated because I can't find what I am looking for. It is pretty late at this point (around midnight) and I was really tired from working all day and had a headache - which he also knew. I do my best not to curse at the screen and successfully find the thing I was looking for. After that, I write a short mail in his name, with my husband's eyes glued on my fingers.

When all of that was finished, I needed a release from my frustration so I let out a whispered ""stupid bullshit"". And he said ""What do you mean, 'just a little bit'? And I reply ""Why would I say ""Just a little bit"", I never said that, I said ""Stupid bullshit"". And I admit, my tone of voice was pissed. I was tired, frustrated, had a headache and just wanted to go to bed. He said ""Wow! Stop attacking me! That wasn't necessary!"" and starts throwing things around. I said ""You are blowing this up, I was just frustrated from doing stressy things online that I'd rather not do before going to bed. You are making a little thing into something huge"". And he said ""Little thing??? For me, that is huge! You are attacking me! Stop attacking me!"" And I tried to calm him down, again saying I wasn't attacking him, just letting out my frustration. And then I saw him smirking and I calmly said ""Okay, if you are just going to make fun of me now, I don't see the point in this"". I slowly got up and went to the bathroom. I heard something break. He threw a mug against the wall with my face on it that he purchased a week after we got together. When I faced him, he said ""This is how you make me feel!"" I pointed to the broken mug and said ""And that's how you make *me* feel"" (I meant to say that he makes me feel broken into pieces). And then I went into the bedroom because I really didn't want any more drama. He has been that way multiple times before and I found out from past experiences that leaving the room and the situation usually calms him down. But not last night.

He started kicking against our front door. Our front door has a glass window and he kept kicking the door until the glass broke. He also said things like ""Whenever I ask you to do something, you are in a terrible mood! You never want to do anything for me!"" (I do, just not around midnight. I do more for him that he realizes but has taken for granted). I just let him rant at this point. It was one blame after the next. I'm sure all our neighbors know by now what a terrible wife I am. But I couldn't care less what they think.

I crawled inside the bed and pulled the sheets over my face, trembling in fear with our dog, who was also trembling like crazy. My husband came back five minutes later in silence. He started cleaning up the glass and the broken mug and when he was done, came into bed and started apologizing. I wasn't able to say anything, out of fear that everything would escalate again. And today, it is awkward to be around him. He is fixing the glass window right now, but I just don't feel safe around him. And I feel like I can't be myself around him, because he can't deal with my negative emotions. I never raise my voice or anything, it's just the 'tone of my voice' that triggers him, he says.

He asked me to find help for him.

What can I do in a situation like this? How can I help him? I feel like this is something he should do on his own? I know he had a rough childhood and probably needs therapy for that. If there is one thing I have learned about people is that you can't change them. They have to be willing to change and make an effort themselves.",1
"This is just a quick post to say thank you to everyone whose posts I have read. There is so much I can relate to, and I'm glad we're here helping each other, and that I'm not alone.",1
"I woke up today kind of feeling crappy. Allergies or something have been bothering me for about 4 days now and I haven't felt good the whole time. I did get a good night's rest last night, but still felt tired, probably from taking benadryl every 4 hours and just being run down in general. I made myself breakfast, cleaned up, and as I was leaving for work I told myself, ""No matter what anybody does on the road, I'm going to be ok with it. I'll leave it as their problem."" I have a huge issue with how people drive, and I really make myself crazy with it. Tailgating, cutting people off, going slow in the left lane, and a few other things really get me worrying about other people's business and I let it mess up my day. 

So I get on the highway, and it's packed as usual, morning rush hour, but it's still moving slowly. I'm about a mile from my exit (on the road about 10 minutes at this point), in the left lane behind a line of cars, and this little Cavalier comes flying up the middle lane, goes into the right lane to pass a truck going slow in the middle lane, which for some reason triggers me. Part of me wants to just go faster, but I also get a wave of ""why is this fast lane going so slowly"" thoughts happening. I accelerate and move into the middle lane, and see that it's wide open in front of the slow truck, and about 4 vehicles ahead of where I was in the left lane I see some middle-aged guy in a dually driving in the left lane, not moving over to let the people behind him pass. The people behind him had enough room to go around him on the right, and they probably just weren't letting it bother them like I was. For some reason I really feel annoyed with the lead left-lane cruiser, so I get up next to him, wait for him to look over, and I flip him off. 

I'm pretty conflicted at this point, because I've lost my cool, and I'm vacillating between feeling like this guy needs his ass handed to him for being a dumbass, and feeling foolish for letting something so petty get me this pissed off. The fact that I'm aware of it in the midst of it is progress, however, because in the past I was fully convinced that anybody who didn't do anything perfectly needed to be beaten into submission so they would quickly see the error of their ways. SMH, I have become my abusive parents.

I was able to reflect more about it, though. I thought to myself ""What made me so irritable?"" I then realized that I was ruminating on bad memories earlier. I had gotten back in touch with an ex-girlfriend who was very disrespectful, however seems apologetic about it now, and wants to buy me dinner for my birthday. I'm conflicted on that also, because logic tells me to just keep it casual, but loneliness and sexual desire make me want to believe that we may have a second chance. I also got to ruminating about my friend that I live with making snide remarks about things such as how I arrange the furniture in my room, or how she won't be firm with her dog and enables his crazy behavior. He's a good dog, he just pees in the house a lot, barks a lot when excited, and is in the habit of jumping on people, all behaviors that she reinforces without seeming to realize it. It's all stuff I can live with, but when I'm in my ""fuck everybody"" mood, I'll focus on the fact that she's doing something wrong and let it bother me. She also likes to leave dishes in the sink, which cranks up my anxiety about bugs and unclean conditions in the kitchen. It's all stuff I know I can learn to live with.

So my epiphany was that the earlier rumination set the stage for intolerance. I was tired already and not feeling good. I was repeatedly re-hashing things in my head that bothered me. That put me in a mindset to nitpick other behavior that I saw. Heavy traffic contributed to the stress a bit, and then seeing someone driving aggressively, plus someone else driving in a way that I felt was inconveniencing others, was the little thing that I allowed to set me off. I feel like being more aware of toxic rumination causing a negative mindset will help. That may be one thing that will really help me progress in making improvements with my behavior. Catch the bad thoughts, tell myself ""it's ok, it's gone now, we don't have to have that in our lives any more"", and then some deep breathing, thoughts of things for which I'm grateful, and any other positive memories I can think of. Thank you for reading my post. Let's have a good day.",1
So I've been having this issue lately where i get really angry and my first instinct is to hit either something or myself. I haven't really told anyone about it (only really mentioned it with one of my friends) and I'm only young as well. I've had minor anxiety problems in the past and I'm thinking that might be the cause of it? Listening to music really helps me and so does art and reading.,1
"I completely lost my cool tonight biking to my volleyball game when someone else on a bike cut me off. I ended up hitting their back tire with my front tire, doubling down when they asked what my problem was, and following the person and calling them names. I realized that I was en route to where I needed to go anyway; and around this time also realized that I had scared the every loving crap out of this person. At this point they’re telling me to stop following them and they’re going to call the cops. I tried to act calm and said we all have places to go. Eventually we pass a police station and the dude stops and tells the officer I’m following and threatening. I said “I’m just going to my volleyball game right down here” turns out the guy is going to the same place. Great. 

So my irrational actions now completely bite me since I’m now mortified to face this guy in front of my teammates after I acted like such an ass. I proceed to just sit in the general area of my game for 45 minutes and then head home because I didn’t want my wife to wonder why I was home so early. She can’t stand when I get angry like that. We had had a nice dinner before I left for the game and it just would have ruined her day too if I told her about it. 

I have been reasonably chill for a while but this was basically the worst case that I always knew these angry reactions could create - where I would actually have to answer for it outside of the vacuum I get in when I lash out like that. Acting like nothing else matters. I chilled out for that 45 minutes and biked home and am still just feeling about as low as I’ve ever felt. I’m hoping this will be the lesson it needs to be. Feeing a bit better but still just awful, awful. About to have a snack and watch some tv with the wife and I’m hoping I’ll be able to sleep ok :(",1
Recently I’ve been getting angry at work and I would get pissy.  This used to happen back then but I wouldn’t project it on people just my work.

"I grew up extremely angry and hostile, but when I was being raised I was taught to be more calm. Unfortunately, now I rarely feel more than mild annoyance, even to things that I should be furious or frustrated about, like attacks to my character or coming up short in a competition that I care a lot about. This has sort of made me to be known as kind of a pushover and I can feel a lack of any intensity in me. I have no doubt I will be able to channel the emotions, but how can I find them within myself?",1
"I can't stop getting into arguments, It's annoying to be honest, but I feel like my opinions should be heard but I just want to ignore someone and just walk away but it's so hard to do... any tips?",1
I have some pretty bad anger issues to the point of self harm. Everytime i try to get better at something i get angry and just cant control my anger. Usually i break something bit if my parents out home i will usually punch my head or bite myself. I just feel like damage needs to be done. I get so mad just because im not good at anything. No matter how many years of work.,1
"I used to have some spontaneous anger issues, but then I started picking up meditation. 
Now, I just feel no urge to be mad. The little things do not bother me anymore because in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter to me. I've found no reason to be mad.
Try it out, maybe try setting aside 10 minutes of your day to start. Also remember that meditation doesn't need to be a set time, you can do it anytime, anywhere, it's just a state of mind to settle into whether for 10 seconds or for 10 minutes.",1
"I just had an argument with my (61 M) girlfriend (58 F) a couple weeks ago over me completely misunderstanding her and getting unreasonably pissed.  She was at my house and we had been out to a nice dinner, which I bought and then ruined.  I was mad and  sent her home, I didn't want to sleep with her, we sleep together poorly and I knew it would suck when we were both mad on top of it.  Once she left, I realized I was completely out of line (realized I had misinterpreted her), emailed her a big apology and said I was stupid and completely wrong. We talked the next day and it went well, but it left a stain and that's on me.  

So I volunteer to go to her house the next weekend and work in the yard with her, we work well together and it's fun.  Her neighbor has a large German Shepherd that seems pretty vicious and barks non-stop, weighs around 100 lbs and is showing teeth etc behind the fence not far away.   The neighbors are out in the fenced yard, I can hear them talking behind the treeline, the day goes on. At one point, I am in the middle of her 1 acre backyard carrying stuff to the burn pile and I hear the dog barking and realize it's very close. I turn around and it's 20 feet behind me, on a dead run to me, in full attack mode. I freak and realize I need to scare him, so I run at him full speed yelling like a damn fool.  He runs back in  his yard and I am super adrenalized.  I know dogs well, I have 2.  So it's super irresponsible to let an essentially vicious dog loose. Had it been my confrontation fearing girlfriend, she would have ran or froze and most likely gotten bitten. She also takes her 2 year old grandson in the yard alot and that would have been really ugly.  I am sure the dog getting out was accidental but I nearly got torn up and I was supremely unhappy. I yelled over the fence at the neighbors (who were behind a evergreen tree line and were 20 feet away but out of view) that if that FUCKING dog ever came at me again, I would kill it and have Animal Control come get its corpse.  I yelled several times and said FUCK several times, which my girl friend hates, she's a bit of a church girl, hates confrontation etc.  

So because of nearly getting shredded, I lost my shit AGAIN.  GF is not happy. I don't think she understands being adrenalized but that is my thing, once my temper gets up, rational thought is over for a bit.  The timing was not good. I am trying to get her to sell her house and me to sell mine and us buy a house together, but I suspect she is having second thoughts.  I hate myself for this shit!",1
"I’m grouchier.  Ever since I was teenager people keep calling me the grouchy one and I hate it.

I’ve been told in the past to chill out, yet I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to just to do so.  I’ve tried meditation, I’ve tried venting on reddit, I’ve tried exercising. I don’t know.  Maybe it’s something genetic I got from my dad who has a lot of anger issues.

I hold more grudges and get into more fights with my mom.  I feel like ultimately she doesn’t understand what it’s like to me, and she doesn’t give me the time or space to vent in healthy way.  Just within 24 hours we’re have over five heated arguments.

I can’t find time to relax cause I’m either stressed, axious or depressed

I keep faking my mood until i snap. Most of what makes me snap i am unable to talk about or find the words for so I just have to say ‘I’m tired’ or ‘I need to be alone’

I fantasize what it would be like to be someone else who isn’t angry dude - mostly as awesome a comic artist that inspires me or one of the guests on my favorite DND podcast

I try to distract myself with arts projects, gaming, or social media until I sleep. I still can’t find a job to replace my internship where they have stopped giving me work and pay.

I always hate waking up. I rarely have any days where I feel excited, even on birthdays or vacations. I keep thinking I should have run away or followed up my suicide attempts sometimes sometimes .

Even when I try really hard to be positive, I expect the worst from people and situations. Thus I have started to avoid conversation and going out entirely unless it’s for errands.  I’ve even started to avoid my art communities just to come here and vent through a throwaway account.

I feel/worry like everyone around me actually thinks I’m stupid
When I try to discuss something I have a problem with I keep getting told I’m rude or argumentative. A part of me wonders if I really am that way, or if it’s because the other person is stubborn

I’ve have tried to act as a therapist for my abused mom ever since dad left us, yet all we have doing lately is fighting non-stop.

My mind is almost obsessed with revenge whenever I am not gaming or doing art. However what keeps me from acting on these vengeful feelings is knowing that it’s unimpossible or unlikely I will actually achieve anything good ( and probably end up in worse place for doing a bad thing)

As much as I try to fake being optimistic, kind and encouraging...deep down I have a dark side and dark thoughts and that keep telling me I’m selfish, I’m a hypocrite, and that i’ll Never be enough and am doomed to be cast aside by my friends and fans of my art.

But When I think about myself, the first and only things that keep coming to mind are my flaws, mistakes, regrets, and shitty choices (in the short term and long term)

I try to work really hard to tell myself I am not that negative person with some good things about my life. I try to tell myself to be proud and happy that I finished my Masters, that I still have friends around me and we hang out, that my mom is happy that I stay with her, that I paint amazing artwork that I’ve been told inspires others on their art projects, that even when I fall short of being good that I always can try to do my best in the future, that I’ve worked hard and have earned the right to play hard, and that I’m nothing like the monster I fear I am

But often times I keep wondering if Maybe I am a monster and I should just give up on life.",1
"It's been almost years since I'm venting anger by self-harm. I'm having daily arguments with my parents every time I grunt noisily and punch myself very hard. I'm pissed off not only at play but also at work, on minor inconveniences and mistakes. A wrong press of the button with my keyboard or grammatical lapses makes me mad. A new window pos up or my phone rotates and I'm pissed off. It causes my stomach to bloat and hurt every time I try to not react violently. Every time I commit a mistake, I go in a state of panic and anger.  I'm ashamed that I'm a pain in the ass for my aging parents. I'm struggling to change but my anger still wins. I already tried therapy from a counselor but I fail to follow her instructions. I don't find anger journal helpful since I know my trigger: ""making mistakes"". I can't get over from the instances in my life where I got scolded terribly by classmates, teachers, supervisors and project leads when I make mistakes. That gave me the reason to avoid committing mistakes at and I perform a disturbing self-flagellation for each mistake I make. My brain shouts at me ""UNACCEPTABLE"" every time I make mistakes and I proceded to grunt and punch myself to the point of pestering mg parents. How should I change my mindset? I can no longer accept failures and mistakes. There is also a part of me of self-sabotaging so that I make mistakes.",1
What is a good place to put my anger in to? Rn I punch walls and it hurts like shit(they are from concrete) and hand trainers etc or whatever they are called dont work?,1
"We’re on vacation and tonight after dinner was the most explosion I’ve seen. He got a little tispy tonight at dinner and said some things I didn’t like. I got upset and started walking back to the hotel and just didn’t say anything to him which I know set him off. We got back to the room and he just starts rambling off a string of hateful words to me. It escalated even more because that made me more upset so I yelled at him and started crying which made him more upset. The fight ended with him punching himself in the head several times and my foot being hurt. It was a really ugly situation tonight and I felt violated, abused, and afraid of him. I’m at a loss at the moment. I’ve set boundaries with him on what’s appropriate and what’s not. Things that absolutely cross a line for me and I feel like he uses that against me. Hateful, dirty names are the line for me and tonight he was just SO hateful and it all started because I was upset about what he said at dinner. I know that if I had let it go we wouldn’t be in this situation, but I don’t think I should have to and by pushing away my hurt feelings to calm him down, I feel like it’s just essentially giving him a free pass and he won’t take me seriously in the future. I don’t know where to draw the line because a lot of what happened tonight will stick with me for a long time even though I know he said it to get a rise out of me and a lot was said out of anger. He’s the best thing that’s happened to me most of the time but this is the 3rd or 4th outburst since we’ve been dating and it’s only gotten worse. His words sting me and they stick with me. When is enough enough? Is it anger or abuse at this point? I don’t want to be the reason he tips over the line but I also don’t want to just be walked over to make sure he’s not going to explode.",1
"These spells used to go away but now they keep returning more frequently. Whenever I get them I start imagining myself grabbing the people I care about and smashing their face into the floor. I was doing good for a year but now it feels like I can't control myself anymore. Usually I'll snap doing something like playing video games and start tearing my place up. Even my family notices I'm getting worse. I seriously feel I'm going to end up murdering someone if I don't do something. It went from almost no anger whatsoever to getting outbursts multiple times a day and it scares me. All my repressed rage from the way my family used to treat me growing up keeps returning, please for the love of God help me before I return to the monster I used to be.",1
"I consider myself to be successful. I have a great job, I'm going to college, I have a great boyfriend, and overall a great life. There is just one thing. I'm angry. I've always had anger problems. I went to therapy, moved away from my hometown, and I thought they got better. Lately though my anger has been back and in full effect. And anger arrived with all of his other friends (fear, anxiety,  guilt). 

I'm not sure if this matters, but I was abused as a kid. I was put on the backburner. I was unheard. I digress.  My anger stays fairly dormant until I drink. When I drink it can be explosive. I don't like that. I don't want to manage my anger.... I want to be at peace. 

I think alot. I think of situations that may happen and they make me angry. I get angry about things that HAVENT even happened. I need help. I want to feel at peace again. I want to feel happy. 

If you have tips, books, or anything. I need to get this under control. I need to get the positivity back.",1
"Why can't I control it? Why is it always trying to take over me? Every little thing that upsets me from my partner, drives me into a rage and when I'm that angry, all I see is red... It's almost like the good parts of me disappear and I turn into this dark person. It's been getting worse lately with life stress but I dont know where it comes from..

I grew up in a pretty traditional Italian family. Alot of yelling, fighting and being hit by our father as kids. Is this really why I get the way I do? Is it even possible, even though I'm now in my 30s?? All I know is, I don't like who I become when it happens...my heart races, my mind shifts into this dark place and I feel very alone. It's a cold place... It makes me feel so sad afterwards because when everything cools down, the realization of what happened sets in and I'm embarrassed of myself. 

I don't like.who I become. I hate what comes out of my mouth and I'm sick of it. Please tell me I'm not alone with all of this... Has anyone felt this way and has anything helped you? I'm finally willing to try anything at this point... Thanks.",1
"I also don't know how to cope with it. I am nearing that age of graduation where you are supposed to be close with your family but for me, situations arose which broke bonds. My grandmother who has taken me on trips and gave me some nice things for my birthday decided to be utterly rude towards me and my mother. Claiming that my Mum can't raise me properly, I never talk to her during the school year, and I am a failure as I can't find a job. She has always been condescending towards me, treating me like a subhuman with the mental capacity of a peanut which led me to not talking to her a whole lot. I still felt obliged o be all good to her because she took me on trips and drove me to Model Un conferences. But after yet another conversation of Grandma being rude and even going as far as to say 'You are going to wear a dress and makeup on your graduation night' my Mum said that we needed to cut contact with her. So now I am left with no closure to tell Grandma how I really feel about her and left with pent up anger from all those years of snooty remarks about me. I would love to have some closure but I can't seem to have it and now when I am alone I burst into angry tears and even burned photos of Grandma and I in them.

Some coping advice would be welcome.",1
"4 nights ago, I went through the most terrible insomnia. I must have laid awake in bed for 3-4 hours before blessed sleep took me.

The next day, Dad told the whole family that someone forget to lock the doors at 4AM (Dad was travelling and only reached home at that hour). He was so angered by the unlocked doors that he went to everyone's rooms and turned on the lights, intending to find the culprit.

Thankfully, he didn't lose his senses, and upon seeing that everyone stayed asleep despite the brightened lights, he opted to leave everyone be, and then he went to sleep himself.

I was infuriated when I heard that he went to my room to on my light, and that he had half a mind to wake me right there and then. I kid you not, I might have went berserk at him if he had woke me up.

For some weird reason, this thing has weighted heavily on my mind the past few days. I keep imaging the scenario where I was awoken at 4 AM, and how I would have punched him out of sheer rage. The dumbest thing is that this situation didn't even happen. My sleep-deprived brain thankfully kept me asleep despite my dad's actions so we avoided a nasty confrontation.

Why do I feel so much anger over something that didn't even happen?",1
"I really need help for my anger issues. It doesn’t particularly upset me myself, but apparently it does upset the people around me.

I have destroyed four laptops, usually by throwing them at the wall.

I have destroyed two Xbox Ones by beating them with my controller and then throwing it out of my window.

I have destroyed my television by throwing my controller at it before smashing the screen with my fists.

I have destroyed three phones by stamping on them, throwing them at the wall or blowing them to pieces with an air rifle.

I have destroyed two iPads by smashing them with my hands.

I used my desk as a punching bag for a period of a month, with my latest punch causing it to break into two pieces, after which I took it into the garden and destroyed it with a sledgehammer.

I have punched a hole in my door and punched out the wooden panelling in my room. 

This often results in minor injuries to myself and apparently great disturbance to those who live with me (who are sometimes the cause).

Does anyone else suffer with destroying things as a result of anger?",1
"So I’ve fractured my knuckle two different times cause I punch the walls. Literally anything makes me angry and do this, even if I can’t learn something. How do I stop punching walls when I’m angry?",1
"Warning skip the next paragraph, it is just me self hating.


I want to die. Die to relieve myself of everything. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I think I might actually kill someone soon, so I feel like it would be better if I died rather than imprison myself or hurt anyone else. I'm so done with everything, I can't even fathom how much I just want to sleep and never wake up so I can be done. Right now, suicidal thoughts are running around my brain and picking out anything positive and killing them. I know this was all over the place but if you could provide some feedback that would be great.

"Anyone have any techniques/tips on dealing with anger issues in a sporting environment? Generally a good guy away from the pitch but when on the sidelines I have an issue with dealing with poor decisions, especially when our players are at risk of getting hurt.

Players bailed me out with a solid win but I have to be able to walk away from situations and use my mouth to the team's betterment, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",1
"I have a thousand very good reasons to be angry with him. And a few hundred of those are the reasons why I *loathe* him.

But it's like an obsession. Whenever I remember something he's done, I'm so consumed with anger that I can't think or do anything. I get absolutely gruesome revenge fantasies and find myself wishing I had done something awful to him while I was still a minor and wouldn't end up in jail for ten years for it. 

It was so bad at home because of him that I would *gladly* have accepted some criminal youth program.

And I thought about it a lot when I was younger, that at least if I hurt him bad enough I'd get away from him and get the help I needed.

So yeah, my anger with him is an obsession, it latches on to even the most fleeting memory of something he's said or done, and I'm actually *shaking* because I'm restraining myself from doing something rash. A good day is when I don't think about him at all, that way the anger doesn't have fuel. But when I have down days it's absolutely futile to try to forget he exists, and the rage just swallows me whole.

I don't know what to do. I really don't, this anger is so consuming it leaves me exhausted and unable to do the most basic tasks. I walk around clenching my jaw and I can't relax until I take some at-need meds I have for anxiety, but all those do is calm my body, my mind is still raging and it's like a bad hangover the next day where the anger just comes back tenfold - repeat ad-infinitum. 

So I try to deal with it, but I have no clue how to go about that. I have talked about my anger with my psychologist but they haven't given me any tools on how to deal with it. I don't want to put a lid on it which is what I'm doing now, I try to talk myself down, saying he's not worth it, he's not worth going to prison for, I'm better than that, etc. 

But in those moments of anger the only thing I can think about is making him suffer. And it's having serious effects on my life, the slightest thing that reminds me of my brother just sets me off, and I don't want to explode on my friends or other family members for something they have no hand in. I just need help. I need to know how to calm down, I need to be able to try something to ease this.

I know talking with a psychologist about the root issue of the anger is a thing to do, and I have it on my list, but it's not something I can do right now, so please, how do I calm down? I've tried the breathing and the counting but all it ever does is enrage me more because I get pissed off that I need to do those sort of things over something *he's* done to me.

What else can I do?",1
"IDK if anyone else experiences this but. . . when someone gets close enough behind me on the toll road for me to examine their grill in my rear view and then pulls around me I get mad. Why? To that driver, I am being a serious problem. I am inconveniencing them. It especially irritates me when I am going over the speed limit already. I know everyone deserves the right to want to go 100 mph and do their best to get to that speed. At the same time, I hate being a problem to people. It makes me want to speed up so I won't be a problem to that truck that views the freeway as the American Autobahn. Sometimes, the left lane really is the most efficient way to get by slow traffic on the way to work. I will do 80-85 in the left lane. But I just can't do 100 so I sense the anger in the other driver mounting. Sometimes, they will move over to the lane to the right of me in a desperate attempt to get past me, only to get snarled behind a trailer. Then they get behind me again. I do my best to please the speedster but the fact that I am being a problem remains. At any rate, it's an instant anger trigger for me, especially when I am going 70 (not in the left lane) and they cut around me and and get in front of me like I am doing 20.",1
"This is my first post on here, hope i'm doing it right.

I'm a 19 y/o f and as unusual as it sounds, I get in a lot of fights. Every time I go out and drink, it's as if I have a death-wish. Yesterday a guy catcalled me and instead of just ignoring it, I asked him what his problem was and then it escalated into a fight. I'm not a good fighter, so I don't know what i'm trying to achieve here. It ended up with a bunch of dudes filming me and calling me El Chapo, instead of separating the fight. I just get so uncontrollably angry at the world and then the first sucker who pisses me off in the slightest is met with my ill humor. Point is, I woke up this morning, embarrassed as fuck, and I feel like the worst human ever. I haven't always been a violent person but I think my anxiety triggers it, I really don't know but yeah, I've been having these rage-outbursts for like 5 years now, and i'm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or has any advice.

Rather it be while im in classes or when im trying  to go to sleep and I get so angry like the person is right in front of me. I imagine braking them down   beating them to a pulp. I know I did the right thing by being the bigger man but why cant I move on ? I bet I couldn't even pick some of these people out in a line up but I can still remember how I felt.

"I'm 25 years old, out of college, with a full time job. Even though life is good, I'm angry at my family, friends, and everyone I associated with back in college. 

I'm angry because back when college classes were in swing, and grades were the most important thing in the world, everyone told me that working hard was the top priority. I was told to be diligent, focused, and never let my personal feelings or wants get in the way of the work. And I succeeded, everyone praised me for it. I'm more tired and angry than a 25 year old probably should be. I was praised for being this hard working machine, and I feel so empty because of it. What makes me truly angry, is that now because college is over... ***NOW*** everyone expects me to be this happy go lucky guy that makes fun and happiness a priority. 

Everyone expects me to start dating, going out on the town, having fun, being this fun guy that wasn't needed back when everyone wanted something from me. And that's the worst part. Why is being happy important **now** that the proclaimed ""*best years of my life*"" are over? And why do all the people that set all these high expectations expect me to be this fun loving person?

Now that all the school work is done, I'm supposed to shrug off all the work and stress that I went though by acting like a fun-loving socialite. If I did act happy, wouldn't that mean I justified all the stressful difficulties that other people imposed on me? Wouldn't I be justifying someone else's bad behavior and unrealistic expectations.

**I don't think there's a genuinely happy person in me... And even if there was, I don't think these selfish people deserve to see it.** 

Maybe my friends and family deserve to see me as this angry hard working machine. What if I stay like this for the rest of my life?

TLDR: I'm angry at friends and family who demanded so much from me, who are now expecting me to have fun and enjoy spending time with them.",1
"I started reading this book the other day on the train ride into work and today came across this under the subsection, Mindfulness of Anger. I thought this would be a good place to post it.

Personally I spend too much time looking for the arsonist and not focusing on putting the fire out.

This quote really hit home today and I hope that it truly changes my perspective on things and I hope it helps others here as well.",1
I had to punch something I just punched some plastic things. Fist is bruised in side. I hate that. After that I had a breakdown. Idk just the smallest inconvenience makes me freak out.

"So I'm usually pretty good at suppressing my anger (too good probably) but the past few weeks it's been different. Been lashing out at people, having to focus hard on not losing my shit, punching walls in private.


I'm thinking it might be because I stopped taking my anti-depressants + mood stabilizers, is that a common result? It could also be because I'm drinking too much again, another possibility would be that it's caused by my Kratom use (I've heard about opioids making some people angrier than usual). Any other possible causes?


Anyhow, what's a good middle ground between completely supressing it and not being able to contain it anymore? I think about the consequences of my actions a lot, so I tend to not voice my anger because it wouldn't do much. I mostly stay polite and friendly even when I feel a lot of anger, I just let them know that it makes me angry but don't show it. 

I don't understand why I'm losing my cool currently because there's nothing unusual happening in my life, really.

So yeah, any ideas?",1

I'm a 33/m and have struggled with my anger as long as I can remember. I have noticed that this past year it has gotten alot worse mainly due to extra stress but still I need to find a way to let it out in a positive way. I have had my anger effect not only my working life but also my relationships. I have had it cost me jobs and hinder my advancement at other jobs.

I wake up every morning with the thought process that I won't let things get to me so bad but then it happens either someone at work or another driver on the road. It used to be me just say my peace in a aggressive way (yelling and cussing) then just move on now it is getting to the point of physical altercation. I need to find an outlet of some sort I'm trying to get my finances straightened back out so I won't have to work all the time so I can try and find a support group around where I live (KY).

"About a month ago at my sister’s wedding, the officiate “shushed” me during rehearsal. I wasn’t being rude, just trying to clarify one of my sister’s requests and I got “shushed” in front of a lot of family and friends. I got angry, said “excuse me?!” (definitely in an aggressive tone), everyone got quiet and the groom just asked to move on. Afterwards, I went up to the officiate and calmly told her I didn’t appreciate being shushed. She said “oh brother. Let me do my job, I’m damn good at it”. I froze as I was not expecting a grown adult to react in such an immature way and she walked away. 

Now, a month later, I still think about it. I think it mostly just bothers me that I let someone be so blatantly rude to me and didn’t do anything about it. I’ve debated “pulling a Karen” and writing a review in hopes that’ll make me feel better and help me move on but I don’t want it to be tied to my sister at all.  I also don’t even know if that would help.

I seem to get this way a lot, especially when I feel like my self-respect and pride were damaged. How do I get myself to move on or what can I do in the moment to let it go and not let it affect my day?",1
"This is my first post in this sub, I'm not sure if it's the exact place for it but I figured it qualifies as anger. I was wondering if anyone who struggles with anger gets this from a lot of pent-up holding in of your frustrations. For example, if someone says something to me or does something that I find offensive or upsetting I tend to just eat it which causes smaller things to make me more angry. I know I should be more confrontational or assertive and not allow these things to stew but it's not easy.

"Hello, I took a week of vacation because my parents are up visiting me from Florida.  I am getting very angry because not only do I have a pinched nerve in my back causing me pain,I have also been unable to spend my day(s) off so far the way I have wanted.  I am either being asked to help move stuff for my sister, or hauled somewhere with the rest of the family and my sister is having my parents babysit my niece here during the day.  Every time I sit down to watch TV or something, she asks me to watch a movie then starts crying if I say no.  I am also being asked to use my computer because my mom's work laptop is having problems so I cannot use my computer when needed.  If I say something, like I want to drive separate to go somewhere (my parents always take the longest route, never let me drive) they will question it and never want to accept my authority.  I am ready to just ask them not to come next year because not being able to decide how I want to spend my vacation time is bothering me. I really do not feel like doing heavy lifting for moving because of my back, but also because it is my vacation and I want to relax.  I kind of just want to tell them this isn't working out and not do this again.  I have expressed this feeling before and my parents will just try to say I'm being unreasonable/a jerk. I started smoking again because it feels like the only way to avoid the stress.  I notice I am also getting very impatient about even the slightest inconveniences whether that's waiting at a stop light, waiting for someone to call me back or send me an email.",1
"I have a decent grip on my temper, but it gets explosive under stress (having fairly severe depression and anxiety doesn’t help). I’m usually a very chill and friendly guy but when I hit the tipping point, it gets ugly. So ugly that I’ve lost two jobs over it, and got suspended numerous times in school.

My father (long estranged, thankfully) also has a temper like mine. I’m not sure  if I got it from nature or nurture, but it’s a part of both of us. I want nothing more than to be a better man than him, and I fear nothing more than turning into him. 

When I blow up, I feel guilty/worthless/like a lost cause. It’s especially bad when I blow up at a friend or my SO, or if it wrecks a piece of my life (like losing my job). That’s when I get depressed, which drags down lots of other things (quality of work; no enthusiasm for my interests; self-medicating; occasionally attempted self-harm). I then get extra stressed out because my outlets either don’t help me relieve the pressure or they’re outright harmful. Eventually the stress builds until I snap and it begins again.

I’m tired of my explosive temper damaging my life and hurting people I care about, but I can’t afford therapy and my schedule is too erratic for a support group. I need advice, support, techniques, something. Please.",1

"Been looking for a new job for four months after graduating with a master’s in policy and bachelors in communications;  even though I’m still employed, I’m not getting paid as much, not getting enough work to do, and unsure if I want to stay employed in the marketing industry for the rest of my life.

The job hunt has been super frustrating all summer; Either I don’t get an interview or I get one but I find out that the employers are jerks, someone ‘more qualified’ gets the job, or they are people who insist they cannot pay me.

I end up feeling the most anger towards my mom, my grandfather, and my uncle.  They are good people and deserve better from me.  But I feel like they are micromanaging me and trying to push me to do things like check out a certain online course or go to a career event or (in grandfathers case) start reciting prayers to get a job everyday.

Maybe they aren’t micromanaging me - and maybe Im just one of those people that needs to suck up to the reality about job hunting - but when I think about my job hunt (especially with my mom, grandad or uncle) I get frustrated at failing to get a job and the effort I’ve put into it...my thoughts lose control and all I want to do is end the conversation.  I’ve noticed I’ve been losing my temper more and just want to isolate myself from the world.  Reading fictional books, meditation, and exercise have been thankfully helping me cope

 But my anger has gotten to the point where I can’t answer the phone immediately if it’s my uncle or grandfather.  All I can say without getting angry is ok.  Mom and I have also become
More prone to arguments 

Doing art (something I’ve always loved to do as a hobby) doesn’t calm me down at all anymore - and it’s especially frustrating because I kept wondering if I’ve made the wrong career choice or missed out on an opportunity somewhere.  And I also I hate feeling this way because initially I did art to make myself feel happy and connect with people like me  - I want it to make me happy again :(

And I just want to stop being angry with my family, especially the ones trying to help me

I want to stop feeling like I’m failure for not getting a job right now

I want to go back to enjoying my art projects without constant worrying if I will get a job or feeling like I want to get away from

Just wondered if anyone has any success stories whereby they've sought help for their anger issues and it has significantly helped them and made a difference to their life.

Would really benefit from hearing other people who have managed to become calmer and less reactive/irrational. Or any tips I could look at using in the meantime :) Thanks!,1

Sometimes when I think someone is being nasty to me or think they're moaning or blaming me about something I get angry to the point where I shake and lash out at the person and even if I walk away I'm constantly thinking about it and end up shouting to myself swearing out loud how can I stop getting that angry and just let go?,1
"I have few problems keeping my cool when people provoke me when the situation is bearable. By ""uncomfy"" situations, I mean situations that make me more irritable (after an exhausting day, being in unbearably hot and humid environment etc.). I am still able to keep my cool during the first 2-3h in this situation, but longer than that and I lose my cool more easily, especially when someone provokes me. I just feel like I wanna shelter myself from the world and please just leave me alone for now, I just wanna be at home reading books or studying or even just going to my college class listening to lecture (where the situation is so much more bearable).

So far, I've managed to apologise to the people who I may have made uncomfortable by my sudden raise in voice (that's typically all the thing I do to convey: ""Please just leave me alone for now"") and they have accepted them. However, I cannot just say this to my coworkers when I'm put in uncomfortable situations. It hasn't happened, but I'd like to prevent it from ever happening. I cannot avoid these situations at times.

I know that there are a lot of people who can maintain their calm outer appearances even in awkward situations where I will not be able to handle. They say that the very first step is realization of your mistakes, but what's the first step to reduce these occurrences?",1

"So I'm generally a mellow person with lots of love to give, but I realize I struggle with anger.


Two days ago at work I was filling out orders, talking to customers, and trying to keep up. I had 2 co-workers talking to me at the same time and I was unable to really listen to what was being said by one of them, I was focusing on what was being said for an order. 


One of the co-workers was talking about a girl who recently passed away during hurricane dorian. I accidentally told him ""what the fuck do I care about someone who died?""


It wasn't until later that I learned that girl(28ish) was that man's daughter. He agreed, what would I care and he moved on. Another co-worker told me that it was his daughter and my heart sank. I didn't realize who he was talking about and that he was just telling me about it. I later apologized about my disrespectful response and he said that it wasn't a big deal but I could tell he was trying to not make it a big deal. But that outburst(not yelling, but aggressive) was totally Inappropriate and I deeply regret it.


I want to make things right but these are one of those things I can't really take back. I said something horribly insensitive and I wish I didn't. I realized afterwards that I have anger issues and become inpatient quickly in a lot of circumstances.


I looked up a lot to george Carlin, Micheal McDonald, Marc Maron and other comedians known for angry outbursts. I've learned how to make things funnier, throwing in punchlines, and adding a wink to things I say in hopes that they are not super upsetting. But I realize now that the way I think and talk, I'll say something regrettable to a person I respect.


I am going to seek counseling for my anger issues but for now I just feel ashamed for the person I've become and recognize how my words really do affect others around me. I want to be a positive influence to people, and I like to think I am a lot of the time. Just not this time.",1

"TL;DR - I get irrationally angry when my expectations aren't met. I'm aware of it and know that my best option is to learn to adjust my response to things, however in the heat of the moment I lose grip on rationality.

Hi. I'd like suggestions please. I've always had issues with anger, as long as I can remember. My childhood was not a happy one. To make a long story short, I have parents that look great from the outside but are very emotionally abusive and I was always afraid of my father beating me, although I can't remember him doing so. I also don't remember much before about 8 years old. My parents have told me that I would run into the room yelling at them to stop fighting, when I was a young child. Zero recollection.

I've done ok for a couple of months, however I get triggered by certain things. Usually it's traffic, as I live in a relatively congested city and we get just about every type of driver here. I also get triggered by what I perceive as criticism, especially from women. Could be a mom issue from when I was growing up, that I haven't resolved yet. She is still subtly critical and plays the victim to manipulate. I'll be 49 in a few weeks and I realize that it's time I grew out of that stuff, and am willing to put in the work to do so. I've made progress.

Today I really got set off for some reason, and I'm having trouble pinpointing what the trigger was. I had to make it to a meeting at a certain time, and I was waiting for my clothes to dry. I ended up leaving just at the time I needed in order to make it to the meeting in time, however I was feeling tired and a little scatterbrained, and I ended up going to the wrong library. Not that big of a deal, wasn't an important meeting, just a social gathering. I started beating myself up over it though, and then getting pissed off at various convenient scapegoats. My friend that I live with, the dog of all things...

Usually with traffic it's when I'm in a hurry. If I leave early enough and I'm not in a hurry, I just drive slowly and let everyone fly by. It's when I'm trying to make time that I end up with a slow left-lane cruiser in front of me. That kicks in my ethical superiority complex, and all I can think about is ""they should move out of the way, it's the law, keep right except to pass"". Once I get a chance, I fly around them on the right and cut them off to ""teach them a lesson"". Reciting it all now, I see it for the petty childish response that it is. My challenge is to reign in the anger when the adrenaline surges, and have a reasonable, mature response in the heat of the moment. Yes, it's human to get frustrated. The way I respond is very irrational, however, and sometimes dangerous. What if I caused an accident over my selfish behavior?

In relationships with women, I'm sensitive to any criticism. ""Why are you doing that? That's odd"" or ""I've never seen anybody put so much effort into something that should be so simple"" are a couple of examples. They were for small things, however I felt very disrespected and wasn't able to set boundaries in a healthy manner, because of my emotionally immature response. Instead of leaving it as their problem, and simply letting them know I'm uncomfortable with the way they're talking to me, I get pissed off and start sulking, usually restraining the urge to blow up and yell at them with the worst insults I can think of, to ""put them in their place"" or ""give them a taste of their own medicine"".

Today, I ran late because I screwed around on my phone for too long. I was trying to do something on Instagram and another app kept getting an error, so I did some troubleshooting to try and fix it. That get me started later on my laundry than I planned, and I ended up leaving the house later than I wanted. So I know the problem is me, I'll be better off if I quit screwing around with my phone when things need to get done.

So then I'm frustrated with myself already, and trying to drive fast to get to the meeting on time. It's only about 15 miles away, so even there was no traffic and I drove 100mph, I would only save a few minutes. Not worth the wear on my car and putting others in danger. That is not at the forefront of my mind, however. My focus ends up being along the lines of ""Why the hell are these people driving like such idiots?"" I become entitled and self-centered. If I'm going fast in the left lane and someone moves over in front of me and doesn't go fast enough, I get mad at them. I take it personally, and want to get in front of them and slow down, to make them ""see how it feels"" to have that done to them. And don't let someone sit a few seconds too long when the light turns green! Ugh. I need help.

My progress is that I accept now that it's me. For years I was convinced that I just needed to be around more competent people. Needless to say, I was often disappointed. I liken it to standing in the ocean just off the beach with my arms stretched out, trying to stop the waves. It's just not going to happen, it is much much bigger than anything I can control or change. In the last few years it has started to sink in that it's -my response- that I can change. Someone cut me off? Ok, I lose a few minutes of travel time. Is that few minutes worth what it does to my health when I get all worked up and stressed out? It definitely is not worth hurting or killing someone because I'm driving aggressively. I've lost jobs in the past and driven people away from me at work, where nobody wanted to work with me. I've gotten better, I recently had a frustrating time at work however I was able to talk to my manager and take a week off and regroup, and I came back with a much better attitude. I even got promoted shortly afterwards. 

What can I do when I get wound up that badly? Some things that I can think of are:

\- Just stop and step away from the situation. If people aren't doing what I think they should, then I can just remove myself from the situation (stop the car and close my eyes with some relaxing music, maybe), and get into a better frame of mind.

\- Learn to better anticipate that I may be triggered easily. If I'm feeling frustrated already about something not going right, I think if I can just say to myself ""This might not go right. That happens sometimes. It's ok. That's life. I'm going to be late/Not going to finish this project on time/Going to have to deal with a difficult co-worker/whatever else crosses my path at the wrong time.

The biggest challenge is when I don't catch myself in time, and end up strongly compelled to act like a child throwing a temper tantrum. Does anyone have any suggestions on, when figuratively the avalanche has started, the freight train has lost its brakes, what can be done to minimize the damage? I'm guessing maybe a less toxic outlet. Yell and scream in my car, cuss, whatever to vent the frustration, but don't drive dangerously. 

If I'm at work or with someone that does or says something that sets me off, maybe just close my eyes and breathe deeply, and tell them I suddenly don't feel good, which is true. If they press me about it, just say my chest is tightening up or my head started hurting or stomach feels sick. That may buy me some time so I can respond in a respectful manner and not tear their head off.

If you made it this far, thank you so much for listening. All day I've been thinking about who to vent to, and I have friends who would understand, and do give good advice about this stuff, but I had so much on my mind that I didn't want to vomit this stuff all over them. This was kind of like journaling. Just getting the thoughts out of my head and onto Reddit has been therapeutic. It also did a good job of putting it in perspective, as I could see it in front of me and see it for what it is, and it made it much more difficult to justify my behavior.

I hope you all have a great day.",1
Whenever I get angry I get a very strong urge to punch and/or break something. Doing this satisfies me and then I’m not angry anymore. But if I don’t then I just continue to be pissed off. I need something that I can throw hands at when I’m pissed. Does anyone have any ideas?,1

Thankfully I haven’t blown up at someone but it’s irritating.",1
"I don’t enjoy going to the doctor, at all. I never have because I hate hearing bad shit and I’d just rather not even know. So I haven’t gone to the doctor to be diagnosed for anything I’m about to speak on. I’m not sure if I’m bipolar, I have anger management issues or whatever else may cause my feelings/actions. The first time I experienced going to the doctor to be diagnosed, it was in 4th grade, my mom took me in for some bullshit test and the doctor said I had ADHD and ADD. At the time, I didn’t realize how fucking stupid that was... I was a kid. I talked in class and didn’t pay attention because school didn’t interest me and OH, cause I was a kid. My school treated me SO differently when people found out, teachers would constantly ask me “Did you take your medicine this morning?” (In front of the whole class) and the school said I absolutely had to join this class to go to for help with work. It was called CM for “slow learners” to go to and 4 teachers would be in there helping the students in that classroom with their work. I remember the first time I walked in that classroom, I was so fucking angry... every person in that room was autistic and a couple special ed (no I’m serious they were) and there were a select few that just... didn’t really care for school, and that was just it. I didn’t feel like I belonged in there but every single class I had, the teacher would teach their lesson and give us work... once I got my work they would say “Emery, do you want to go to CM?” (In front of the whole class, again) And I would say no and that I don’t need it. They would always end up making me and I would literally never go, I’d just walking the halls till I got in trouble. I remember as well, my mom and teachers had a parent &amp; teacher conference. I was in the room with them as they talked about my grades and how I fail to pay attention (this was high school now). I just hated school, I didn’t have the attention span to learn about things that didn’t interest me and I didn’t enjoy reading things I didn’t find interesting. They were all in the room, just talking about me as if I wasn’t even there. My principal, looked at my mom and asked right in front of me “Do you think your daughter may be special ed?” I looked up with the most ‘what the fuck’ face and everyone looked at me. My mom laughed? She fucking laughed and said “No, I don’t, she just has a hard time paying attention in school.” After that, I got up and left, I told my mom I was going to go wait in the car and that I’m not going back to class. I graduated school, I ended up wanting to go to a school to get my diploma faster because I was always bullied by not even just students but teachers, too. That was the best thing I ever did, graduating a year early.

The second time I went to a doctor to hear something I didn’t like, was when I was 22... I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, look it up.... the symptoms are ridiculous and I have quite a few of them. Hormonal changes are a very big factor that it’s played, upon many others. My husband and I have had trouble having children, when I see another friend or someone I know announce their pregnancy.... I get so upset. I scream, I cry and that’s when I really start just hating myself and feel like I’m useless.  

Ever since I can remember, I’ve had anger issues like you really wouldn’t believe. I get so angry at certain things that happen, like I’ll accidentally knock a glass over and I will absolutely RAGE and punch things or slam doors, I want to BREAK shit. I used to, when growing up, be so angry with myself that I would punch my legs until I couldn’t take it or punch brick... it had to be brick, I wanted to feel it and I wanted it to hurt. I do not hurt myself anymore, I haven’t since I was about 20 and I’m 26 now. I have had suicide thoughts since I was a child in middle school, I still often think of suicide and how much I hate myself/being alive. I just don’t want to be here. I have just one gun in my house for protection, sometimes I see it and stare at it just thinking “I really could just end it all right now” but I never would, I’m way too pussy for suicide but I still think about it... almost daily.  This has always been so hard for me to talk about because it scares me, because I don’t know why I’m like this and I don’t like it. I’m crying and just stressed as I’m typing this but I really need to get it out. 

I feel like when I get angry, I feel my whole body heating up and just boiling. I feel like and try so hard to just swallow it and count to 10 but half the time it will end up coming out. I feel like sometimes I have no self control of my actions/emotions when I know I do but I can’t help myself... it’s like in that moment I see red and I want to get it ALL out. 

Usually after, I abuse marijuana... I use it to calm me down, make me get in a better mood and it helps me with my depression. I smoked every single day, several times a day for 3 years because I wanted to feel better and happier. It not healthy, my husband hates that I smoke for those reasons and can’t deal with it on my own. I don’t smoke now as much as I did, when I do he’s not very happy about it and I tend to try and hide it from him a lot. I don’t like doing that but I feel now that I NEED marijuana just to stabilize myself and my mind. 

I need help, I know I do but I don’t even know where to start... I’m scared I’m going to go and hear something I don’t want to hear again... I’m fucking terrified. 

EDIT: I have yet and forgot to mention, my father also has depression, anxiety and anger issues. My parents had me extremely young, they were 16 and 17. I can remember like it was just yesterday when they got their first real place together. I know most people don’t remember things when their 3, 4 or 5 years old but the only thing I do remember is how often my parents fought and how incredibly angry and violent my father would get. My husband and I have been married 8 years... our first 3 years was nothing but fighting (thank God no kids around) and I would so quickly realize that when we would fight... I would turn into my father. I would break things, I would hurt myself to make my husband feel bad, I would scream and just cry. It took us almost divorcing for me to realize that I have to change or I will lose my husband who I so deeply just love more than anything. We haven’t fought like that in years, neither has my father with my mother because he literally has to be on medication to not act out. I, on the other hand, don’t sound like it but I have more control of it than my father. My parents fought pretty hard till I was about 20, it fucked me up I think, I think it made me think the fighting in a marriage was normal? 

My father has always had anger episodes and I was always there, ever since I was a young girl, to see them first hand. I truly think it’s something I got from him and developed just watching and hearing him. I’ve never talked to him about this, he would feel like complete and utter shit. He’s better now in a sense, his episodes are NOT as insane as they used to be. He has very small outbursts every once in awhile even on medication, but he’s been coping with it well and works his ass off to keep busy and from it taking over his life. I try to do the same, minus medication cause I don’t trust it.... I just feel like I’m not busy enough and I try to fill my time but there is only so much I can do and my anxiety really doesn’t help when I would like to get out of the house but I don’t have the drive to.",1
"I am generally a nice and understanding person, kind, gentle, I don’t bother or bully people I’m generally kept myself and it’s really hard to make me angry generally speaking. The only thing that really gets me explosive is when any harm is done to my wife. Sexually, physically, mentally. You do anything to her I don’t hesitate to murder you. When I say this I say it literally, I have such huge impulses, it’s like that part of my brain where I think rationally turns off and I don’t even think about consequences. I don’t care that I stab you or beat you till near death I do NOT FUCKING care.. I really don’t, anyone even dares to touch her will get punched. I’m SERIOUSLY explosive about this. She’s not in a good surrounding either.. Am I dangerous???",1
"When I get angry, it typically clouds my judgement just enough to make a wrong decision. I'll remain fairly reasonable, but when I'm angry, I *want* to pick the unreasonable option. Just today, I got fed up and I shouted and my girlfriend and her friend. Please note, when I lash out, it's never physically, but doesn't mean what I'm doing isn't bad. Every time I lash out, I regret it immensely afterwards. This time I felt especially bad, because my girlfriend is the person I care most about, and I never want to see her get hurt. She also has some past trauma that makes her shut down when shouted at, so I felt really bad for that too. She tried to assure me that everything was okay, that it's okay that I struggle with anger issues, but any time I lash out, I always feel like an irredeemable piece of garbage. I don't feel like I'm worthy of forgiveness. Just because I feel remorse, that doesn't mean I'm a good person. I guess what I'm doing here is wondering how I can get out of this mindset, and trying to find reassurance that I'm not an awful, abusive piece of shit. If more details are needed to make that judgement, that's fine.",1
"( Long post) 

17M here, 
I'll just provide some information and some questions that I'd appreciate to be answered. 

When I was as young as 7 I would from time to time bully kids that were rude to me. 

Age 13/14 I got in school fights. 

When I was in yr10 at age 14 I basically fucked up and looked like a big joke to everyone in my year, and was relentlessly bullied / ridiculed by 2/3 of the kids in my year level.  A year afterwards I turned to drugs for comfort. 

Fast forward to now and I have quite bad paranoia and anxiety issues (I take medication for insomnia) and I find that my anxiety always fuels my anger and rage.

I attend schooling in a new school in the city after being kicked out of my old school and almost charged for choking out a guy. 

Going to school in the city certainly hasn't helped with this problem. I'll yell at people or verbally disrespect them for slow walking, staring at me, getting in my way, etc. When I see people that look a certain way my adrenaline pumps and I get filled with ideas of fighting them, and I get extreme urges to engage in violence. 

It's beyond the point of just a teenage anger thing, and I need to learn how to control it, but I feel like it fits my profile and lifestyle.

Sometimes these angers get out of control, I've had breakdowns of wandering the streets hyperventilating, yelling at strangers, and I know I look straight up insane. Even typing this now I feel hatred and anger inside of me that just begs me to flatten anyone deserving of it. 

Having a girlfriend helps, but also doesn't. I never mistreat her in any way, verbally or physically and she really switches my soft side. But this changes when it comes to people staring at her in public, or guys harassing her or texting her trying to chat her up. Sometimes I get extreme urges to come down to her school and beat the living shit out of some of the scum that go there, hospitalise them, maybe even stab them, my anger feels like it doesn't have limits. 

I've also taken rage out on my self, I used to self harm by cutting, burning myself and now I'll still punch myself in the head on a daily basis when frustrated. 

I know this shit is really bad and it's sounding even worse to me now that I write it down, but it's driving me nuts inside and I just can't keep living like this. 

My questions are:

How bad is this from 1-10?

What are good strategies for calming down? 

Should I see an anger specialist / therapist? 

All responses are appreciated, and it means a lot if you read this far even if just to lurk, sending good luck to all of you.",1
"Well, as I’m sure it’s been said, I grew up in a very hostile and angry household. I’m 31 now, but I distanced myself from that as soon as I could as a young adult. I work on an ER now and the job is pretty damn stressful. People who need help that don’t want help. People who take up a bed just drug seeking. People swinging on me, yelling at me. I keep my calm for the most part. 

What gets me is my coworkers. Specifically the female ones. All the underhanded passive aggressive comments. The gas lighting. 

I confronted one one specific coworker today. She took a jab at me like she does literally every time I see her. I always ignore her, but she got to me today. I was already stressed from work. I asked her “What the fuck is wrong with you?” In definitely a raised tone. I didn’t yell or scream or anything, but I made myself known.  

I couldn’t let it go anymore guys. I felt like I needed to defend myself. It’s to the point now where when I see her, I kind of emotionally flinch because I know the jab is coming. 

Now it’s a huge email chain with all of our bosses. Her accusing me of screaming. She’s lying and making up things I never said. I left it at “I don’t want animosity in the work place. I don’t want to be harassed. I just want to do my job and help patients.” 

I feel like if I had a better control of my temper, I would have kept my cool. I don’t know. 

What do you guys think? 

A bit of me is worried I’ll get reprimanded for my outburst. There’s tentative plans to sit us both down and talk things out. I just don’t want to be messed with all the time.",1
"My dad and I struggled tremendously throughout our relationship. After my mum died he and I suffered at each other’s hands. The way he treated me when I tried to depend on him made me feel worthless. I fell into intense bouts of suicidal depression and for years repeated patterns of behaviour learned from him and repeating aspects of how I felt about him to other people.

At 24 I feel hardly like a man. I feel like a child. It’s too late to blame him and he has apologised for his past actions. As part of a spiritual experience I felt I was experiencing I made a lot of effort to do what I thought was helping him, taking him to get seaweed for his garden and taking him to see his childhood home. I did these things in the name of ‘growing up’ but soon found that spiritual experience not to be what I thought it was.

I am currently re-experiencing much of the anger from my past. I am having many thoughts about the way he has wronged me, despite trying to rationalise to myself that it is petty to try and cling to reasons to not let go. Admittedly, the scared child in me does not want his dad to die, and while I know it is something I will have to accept, I don’t want to repeat Stockholm like behaviour. I want to lay this chapter to rest.

I still blame him for a lot of my current predicaments even though there is not much he can do about it. He suffers from a lot of guilt as it is. Part of me is still just so damn angry though. It’s not a path I want to embrace.",1
"I had a very angry father, who gave me an example at a young age to be quick to anger, and be violent and hot headed. It is very much like a disability, as that is all I know how to do. It makes me feel very powerless. I at least need a way to make my fuse longer, because right now it is VERY short. I get mad at mundane things and become irrationally angry. I remember fights I got into many months ago and still get mad about them, and become very violent. I just want to at least have a longer fuse so I don't keep saying and doing things that I regret later.",1
"So, I do have some experience with this concept. I have actually watched a few videos on YouTube, talking about how anger is an emotion that is a cover-up feeling to defend from the powerless feeling of violation, but I never thought that I would be privy to it. (famous fucking last words) 

Recently, I've noticed that a lot of my own anger -- and I'm talking about that juicy, white-hot, hypertensive resentment -- comes from a place of feeling violated. 
And I mean that in the general, figurative sense, like a value, boundary or moral is violated, 
but I have noticed as well that -- despite never having been sexually assaulted or mistreated in any way -- I get a boiling sense of emasculation whenever my mother tries to touch me or ""helicopter"" me around in one thing or another. 

As a person who has a clingy, oedipal, elicopter parent, I'm often invalidated for my frustrations with this, and told that I should just appreciate her because she loves me so much, and unfortunately for both these hippie-types, and me, all it's really done is caused me to try and bypass, overlook and not truly process any feelings of violation. This has not boded well for my health, and psychological wellbeing. 

Does anyone have any tips/wanna commiserate over similar experiences?",1
I have a serious un-diagnosed anger problem and i just put my hand through a lot of wooden stuff on my desk. I'm relatively skinny I don't know how I did it. My right hand is VERY cut up.,1
"I’m so sick of my sister. Every time we talk about something that I care about or get into she tells me that “I don’t need your attitude right” as if she’s a fucking person of authority. Spoilers: she’s not and she’s just as attitude fulled as me.

She always acts like I’m being mean or getting angry when we talk about fascinating stuff because I get really get into what I’m saying and sound passionate about it. I’m not mean. I don’t yell at her. I try not to interrupt her even though she always, and I mean every conversation always, talks over me. If I actually lose my temper I leave, I don’t sit there anymore and try to talk when I’m mad because I know I don’t make sense.
She doesn’t try to walk away, she gets nasty. She brings up personal stuff that has nothing to do with what we’re talking about. She acts like a bitchy child that you wanna leave on the side of the road but can’t because you’d feel bad even though she’s not worth it. She does this so she can feel like she’s right and that she’s on top, but she’s not because she’s just as dumb as me.

I just get so pissed with her. I know that I don’t know what she’s thinking and I don’t know how she feels. I do know that she’s the most sensitive person to get offended by nothing. You could tell her that she has lipstick on her teeth and she’d take it as a personal attack. I don’t know why I bother talking to her, why I think she’ll be different or something.",1
"I am not trying to fix boyfriend's problems because I know I can't on my own. It's foolish to be the therapist when I'm not qualified. So I suggest solutions that he might use and leave it up to him to listen or take these up.

However, since no partner should be a therapist, then to what extent is helping them get through their problems acceptable? There are a lot of compromises and boundary protecting measures. Some people have helped their partners in their anger issues which is great, but how do you know that you're not playing the therapist?",1

"My anger is getting worse &amp; the toll it's taking on my boyfriend has gone from small bickers to him outright calling me mentally abusive which I think - no cross that, KNOW-  he is right, when he looked up the cycles the way my anger works ties in with it almost perfectly &amp; I feel absolutely sick to my stomach &amp; every time I get angry I honest to God FUCKING HAAAATE IT.
I hate how I get angry, I hate how I can consciously see out of my own eyes but my mouth feels connected to a completely different person. That the smallest minor thing will set me off &amp; if it slightly resembles something that's upset me previously I'll blow up &amp; say things I instantly regret &amp; don't mean but my pride &amp; the anger won't let me instantly apologize.
I just I don't know where to go or where to look, everyone has help for the victim &amp; I hate that now he technically (well no, not even technically anymore) is one because I haven't been able to grasp control of it. 
But everything I look up just shuns the abuser &amp; doesn't offer help &amp; I just. 
Reddit I need help. 
I don't want him to leave me or cut me out of his life, but I feel he may have to for his own sake even though that's the last possible thing I could ever want. I just want him to be happy, &amp; I know I'm not helping him be that &amp; it breaks my heart a little more each time. 
 Even though I love him so much but the person I am now to when we had started I'm ashamed of. I never thought I would become this &amp; I'm actually worse than the nightmares I had fearing the monster I could be become.
I need help. I'm sobbing as I write this because I never thought I could become this bad. Every time I become angry I hate it. It's my least favorite emotion &amp; the one I have the least control over no matter how badly I try to grasp at that control it's like trying to have control over it almost makes it worse. 

Edit: spelling.",1
"Just like the title when I get really mad and have no control over myself I throw things. My father used to do this and I hated it then now I am repeating the same thing. My upbringing wasn’t the best. Both my father and mom were abusive in many different ways, but I don't wanna use this as an excuse. I just think this could be one of the biggest factors of me being unstable. The problem is tho, my anger management issue gets the rock bottom when I fight with my younger sister who shared this horrible childhood with me. I feel really worthless when this happens and kind of want to take my own life. What do I do?",1
"I think of the future as unmanageable. I think of the past as something to despise or else grieve. I think of the present never.

I will change my current standards or views in a second if it means I get to hate on somone.

What does hate give me?",1
"I've been told all my life to calm down, and let me just say that I was mentally healthier when I didn't care about looking like a fool while angry or whom I hurt. I rationally know why it's taboo, but when I'm angry, I wish it weren't. I wouldn't wish ever having to hold in their feelings for any reason on anyone, and it's worse when it's actually justified.",1
"I hope this is the right place to put this, throwaway for obvious reasons.

Last night I got pushed over my limit. I don't know how, I was playing a video game, somewhat competitive, shooter. I've been playing for a year and a half or so and I still see myself doing god awful. consistently awful. spend 2-3 hours doing nothing but getting shit on and losing. I've put time into trying to learn how to get better, following advice of friends who are good, aim training, watching pros, and I still suck. it's not just video games, it seems to be anything with some sort of learning curve. It got to the point where I got pushed over my limit, blood pressure exceeded where it should have, I got up, clenched my fists, almost blew my forehead vein out by pushing out but holding my breath (idk if I even described that right), and ended up punching my desk, and then my bed a few times, ending my rage with pulling my belt out and hitting my back with it (I swear typing this out makes it seem far weirder than it was). I don't get these angry/rage fits often. I have only had about 3 or 4 in the past 2 years, the previous times were from school work, same thing, trying to learn, spend a few hours doing something, but can't seem to get it right. After the rage fit I thought about how much of a failure I am and that no matter how long I practice, no matter how much attention I give something, I still can't get it right.  I don't like getting into that rage. I don't like what happens during that period of time. I don't like being that kind of person. It really hit me afterwards when my SO got up and was about to leave because I scared them. It's time to do something about it. not too long after, maybe 10, 20 minutes, it's like it didn't even happen (to me). SO still scared, still unsure of what's going on with me, but to me, it's like nothing happened. What the fuck is wrong with me? how the fuck do I prevent this from happening? 

this is entirely a me vs me conflict. I \*\*NEVER\*\* would hurt my SO, or anyone else for that matter. 100% me fighting me.",1
"Hi idek how I'll type this because my hands and body is shaking from anger and my head feels light my breathing is shallow and I feel like going mad.
 
Please give some time and read my recent post about what I'm going through. Basically the part about my younger brother I mentioned there. He is a 13 year old junk. He jerks off every day, he is obese, he showers once a week, smells of piss, sits on his ass playing ps4 24/7. Apart from that now I'm almost 18....UGHHH IM TRYING SO HARD TO EXPLAIN THIS IN A CALM WAY BUT MY THOUGHTS ARE JUMBLED UP BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME ANGER I AM HOLDING INSIDE. So I'm almost 18 and my room has an air con and his doesn't, he brings his mattress in my room every night to sleep. His tablets volume is on 100 and even when I complain about it to my abusive parents they don't do anything. Apart from that he would randomly curse at me calling me a bitch whore....should I go on?. I want to die honestly. My privacy is evaded by this junk, my personal space is evaded, my so called parents don't give a damn.

From my last post you might read, he complained about me talking on the phone at night loudly when I was literally whispering to my boyfriend and from there the abuse from my narc mother started......ive been holding this anger inside since the morning I've only got a little out by cutting myself on my legs. It helps haha. There is so much going in in life, I'd appreciate if you could read my recent and understand where I'm coming from because I really can't type anymore. Sorry.

All I need is advice. Tell me how do I finally let go and run towards him and shred him to pieces,punch him slap him kick him and make him bleed  how do finally let go and break everything in the kitchen, why am I such a loser, why can't I get my anger out like that and GAIN RESPECT AND POWER THAT I DESERVE. HOW DO I GET MY ANGER OUT LIKE THAT HOW DO I FINALLY GO MAD AND CRAZY AND GET IT OUT, HOW DO I STOP HOLDING MYSELF BACK AND NOT GIVING A F ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES HELP ME I FEEL LIKE IM ABOUT TO FAINT.",1
"In a nutshell, a while back in January I was in the classic situation of best friend getting with the girl I liked.

The full story is I was in a sticky situation with this girl; she was toxic and abusive which I thankfully realised now and she was taking something out on me and one of the ways she did that was getting together with my best friend at the time.

It sounds petty on a surface level but what annoys me is a lot of things

1. She accused me of trying to use her as ""second best"" because I didn't get back together with my ex when everyone thought we would (was my choice) yet this guy did exactly that; he didn't hook up with who he wanted so this girl was his backup. And he had a huge go at me for it when he knows full well it's in fact what he was doing

2. He didn't feel bad about it at all. His ""Apology"" was half assed at best

3. He knew it'd hurt me and did it anyway

4. He knew she was treating me horribly but didn't stick up for me at all

5. He knew I was suicidal because of other stuff too and he just told me to ""Get over it, go talk to someone""

6. Pretty sure he's lied to others about me like she did

7. He's a sleazy piece of shit who cheats on partners and just wants to sleep with everyone and is super creepy about it, it actually disgusts me.

It keeps coming in waves I guess is how I'd describe it. Every now and then I'm reminded of what he did and I'm livid. I feel like punching something so I find a pillow or punchbag and use it but honestly? Not a day goes by where it doesn't cross my mind and because I don't really have an outlet for my anger, I'm worried it's going to come out in an unhealthy way and I'll say something stupid or hit him or something, I don't know. 

If anyone has any advice on how to process it &amp; come to terms better or any outlets I could find for it, I'd appreciate it",1
"Got into a argument with my supervisor tongiht over some side work and stupid stuff .

and now I get to enjoy the anxiety of knowing me him and are exec chef are all gonna have nice sit down talk about it tomorrow. I still don't feel I was in the wrong but i hate having do sit down talks and defend myself honestly I'm tired of the way im reacting to this situations to and i could def  handle it better

really thinking its time for me get out the kitchen industry :( fucking hate having trouble letting this go",1
"He can’t control his anger. The police were called to my apartment today because neighbors were concerned with yelling. He goes on screaming rages, it’s happened a lot before so I’m surprised no one has called before.  The cops were nice and just left when I told them everything was okay. 
But this did not serve as a wake up call to gain self control. He explodes at any little thing or any little thing I say or do. I can see him writhing with anger as it builds up and he can’t help but be loud or slam doors or hit things, etc. 

An argument got out of hand that made him start going to anger management a few months ago. He loves it and loves going but I think when the 2 hours are over it’s like he was never there. 
I am also pregnant and can’t handle the explosions anymore. 

What can I do?",1
"If your anger tends to have some abusive outcomes, then do you recognise yourself as abusive? *Are* you abusive? Have you tried to do anything about it and has it worked? What did it take?

Or: did you use to have anger management issues that you have solved, meaning you are ready to be in an adult relationship?",1
"If she per accident gives a tiny spoiler about a movie or game, I can get pissed at her. Or if I can't understand what she's saying, I get irritated towards her. But also if she makes a somewhat bigger mistake, I get completely angry at her and blame her for everything and say terrible stuff.

I want to fix this so bad. However she doesn't stand up for herself. That lets me know I can get mad at her without anything bad happening, leading up to me being mad at her. I just can't control myself in these situations.",1

"Alright guys and girls. I used to post all this on r/abusiverelationships but I think I need the story from the other side. Just to be clear, nothing clearly abusive has happened yet, and if there has been anything pushing my boundaries, it hasn't happened again after I said stop. Anyways:

He promised to get help for his explosive anger issues so he should be doing that within the next two weeks (which I understand is already ASAP as he can). He has not exploded violently at me ever, but he does unleash violence at other people. Just bullies which he has been dealing with for many many years. The main thing I am concerned about is whether or not he will end up reacting violently to me.

It is best that I step away, but as he has not tried to hurt me I think he should have a chance. There are however some things I am confused about that I hope you reader can help with:

* I think he lacks any empathy for the bullies he assaults and feels good about the action of punching them. He seems to be aware that it makes him an asshole and it will not help him find any jobs in the long run. However he sees violence as a legitimate solution since they leave him alone after that.
* He says he'll tell the counsellor ""I want to stop hurting people"", but I'm not sure if this is just to satisfy me since he feels good hurting people who hurt him. As for the secondary leaving certificate course he is entering (and I am already in) he sees that he has to really control his behaviour if he wants to stay in that course. But then again, I don't think he really sees how much of a problem it really is.
* For some reason he does not lash out at teachers, parents or other adults even if they anger him. He will rant about it to me.
* I hate his raising his voice because that's what my mother does before she starts to verbally abuse me. I also hate seeing him swearing. But when he is angry he will shout and swear, and I do tell him to stop (which he does after I give him a cooldown) but the next time he is angry it will happen again. Some people say this constitutes as abuse, some don't think so. I am unsure.
* Somehow he thinks his ranting hurts me. It doesn't because I understand that ranting helps people cool down. So he thinks that because of this he is abusive. The issue is just the shouting and swearing.
* **I'm not sure if forcing him to look for anger management is a solution. In some cases, therapy only works if you see that you really have to change. If he does not see the gravity of his own problems I think he won't get any better. Even having forced him into therapy.**
* He said that he doesn't think he will hurt me, and he has not tried to. But given his problems there is always a chance that he may. I wonder if any of you can give insight on this.
* Do any of you think that there's anything that sets you apart from an abuser in a relationship? And if so why?

Thanks. Would appreciate help.",1
"I've been trying to get good at drawing, and I can't even draw fucking eyes in correct proportions, I keep getting so fucking pissed off and start hitting my drawing tablet or bashing my hands against my skull.

How the hell do I stop getting pissed off at such a small fucking thing?",1
I always find myself mad at something everyday. I have really bad anger issues and even something that might not seem that big to the normal person would get me furious. When i get mad i just start tearing up and clenching my fists and holding my head. I want to know if there are any methods of how to deal with anger that i should try that have worked for you guys.,1
"So I've been trying to work on my own anger issues for a bit now, a lot of times failing moreso than succeeding...and I've noticed a pattern with my whole behavior on how/why I get angry: I seem to seek out things, whether political or otherwise, that will stir my anger up, and then I'll keep looking for more and more things, until finally my rage is in full effect. I realized that its not even really a conscious thing, I tend to just do it and stir myself up over trivial shit...and its my own fault, because I seek that kind of stuff. What the hell is wrong with me? Do I have an ADDICTION to anger?! I caught myself today and was asking myself ""what the hell is going on here? WHY Am I doing this without any real reason?"" and had to pinch myself HARD to stop myself.

"Ok, I feel sometimes anger, but not so much, I am a person quite capable to manage my anger.

But I live with my husband, who had difficult childhood and a lot of anger hidden away..

He can manage to control this.. but sometimes.. there is this great big ball of energy that just pops out..

I can relate it to the dragon story...

There was this boy...a very sweet and soft boy...who liked playing with his toys...
But.. now and then.. somethinh happened, and inside he felt he was changing..
He was changing into a DRAGON.. and as he changed into a dragon, he could less and less understand the words people were, lovingly, or not lovingly , saying to him..
Because.. little boys understand human language.. but dragons.. they only understand dragon language!
And when he was a full dragon.. he does what dragons do.. kick and destroy and spit fire to everything that is near, and once loved...
Untill the moment their was no energy left...then the dragon slowly dissapeared, and the little boy showed up, once again.. to see the path of destruction the dragon caused.. maybe his favorite toys would be broken, maybe his most beloved mom would be hurt..
Maybe some glue would be enough, and a kiss and cuddle to his mom
But maybe the toy was forever broken and the beloved one would have a scar...



This is my question.. what do I do, when my husband becomes the dragon.. 
Am I the favorite toy..
Is glue enough
Will I , perhaps once, be broken forever..


I put this here, because a lot of people understand anger here, I feel their is less judgement for people staying with angry people and not giving up..
In relationship topic abuse us a quicky spoken word, and yes, in some kind of way..it is abuse..

But I am loving, gentle and forgiving, and very understanding..
I do also want to take care of myself and make healthy decisions for myself...

Angry people..how do you wish to be approached when angry and after? Any tips, advice, to keep loved once safe..
Which actions help with anger management..
Anything that is helpfull is welcome..

TLDR .. sorry, not possible to give a summary ...",1
"I don't really post on reddit at all but I've been having trouble recently so I thought I'd give it a shot posting here. I've always been angry, the kind that's wayyy deep down, so far down my closest friends and family have never even heard me raise my voice or even physically lash out in anyway. I'm angry at the world for being so awful, I'm angry at people for not caring, I'm angry at myself because I thought the reason I haven't done anything with my life is because I didn't want to be a part of this world but recently I'm starting to think I've been wrong. The real reason I haven't done anything with my life is because I don't want to do anything of those things. I've always looked at people kind of like ""meat"", they mean next to nothing until they speak or act, I'm seeing more and more meat doing terrible things, and getting away with it. Not just getting away with it, but protected by those in positions of power, when it's obvious they deserve to be brought to justice for what they did. Now I'm thinking justice isn't done by institutions, it's not done by lawyers, cops, judges, prisons etc. So shouldn't it be done by someone willing to take on all that darkness themselves? Someone who can control it as they bring retribution to those who have been released by the same system we trust to protect and serve? I don't know if someone who kills someone else deserves to die themselves, I suppose circumstances matter a lot, but some meat is obviously rotten and leaving it out in the world will only spoil what's left. I'm sorry if this seems ranty and ravy (not words i know) but I just needed somewhere to get my thoughts down.

"At work I deal with machines that are automated to make parts themselves, which my job is to watch them and make sure they run right and check the parts they make. I work the night shift so there is more of a chance for me to be pissed off. Here I couldnt go on a break since I had to get the parts put on a reel. Any slight bend, smudge or grease from fingers on them automatically voids them to be bad. So I was putting the parts on a reel and constantly one thing after another the machine would shut off while I am holding the parts up with a pair of gloves on. And I had nobody to help me. I took a piece of tape and taped the parts to the side of the reel until I could figure it out. I must've had to fix the issue over 100 times within an hour alone. And I eventually outbursted and slammed the door as hard as I could without realizing it. Since then my coworkers have been murmuring to each other while looking right at me. This has happened so many times before. I have no idea how to handle it or control it. The moment I think I'm getting better it happens to me again where I get so angry I forget where I am and act impulsively. How would anyone assess this? I've been in countless therapy sessions and have been hospitalized numerous times due to my emotional problems and mental health issues. I really dont know what to do about it, because so far, nothing has helped me",1

Apologize for spelling, grammar and writting. English is not first language it is very hard for me but I go on internet a lot and reddit a lot and you guys seem so friendly for so angry lol  

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle with constant anger issues. I get most mad when i cant do my passion good enough and i get frustrated. It is my art which i love most it is the thing i do most. it is passion it is the best thing people do. I read this reddit /r/ and i want help but am scared. so i talk now and ask for help.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate myself i get so mad i punch things and curse and scream like a devil. its horrible i hate i do this. I want nothing but to stop myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do therapy but it is hard to get if you dont have money where i am. also i am scared of telling my past to stranger who cant understand for reasons i write. 

&amp;#x200B;

My anger comes from my farther and his own issues such as killing people in the army which is why he drinks alcohol. When he drinks alcohol he gets angery and messes up situations and so he drinks again. and again it is a cycle. He did this before i was born so it was my life. My mother got sick and we did not always have money so a lot of stress. They split when i was little. You do not choose these things and it is life you get i am not mad about past, it can not change so do no try to change past. Like writting in rock. It is done.

&amp;#x200B;

My anger is like his and i hate it, i have never hit anyone who did not hit me first. i am not  like him all but much like him in this way. also. So much anger at me not others. I wait until i go home and get anger at self not at others now.

&amp;#x200B;

This was not how things have been forever.

&amp;#x200B;

When i was teenager i was so mad at everything life and everyone. I lived in small town and everyone talk about you and look at you. School was same. I was different and a queer and some hate me.

We hated them as much as they hate us. this do not solve problem anywhere it is stupid i know this now. I cry when i watch youtube of soldiers in Syria is horrible. To think I and friends be like dog Assad the worst. Nothing happend with friends but we did want to then a small time. Lot stupid talk stupid teenager and drugs. We stupid and see this and we put gun in box and take apart bomb no one can hurt we agree. Never hurt anyone ever. We know we are doing stupid thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 20's and i think this  i am bad person when i think about past. Good person do not think hurt people even if people hurt them. Anger all i was taught at home and in town and taught to fight for everything or people will fight you.  be strong person to fight everyone. My father tell me these things, be strong and how to fight with knife and gun as men will take everything if you do not learn this lessons. And same time i am weak to him. I care about him and he hurt me but to forgive is a virtue i guess. i try to live a virtue life but there is no God i think but good lesson.

&amp;#x200B;

I know these things I can not change. And now i am always mad. When i make mistake i yell at myself like he yell at me. You retard, bitch, cunt, whore and i do this most when i fail at art. Why? I love art so much.  I know I learn from farther and i want to stop. But it is so quick and i get madder and madder. The next thing i punch wall. I used to cut myself with knife and i stop for years and now i do this yelling. I do not want to cut myself anymore but i can not do this forever. The yelling the anger. I want it all to stop and so i can live. Like everyone else do. I know everyone not like me and I bad person.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw tumblr post from past and it say. ""it is like i am under water and so is everyone . I can not breath and they can. They act like normal and i am drowning""

&amp;#x200B;

When I was teenager at same time as horrible story I try to kill myself 2 time but i am scared of hell. Like the Italian poem i don't want to be tree forever being broken. God is clever with punish self killer with eternal life. this silly child thought and i do not want to die now. I want to live and that is problem anger stop me living.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is why i never have serious partner. I do not know how to have partner. And when i do who can love a bad person. a person who think this things. I would not love person who did plan to hurts others. I would not love myself. I would not talk to person like me. They dangerous person. They are like devil, yelling and being anger. i deserve this anger but i am tired. i want to live, how? 

&amp;#x200B;

I read redemption story but this story real life this person would go to jail. That is why I am scared. I never want to hurt anyone ever. Can you trust this person, i say no. Maybe it is best for everyone. I am afraid to talk. i never tell anyone but persons there at time. But one is doctor now. I am doing my best also. I do not know what do you guys think?

"I have a short fuse, especially when I mess up when I'm by myself. I'll just blurt out insults at myself, or swear pretty freely, I'll get pissed at whatever it is I'm working on even if it's ... unable to respond because it's an object. Heh.

It's a bit worse with people... I manage to be patient with people I don't know because I can always give them the benefit of the doubt, but if someone I know as more than a passing acquaintance starts fucking with me in any way and they don't respond to requests to stop over time, then I get defensive which usually means angry for me (since that's what always worked to get people off my back in the past). And then I start having a short fuse with them for... the foreseeable future. I don't let go easily when people ignore me asking them to cut shit out that hurts me, I don't forget and I don't forgive; that's always protected me well. That also happens to keep the anger alive.

That finally added up in my marriage where in the end I was angry often, at the drop of a hat, and unfortunately felt justified for it: result, I was abusive and blamey more and more frequently (I'm getting help for this), on his side he was less and less caring about the effect of his actions most of the time, relationship deteriorated = divorce.

I realize maybe there could have been another path if I hadn't been so angry... maybe I would have seen ways to leave him sooner, at least. But the anger kept me feeling safe... so I didn't look as hard as I could have.

This kind of dependence on anger isn't sustainable... like, I need better reactions than anger to manage these situations but I have no clue which ones, or how to circumvent a really short reaction time where I get fired up in half a second or less.

The only thing I'm grateful for is that this doesn't happen often, but it's causing me real and massive problems in my life right now because it finally caught up to me. I don't want to end up blowing up a future relationship because of anger... my next relationships are going to be worth saving, if I can figure this out...

So how do I just learn to not go **boom** in a half-second? How do I catch myself?

I'm really not interested in post-explosion management or timeouts... that won't solve the issue for me, I react too fast and too furiously to catch myself even half the time. :/",1
"Long story short my child got lice and hand foot and mouth from an in home daycare provider. I called and left a voicemail that her services were no longer needed. She sends email stating that contractually (which I hadn't been aware of. I had never been informed) we needed to provide written notice and thus still owed her 2 weeks worth of pay. Sent her an email letting her know as cordially as possible that she was fired she doesn't get any further pay. 

&amp;#x200B;

My child now wants to go back to said provider since, ""she's no longer itchy"" She misses being there. Needless to say because of my actions she can't go back. How do I deal with the fallout from my anger here? I tried to contain it, but now I don't know if my actions were justified. Was I too angry? How do I know?",1
"Back in elementary and middle school, I had \*serious\* anger issues, so in 7th I left the physical school I was going to at the time and did online school until I started high school, and things were great after that! Sure I'd get frustrated occasionally, but for the most part I'd almost completely gotten over my anger issues. But now entering my senior year of high school, I've noticed that smaller things have been making me irritated and mad a lot more often, and my friends and peers have started to take notice too.

I was in a heated argument with a few friends today over a certain topic, and I was starting to get pretty pissed off, and one of my friends pointed out how pissed off I've been at everyone recently and only then did I notice it myself. I'm pretty sure this short fuse I'm now dealing with is coming from stress (mostly from starting my last year of high school and a lot of issues with the environment that have been going on recently.) and I just can't see the good in things anymore because of it, making this short temper of mine even worse. I'm really scared I'm going to lose my friends and my girl friend and I have no idea what to do about it. I've tried researching medicine that can help with this anger, but most of my searching has come up pretty bare bones. I have no idea what to do and it's making this stress even worse. Sorry for making this thread so long, but any and all advice is extremely appreciated, thank you. &lt;3",1

If someone doesnt reply to a direct question I've asked yet laughs at a stupid joke on a whatsapp group, my best friend fucked over my relationship and now we don't talk, fucking people are shit. I wish people were more direct, if you don't want to talk to me then fucking say, don't just ignore me. Someone in my work has been on the cards to be getting fired because no one likes her and hates working with her, its been decided in management that this is happening yet still she's still fucking there, and people are leaving because of it, i don't fucking understand fuck man i can't get this way again",1
" 

hello guys/girls ! im not a born english speaker. so my english will have grammatical mistakes. but i ll try to explain this in a good manner. Do note that this is 100% real and i just wanted to tell this ...

since i was little i was kinda antisocial and was afraid to go in to crowded places. and i have to tell you that i was shy too. my parents are just normal parents any one of you could have. although my dad was kinda strict when i do bad things(any dad is like this). but hes nice. its just he has a huge temper when i or anyone do anything wrong.(plz dont think my dad is abusing or anything. i love him so much.its just his temper is crazy). when i was in school i was kinda alone. i had friends and it was never hard nor easy to make friends. but i never did progressed with life like going to parties, study nights sort of things students do. and i liked to hurt little animals like kittens and chicks.(if i rememebr it right it was kinda an sudden impule a feeling i felt when i was a child :( but now i dont feel like this. i love animals and plants so much.i dont know what changed in me )things progressed and i stopped talking to people even best friends. its just i dont have anything to talk unless its a topic which i like. even with my family or my inner circle i always kept my silence until they speak about something. i wasn't that good with studies but i liked science and music(even now).i felt anger in these days but not in a huge rate like im feeling now.

i grew up and now im 23 years old. after school i enrolled to a university(currently in my last year) and now im doing an internship in software eng. i somehow managed to talk with people now. its good and it wasn't like before. but i always felt an emptiness in my heart and when im alone i think about stuff which i wasn't able to do and what is worse is i always thought about what i dont have. for an example im short af ! im male 5'2 and has 40kg weight. and i had this weight for over 5 years, i was slim always and never able to increase my height nor my weight or muscle mass. all of my friends are well developed they have nice body figures but i dont have. i was depressed over this and about the fact why im not like other people..from age 21 i noticed my anger isn't normal. its so impulsive that i even do things which i couldn't believe. when im angry i dont blame others or fighting with anyone. i just keep it to myself. and to release the temper i break stuff. but i stopped doing this because i have broken over 3 laptops,2 mobile phones etc because of my temper and i cant always afford new one. so instead i try to hurt myself when ever im angry. i had a BIGG ANGER OUTBURST last 2 week i almost bite off the flesh from my inner forearm. it was painful and i think the bite force did something to a vein inside my hand and from that day my hand is still feeling numb in a some area. when in a huge anger outbursts im having this impulse to drive a knife over me or do a very serious damage to myself. so i will just hit my head or hit a wall until its over. its just so destructive and im doubting i can live with anyone like this. im afraid i will hurt someone badly because of my anger. the reason for anger is anything. if i cant do anything i get mad and the worst part is, it progresses. if i fail at a game (i played league of legends and recently i quited.), my anger will burst out like a raging fire. some ares in my body hurt because i hit them with my fist. i always feel very gloomy and sad. when im not with anyone i think abut alot and get depressed.when that happens i smoke. will this get worst? am i having a mental illness ? i need to know what is wrong with me before going to a psychiatrist. i need your opinion plz.

PS : i smoke weed like everyday. not an alchol abuser. never did dangerous stuff like heroin or meth. But tried acid 3 times and all the 3 times i had good trips.",1
"It's very brutal, but it's true.

I live in residental block so at least twice a day my dog needs to bark like mad at the door.

It gives me a headache and drives me mad.

Every time this mongrel howls I want to beat him, even if I know that doesn't help, but I fell need to vent my rage on him.

I didn't hit him for now, but  everyday I feel like I'm closer to beating the shit out of it until it couldn't get up from floor.

If it would be possible I would take him to the shelter,but my mom is strongly connected with him, so I can't do anything about it.

I don't know what to do.  I don't want to talk about that with anyone from family. It's just too personal for me.",1
simply because of my anger it is impossible to share any negative feelings or actions in the relationship. refusal to listen until I stop getting angry but I don’t know how not to get angry but the issues keep building up and I feel like i’m gonna explode,1
"I'm 24M and I haven't always had anger issues, I have a social anxiety that makes me over think and over analyze things and people so I usually dont interact with others in public settings. As of lately I feel that I have been raging and lashing my anger out verbally on the ones I love  (my wife, daughter, sister and even some of my very close lifelong friends) I feel like a total asshat after my ""explosions"" the smallest things can set me off too such as my wife not answering the phone when I know shes on it, my friends when they make the simplest of mistakes, for example I'll lash out on my friend and just begin name calling and question their thinking/decision making skills, call them stupid, idiot, mental, or some other very hurtful things.. I feel like once I start to blow up there is NO going back and there is definitely no filter for what comes out of my mouth, some of the times its stuff I'd never even dare say, it's almost a uncontrollable reflex, I have to let it out or something but now I'm finding my friends and family becoming more distant with me.. what's wrong with me? Why am I so angry? Why cant I control my behaviors and actions? What can I do to control or minimize the rage I feel inside? 

Some background; I was taken away by CPS when I was 8 and was in and out of group homes until I was 11, got adopted by my brothers Dad and he was a alcoholic and slightly abusive, ran away from home and lived with a friend pretty much all of high school,   now I work full time with 1 kid and another on the way. I smoke to help relieve some of the anger issues I have and when I run out of smoke I get completely in a fit of rage over the smallest things , like losing in a online video game will set me off the walls, if I do smoke it only takes the edge away for a few hours then when I sober up I get ticked over the small things again. I need a permanent solution to my anger before I lose the ones I love.. 

Also I am not the best at writing and expressing my thoughts.",1
"I live with my wife,our son,her parents and her grandmother.
We pay 800 of rents for what's essentially a 1/1. Everyday that 800 seems to be going down the drain.
My wife has been fighting with her family for what feels like a daily basis now. Usually about the same thing. You see every after as my wife and I are exchanging work stores my mother in law comes to Interrupt with something sometimes news about our son(that I do not mind)other times random stuff or help with the same tech that she has been taught over and over again. IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE AN IPHONE STOP MAKING YOUR HUSBAND BUY THEM EVERY FUCKING TIME. Every morning the same scrambled egg breakfast,every afternoon the same beans with the occasional different protein,every Friday rice and beans only that.
Most days an argument between my wife and her mother either for the interruptions or for the fact that she moves our stuff",1
"I have been trying to work on my anger for.. well, a long time it seems like. I am almost 30 (cake day on Friday), have a baby on the way, and still have explosive episodes of ceaseless rage. This has been going on since I was about 7, and got hit in the head with a 2 liter bottle, I lashed out at my cousin with all the ""adult"" words I knew and started ripping up grass. My mom said it was quite the sight. I had anger management and spoke with a therapist for years, with only the minutiae of an idea of how to deal with myself. I've come quite a long way from ripping up grass; I don't really do any physical things to release my anger, I just stew. Deep and unending, until I fall asleep. It doesn't matter what it is, big or small, if it hits the anger tripwire, **I LOSE IT.** Completely and utterly. I don't even have many 'Big' things happen to me. Today is a great example. 


--The Blow Up--
I got screwed over at the DMV, for the third time, with my out-of-state transfer. My license expires on Friday, and I cannot make an appointment until Sept. 12th. So I essentially can't drive unless I want to be stressed out every time because my license is expired. I also have to take my passport to show I am over 18 for anywhere, since no one accepts an expired ID.

Well this event *Set.Me.Off.* I called my wife, belligerent, in a fit of rage. Obscenities reigned supreme within my limited vocabulary, often intertwined with spittle on my steering wheel. I left the DMV on the phone. For a good 5 minutes I screamed about the unfairness of it, the hatred I had for the man ""Jeff"", his laziness about not going the extra mile like his coworker beside him had done with the last customer, and bulahbulahbulah, all ending is a terrific bellow of **FUCK** at the top of my lungs, phone thrown into the other seat beforehand to save my wife's ears because in all the rage I thought of that.

The whole time my wife was on the phone (She had gone to the dmv and they screwed her over today also, but lo and behold she is cooler then Liquid NO^2) she kept saying little things to try and help, but they were lost. Finally, after the last scream, she said ""Wow."" and asked where I was, obviously wanting to end the conversation. 

--The Down--
I got home about 3 hours ago, I am still fuming with rage about the situation, but of course now I also feel like an asshole. I shouldn't have been screaming, it wasn't worth it. I can see that,  I saw it when my vision was tinted with rage; But I can't overcome it. I know that if anything were to happen today to get me going again, it would be 10x worse.

This is generally how my recursion takes place. I get pillar of salt mad, to which most of the time my wife bravely attempts to defuse me, then go into a 'hostile-pending' state. Finally ending with me apologizing for yelling about 2 hours before bed.

--The About--
About 4 years ago, when I met my wife, I had gone through a dramatic transformation. I had quit my stress-filled job, took my dog, and volunteered across the country for a year. I was homeless, had barely enough money to get food for myself (My dog always had food, because I love her more than me) and was happy. I ended my volunteer stint staying at a friends house, which turned into becoming a roommate, landing a job, and meeting my wife, all within a year. I was over the moon. 

Well the year passed, and I worked at this job, which slowly ruined my 'good buzz'. It ended up becoming extremely stressful, and (to this day) there was enmity in the office between employee and employers. Since it was a small company, they interacted a lot. I was one of the best managers there, with my friend, and we handled about 10 people, on top of various other things. I was essential, as the president put it. Then I got fired at 5am on a Wednesday, with no reasoning. They said, We want you gone, we will give you severance, but you need to leave (can explain if needed, but wasn't all my fault). While I wasn't ridiculous upset, I felt my heart drop out of the game. I was a shell for about 2 weeks, thinking I was inadequate, until I learned what happened. This, I think, was the beginning of the end for stress-less anger-less me.

I got a new job, working with AI, which really brightened my day when I got it. It's been 2 years now though, and they've added so much workload to the group of 4 that we are literally swimming. It's become stress filled again, and I can feel my grip slipping faster and faster.

--The TL;DR and End--
I just don't know how to control my cyclical action of becoming uncontrollably upset, 'stewing', then slowly rolling off the bed to the apology floor. I don't listen to reason, even from myself, and it makes me look stupid and feel noxious. Really just wanted to post this, ask for any advice or techniques. I need to fix this again, without going on a life-hiatus this time, and make it permanent. No one around me gets angry like I do, they barely get upset, passing things off easily, dealing with it like an.. adult. I don't want my Son to get dealt this card because he grew up with it like I did; I want him to see how happy I am, because I really am pretty happy with where I am. It just doesn't show because 3/4 the time I am foaming at the mouth because something small and simple happens. I've seen how green the grass is on the other side.. I really enjoyed myself back then. I want to get back to that side so I can play in the grass, instead of on the side where I ripped it all out.

Sorry for the wall.",1
"I have severe anger issues and impulse control issues and im about to start seeing a therapist and it scares the fucking shit out of me. Reason im posting is im wanting to know if anyone one else is in my boat amd instead if seeing a therapist just ""lets it out"" like has a place they go to too just fuck shit up and get out the aggression and anger and everything they are keeping inside. If so, what do you do? Does anyone know? Are you on pills or have you been committed for your issues or even diagnosed. I want to avoid a therapist and have an explosion place that when I lose it I dont continue to harm those near me in verbal ways or break shit and instead I can go to that place. Anyone?",1
"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm in my late 20s, I've been in a relationship for a few years now. We both came from really rough backgrounds and each have a lot of issues, which is great because normally we understand everything that's going on with each other. But my anger is ruining it and I honestly think she'll leave. 

I've spent Many years working on this stuff and I've come a long fucking way, but it's not good enough and feels like it'll never be good enough tbh. For context, I do have outbursts. I'll raise my voice and bitch about stuff. I'll toss my phone or controller onto the table, but I don't slam anything into walls. I don't break anything (I used to, many years before we were together). I don't punch anything. 

One really big thing I've never done is actually attack the person. When I'm pissed, it's always at some outside source or situation I'm in and I always make sure to say ""I'm not mad at you, it's not your fault, it's (whatever the situation is) and it's pissing me off but it's not you"". I've always had a lot of empathy - I've never laid my hands on another person, even as a kid I didn't get in scuffs at school. I never call someone names. I never threaten. I never belittle people in an argument - if there's a problem I'll address the problem at hand and that's it.

But it's not good enough. I still have outbursts playing video games or sometimes when little shit doesn't work right. And I raise my voice and bitch about it. I don't do it to intimidate people. I'm just bitching, I have to let it go or it feels like I'll explode. I mean, feel free to join in and bitch with me. To add, I can't give up gaming, it's all I got to get me through sometimes and it's not the main source of this.

My gf had bad partners in the past. They would yell at her and treat her like shit, generally abusive people. Me raising my voice is a big problem. I'm on meds for bipolar II (a condition she has as well, it's why we connected, and she's also on medication). I fell off my meds trying to work a normal job and live a normal life, it was too much. I'm trying to get back on them again but the side effects mean it takes time. 

In the meantime, idk what to do. Me raising my voice is like a trigger for her past. It makes me feel like a shitty human being, like I'm some kind of abusive asshole, but it's also frustrating because it means I have to find a way to never get angry at anything for, hopefully, the rest of our lives because I want to stay with this girl. Outside of this, everything is great. But she is VERY highly sensitive and I'm trying to deal with something I can't always control. It's stressful thinking I have to make sure I never go off my meds again (which means never going to work a normal job because that's how I got off them this time, I get paid disability for other things I'm trying to handle) and never get angry again at anything and I don't know how to handle it. 

I'm sorry for the novel. I don't really know what I'm asking for here to be honest. I just needed to talk. If I'm a piece of shit, let me know. If anything about how I'm feeling makes sense, let me know. I just need some insight on wtf to do. It's worth making this work, somehow.

Edit: Sorry for grammar mistakes.",1
"A bit of backstory: I've always had terrible issues with anger. At my first big job out of college I earned the ironic nickname ""Happy."" I've gotten into bar fights, have tumultuous relationships with loved ones, gotten into massive arguments with co-workers...generally had my life ruined because I shift between extreme anger and depression.

I've been to therapy (DBT) and I meditate but neither of those have taken the edge off.  (I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder).  I've read that there are no chemicals that can help with this.

But over the past 4 years things have gotten even worse. I can't hold a job. My depression became so severe I would lay in bed all day. Thank god I have a very supportive wife who has been there for me through all of this.

Over the past year though, and out of desperation, I've been researching and experimenting with supplements and nootropics. I ran across a book called [The Edge Effect: Achieve Total Health and Longevity](https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Effect-Longevity-Balanced-Advantage/dp/1402722478) and a test called the [https://www.bravermantest.com/](https://www.bravermantest.com/) and it's made huge difference in the way I understood the mind. (to be fair, the book is a bit corny and the author has been in a lot of legal trouble, but I was so desperate for help, I disregarded that and tried to see if his *idea* itself had any merit, and I'm really glad I did).

Every day I write down exactly the dosage of everything I take, how I feel, and what happened that day. I've gone 2 months now without any depression or anger. I cannot express how grateful I am to not feel irritable and edgy at everything and everyone, to not feel hopeless, resentful and just pissed off at the world. It feels like I've been released from prison. Not only that, but I've made a few tweaks that have helped my memory and motivation. I wanted to share it with you all in case you were interested in trying. Keep in mind, everyone's mixture of neurotransmitters is different so you will likely have to experiment with dosages as I have.

**for calmness/anxiety relief:**

Magnesium 800mg / day  - dosed at 200mg in the morning with coffee, otherwise I get too relaxed. (so far Ive tried magnesium oxide and citrate, with oxide being much stronger for me, but according to this article citrate is better than oxide: [http://www.immh.org/article-source/2016/11/17/magnesium-the-missing-link-in-mental-health](http://www.immh.org/article-source/2016/11/17/magnesium-the-missing-link-in-mental-health)). 2nd article is a study on the Mg effects on GABA receptors [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18799816](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18799816)

Ashwagandha KSM-66 600mg dosed when stress increases or someone has really pissed me off. Ashwagandha is also great for keeping me asleep. It lowers cortisol. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26068424](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26068424)

L-Theanine 200mg taken as needed. I like to take this when I have a lot of work to do and I need to focus but I don't want to feel too sleepy. works really well with coffee. I've taken up to 400mg with no negative side effects. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681988](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681988)

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16930802](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16930802)

**for happiness/lifting depression:**

St. Johns Wort 2800mg / day - 1400mg in the morning, 1400mg around 3pm; SJW is a reuptake inhibitor and works not only on serotonin but also GABA and dopamine. I think it is highly underrated and has a made a huge difference in the effectiveness of all the other substances.  [https://examine.com/supplements/hypericum-perforatum/#ref10](https://examine.com/supplements/hypericum-perforatum/#ref10)

5htp 100mg taken every other day.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9727088](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9727088)

You want to be careful with this stuff to not overdo it. It will work synergistically with the SJW. I cycle it with...

Inositol - 12g minimum and up to 20g per day. This stuff has some gastrointestinal side effects so you have to build up a tolerance to it. start off with 2g in your morning coffee (I buy the powder and the taste is mildly sweet) and increase the dosage.) Also works on allowing you to ""let go"" of fights or arguments. [https://examine.com/supplements/inositol/](https://examine.com/supplements/inositol/)

The magic for me was making sure I was getting enough GABA and serotonin. If I had enough serotonin but not enough GABA, I would be happy but still be easy to fight. With just GABA, I would be calm and could avoid fights but the depression would still be there. It's a weird combo.

**for motivation**

the thing to be careful with here is that dopamine increases drive/motivation/focus, but it also increases nor-adrenaline and nor-epinephrine. add these on last, when you're feeling really relaxed lol and actually need to work. Some of you will just need some coffee. just be mindful that if you start feeling irritable again and take some Ltheanine, Mg, or Ashwagandha to bring you back down.

uridine monophosphate -  25mg - 75mg sublingual - depends on how relaxed I'm feeling and how much work I need to get done. no need to take everyday unless motivation is a real problem. works really well with fish oil. make sure you get one where the DHA is over 400mg and EPA over 500mg. It's a good idea to take fish oil everyday.

N-Acetyl-Tyrosine (NALT) - 300mg as needed. It's a precursor to dopamine, nor-adrenaline and nor-epinephrine. If you're feeling edgy, decrease the dose and take some L-Theanine.

**for concentration/general improved brain functioning**

100mg - 400mg / day Alpha GPC (Also a great pre-workout). Some people get headaches with this stuff so if you do, you likely are getting enough from your diet and probably have a great memory, lucky you.

Paleo diet - meats, vegetables, fruits. Over time, you want to get the majority of the precursors from your neurotransmitters from your diet. I've noticed that if I eat protein late in the evening, I have trouble sleeping, I think due to an increase in tyrosine. So now I eat carbs at night for serotonin &amp; melatonin, and protein/veggie heavy breakfast/lunch. Also helps to eliminate afternoon crashes. I've experimented with a lot of diets and this is what works for me.",1
"I can be the sweetest person but also the worst person. Today I was so upset, that I hurt four people who are really close to me. I hurt their feeling and I scarred them in a way where things will no longer be the same. And to be honest when I think about the reason I was angry I don’t even know why, I can’t justify my rage. And I hate myself, I truly hate how fast I get angry, how long I hold grudges and how i seek revenge. I hate myself I wish I can change this about myself. It’s the only thing I want to be free of. I don’t want to be defined as the angry girl, it’s not who I am. But it is who i am. I hope to change one day. I apologized to them. I can’t say they accepted it but I did my part and I sincerely am sorry.",1
"-in 6th grade I was thinking about putting itching powder on the gym uniform of a bully
-I was thinking about leaving an egg under the sink of my old roomate, who spread rumors about me for no reason (she literally Unfriended me the moment she met me, I was always kind to her.) she also went through my fridge and said I was selling alcohol to minors to get me in trouble with the school. I found out it was her because the school said the exact amount of alcohol I had in the fridge, something she only would know. She also went through my medication and told everyone about my private mental health issue. To this day I’m waiting for my number to change since she has it so I can sign her up for websites that spam numbers until it’s made virtually unusable.
-I spammed the number of my old babysitter on chat roulette saying I wanted dick pics after she took my phone (I was a freshmen in high school and she was treating me like a child.)

Do I have anger issues?",1
"I hate you all. All of you miserable meat bags. I don't know you, I don't know your life stories, and yet I fucking hate you and your vices. I hate your shitty driving, I hate your alcohol problem, I hate your reckless behaviour, I hate your infedelity, I hate your abuse, I hate your everything. I hate being so fucking lonely and depressed all the time. I hate myself. I want to die, I can't stand being alive and worrying about how I will be hurt by someone I made the stupid mistake of trusting. I want to hurt people. I don't know who, but I want them to deserve it, and then I want them to hurt for it. I want them to hurt badly, like they had every last inch of skin peeled off before being thrown into a bathtub full of salt. I hate the fact that nobody knows exist. I hate that I'm mostly responsible because I don't know how to meet people. I just fucking hate everything. I don't know what to do anymore.",1
As the title says I have just not been able to manage it at all and I dont know what to do,1
"Could be the smallest thing but tonight it was unexpected heavy rush and not enough help to go around. not enough prep ran out of almost everything And honestly now i just regret getting angry. Had a talk with sous chef.

Gotta go back tomorrow hopefully  i can move past it and hopefully they do to

I gotta get my shit in check",1
"Currently considering starting anger management classes, but I feel hopeless. 

I am going to try no matter what, but I feel like my anger is just uncontrollable. I'll go a month being fine and then all of a sudden I'll have an episode where I let it get the best of me. I feel like I flip out and destroy shit before my brain can even process what's happening. 

Is this normal for people with anger issues? I know it's a constant, lifelong struggle, but who has a success story stopping this behavior?",1
"I am 33 Male and I am unmarried . I dont have a stable job . I have no friends . I have no Siblings . I live with my dad .

I have always been a Ahole because of my mouth . I have ruined relationships because of my anger issues . I try to control it but sometimes I just go off even because of smallest of things .

I dont know why but I get angry at my dad a lot . He has given up everything for me and he has dealt with my anger issues as patiently as he could . But I dont know how to control my anger . I burst at unexpected times .

Today, my dad kept 2 water bottles for me in the fridge which already had three inside . It was looking messy to me so I burst out and took the ones he put inside and poured it in the sink . Thinking about it at night , I know I couldve handled it better but at the time it is happening I cannot stop myself .

I want my life to end because I am pushing everyone away because of my Anger .",1
"I have had anger management and anxiety problems for a long long time... I've noticed, now that I have trained myself to notice, that I do not have the normal physiological... Side effects I guess is the proper verbiage... That go hand in hand with it... Sweating, increased heart rate, adrenaline rush, etc... My body doesn't respond that way... I know I'm angry. I feel the emotion. Mentally I slip into it like a well fitted suit. But I don't have the 'normal' physiological things...  I was wondering if anyone else has this issue and what it means...",1
"This sounds weird and awful to me to even say but realizing a lot of my anger this year is related to medical staff saying what sounds like slick rude shit when I'm already sick and vulnerable. I didn't have health insurance for a few years so maybe I got out of practice or I'm just being spoiled but I feel like a lot of medical offices and sometimes even doctors themselves are just wild rude with no provocation and don't care bc you need their service so you have to eat it. I always feel like I should be grateful for medical help so I'm kind of over the top fake nice since my normal personality sometimes reads as ""cold"" and my mom always told me to smile and just eat whatever shit the doctor gives me because they're the expert and you need to make them sympathize with you but I feel like I'm being cartoon nice just to be shot down or outright laughed at for whatever I say trying to be friendlier than normal. having one good doctor who treats me kindly just spoiled me so I leave rude doctors furious that they kicked me when I was down and I'm paying them to help. I need to get it under control bc it's obv not helping my outcomes to be mad after I leave but I feel like it's this constant stream of unpredictable judgement about things that aren't even medical in nature or anyone's business. I had an eye doctor tell me in the dead of winter that I was ""dusty looking and you must never drink water because your whole face looks thirsty"" which was just super extra and had nothing to do with my eyes and was kind of ridiculous to say on a below-freezing day when all her patients looked kind of wind-burned. A billing agent at my primary doctor's office told me my insurance wasn't accepted and ""it would be different if you were working but we don't accept unemployed."" I self insure but own a legitimate company and my insurance is valid, just not accepted there but she acted like I demanded free care or threw a fit that I'd have to self pay, which I did cheerfully without argument. The worst was an emergency dentist I went to when I chipped a tooth on hard food, who straight told me I'm disgusting bc she knows I don't floss and when I said I absolutely do, sometimes 2-3x a day and have a really extensive oral hygiene routine she says ""No honey, healthy gums don't look like that and I can tell when patients are lying to cover for laziness."" A week later my regular dentist confirmed I had been flossing correctly and I just had hereditary problems with my teeth that had nothing to do with me being disgusting or a liar. More recently the same office keeps trying to refer to my work travel as ""vacation"" and tell me I'm not allowed to fly again until next year after a procedure that should only ground me for a week bc I've ""traveled more than enough this year"" like it was just for fun and not how I afford their services. It's gotten better as my health improves so I'm sure I'm responsible for taking shit too hard when I'm hurting and I'm sure I was stressing some Drs out bc I was in so much pain earlier but I thought Hippocratic oath extended to just basic courtesy or bedside manner in situations that aren't an emergency and the patient is def not belligerant. One doctor was so harsh with me I cried in the car after the appointment like a crazy person then called back to apologize to the staff, who were actually very nice that time and said there was no need to apologize and they were sorry I had left an appointnent feeling guilty and would move me to another doctor. Is this my temper causing problems, does everybody get roasted by their doctor and I'm just expecting too much, am I trying too hard to hold down my normal temper and getting sonned because they perceive me as weak or not mature? I'm about to have surgery next week and need pointers on how to handle this without making myself pissed or having to smile thru rude comments when it's not necessary or at least present myself as someone worth speaking to like an adult bc I'm too old to be getting laughed at by people I'm making an adult transaction of thousands of dollars with. I hope I've never actually been rude back bc they're still in charge of my care but I feel myself slipping into having an equally slick mouth when someone just laughs in my face or I hear an assistant talking shit/laughing about my accent or face or whatever in another room like I'm hard of hearing. I spend so much of my income on medical care that I can no longer afford mental health care for my anger issues but feel like I deserve at least the same respect I would get if I were a customer paying that much for any other service. Not that the customer is always right or I want special treatment- but I already struggle with mental health so can they at least go to a room far enough out of earshot I can't hear you making fun of me for the face I make in pain bc I just leave the Dr feeling bullied when I wouldn't let anyone who didn't go to medical school straight call me disgusting and smile thru it",1
Can anyone make sense of this? I'm worried I might do something I'll regret the rest of my life.,1
"and their insinuations piss me off or not even compliments - them simply drawing up the wrong conclusion about my character and when I correct them of my intention and meaning they ignore/drown me out and it pisses me off, pisses me off until I'm so twitchy I want to squeeze the life out of them I'm so irrationally angry and restless right now god bloody hell I need to meditate for real I think I have such a bloody temper and easily bruised ego - god I should  shrug them off but I'm so bloody annoyed/irritated gah

how do you guys deal in the moment? or can't physically move away (stuck in the same room because class)? I get so twitchy my hands just end up abusing my pen and I make it do acrobatics and my face is all damn tight and strained fuck fuck fuck",1
"I have a mixy new coworker who's always demanding I suck his dick, telling me I'm the only girl so I have to cook and clean then causing mess on purpose and blaming me, accusing me of being a prostitute, telling me I'm a joke and I lied about my whole career then playing victim when I tell him Ive had a valid career and reminding him he used to hang out at the business I managed playing Xbox and eating comp food but he just swears ""you were just an intern there to serve me so do what you're told"" then starts trolling for sympathy that ""see how she puts me down?! She's abusive and toxic"" even tho he was threatning to stick my toothbrush up his ass and jerk off on my towel a second earlier when no one was in the room. He threatens to snitch on me then tells everyone I'm a snitch for what he snitched about and just says so many disrespectful sexually harassing demeaning unnecessary things I lost my shit and yelled at him constantly bc I'm not just sitting there quietly with my hands folded being told this shit in front of people who might believe him and jump on board when he says I love gangbangs. Even when I tried to remove myself chill in my room he pounds on my door and tries to pick the lock yelling and same shit if I use the bathroom, knocks and screams the whole time i'm a selfish bitch when there's other empty bathrooms. I'm allowed to drive a company car so if I leave he blows me up with errands then calls the boss saying I bailed. I used to have a terrible temper with no conscious control but have made a lot of progress this year and gone since last Halloween til now without any blowups. I thought removing myself from last job was the answer bc I had a subordinate who just refused to work then would try to strangle me if I told him to get off his ass. So technically this is better bc no assault but is getting so fucking old and I'm having so many health problems and dealing with the death of so many people in my life I can't deal with this shit broke but also hard to keep a cool head and a smile when I'm already upset and smiling thru the pain then suddenly got a shadow talking shit constantly and putting me down then playing victim when anybody around bc I'm so ""abusive and evil"". I won't snitch but asked my boss open ended if I have to put up with bullshit to keep working bc dude obv thinks he's just gonna push me into being a easy victim to dump on which isn't fucking happening because I'm grown but even then he runs tells other people I was ""crying and playing victim bc she's a messy ass female who's tryna turn us men against each other"" and that was the best I kept my temper bc I just repeated we all know that aint happen so next he started going in about my family don't love me and I need to be in a mental hospital and I piss everyone off and he shouldn't have to put up with ""my"" bullying bc it lowers his self esteem and he has kids and a family who actually loves him so he doesn't deserve to have me take it out on him how pathetic and terrible I am. then laughed hysterically when other people told him that was over the line and just shut the fuck up for ten minutes but it set me off again bc unfortunately parts of that are true but he doesn't know and has no right to say my fam don't love me even tho they don't and used to bully me as a kid so that's why I even pay this little asshole any mind. He also heard me on the phone with my Dr and made jokes about I'm secretly getting my bad boob job and ass lift fixed so he'll think I'm pretty and it's not fucking funny because I have no cosmetic surgery, my natural body is fine, he's a dick for eavesdropping, and spreading rumors I'm getting plastic surgery bc I'm a whore when I'm scared af to have necessary surgery and afraid I might not make it thru, is genuinely fucked up bordering on cruel. I hear how his girlfriend talks to him on the phone and other employees roasting him for being a fat young kid so he's just looking for someone weak to unload it on and I understand the psycholoy of manipulation but I refuse to be the garbage can just to feel sorry for his ass when he lit me up the minute he walked in the door bc ""you're dressed like a whore with your rack and ass out"" on a 118 degree day. Just afraid I'll give myself a heart attack in anger if I passively let him rip me apart and taint a 20 year business reputation with ugly ass rumors and I'm the only woman so he knows people might eat it up and join him. men excuse rape by saying ""she didn't resist"" so while some people are telling me to just ""be the bigger person and ignore him"" I donno if he'd take it as an invitation and actually try me then say I wanted it in which case I feel justified being angry and matching his bullshit just to show him I'm not a target. There is no HR situation bc if I snitched I'd disappoint myself and my integrity and it'd help nothing but this is foolish to keep blaming myself that I deserve it or welcomed it bc I tried to nip it in the bud standing up for myself and he found it cute and funny. No one ever treated me with this much desrespect at any job except maybe the strangler, even dude I worked with that literally smoked crack and snorted powder at the office. He kept complaining ""everybody says you're cool and solid but I think you're a mean bitch and I'm gonna expose how fake and evil you are"" like I aint known the same people 15 years who all spoke well of me and just never been verbally abused like this on the job but to him that's ""fake."" Please share whatever help you can bc I been home a week making myself sick that I'm weak and deserve this shit just like when my relatives bullied me and I'm sure he's laughed it off, forgot, and gone back to his loving family so I'm only hurting myself and making him right that I'm unlovable and sour so I deserve to be treated like shit. I have a real anger problem myslf but I never been a bully or tried to push people over the edge, I just get furious when people assume I'm sweet and here I am again

Edit: I appreciate comments that this is valid abuse and tell HR but I know that already and there's no type of HR department or recourse- I handle it myself or not at all. This is a section of the entertainment industry that MeToo can't touch but it floors me I was treated with a lot more respect as an exotic dancer in the adult industry years and years ago when I was young. But that's why he justifies it's my fault and I'm the toxic abusive one, he perceives I used to be a whore even tho it was a ""clean"" club and I have trouble getting any job with a background check/HR dept bc stripping license shows up so I'm supposedly stuck and have to eat it. i have honestly resorted to violence w previous coworkers but they were all reasonable fights with medium sized men who respected they went too far and backed off, where as this dude might take me out with no effort just on size and no one around me should be expected to defend me or anything. The reason I posted this in /anger instead of making it a sexual harassment thing is bc my reaction just feeds him and it's fucking frightening to have no control over this except lose my job and therefore punish myself.

2nd edit: I understand normal channel is HR or speak to union local but I don't have either available so I'm just here asking for damage control advice holding down my own temper until I can find a reasonable solutio, just to stop encouraging him with the bullshit since my anger is so funny and validating to him. Also I realize this sounds like I'm a Real World cast member but just technical crew

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Somebody else vouched I wasn't starting shit and I got so mad I almost threw hot greae but waljed away so even more, I need advice how to better use my temper to shoot down disrespectful shit without acting like a clown myself, not legal etc. There is really no legal channel for this anymore given people are aware and little chance of grtting fired now but it shows me I have a long way to go being effective with my own temper

Last update: Probably focusing on professional gambling now bc you can always call floor on wild inappropriate men but other patrons usually do it first. This sounds absurd but at least no union rules lol. Thanks to everybody for offering support",1
"I will give a couple of examples.

I haven't seen my therapist since April. She went away due to ""unforseen circumstances"". I got a letter last month saying she was back and I have phoned the reception countless times to make an appointment. I'm suppost to be getting an appointment letter since last week but I'm still waiting. Again. How is it acceptable for someone with mental health issues to go 3 months without support?

My masters supervisor did not give me any help on my dissertation. He admitted that he didn't know how to use the software. Now it is finished I needed a letter of recommendation off him but he has not replied. He doesn't do anything to help me.

I was buying some running shoes online and paid for premium delivery as it was coming from Belgium. The stuff hasn't even been shipped yet and it is likely I will have to wait a week (it was suppost to take 2 days).

There's more but this is the stuff off the top of my head.",1
"I’m always angry I don’t know why even the slightest thing from just thinking or even moving makes me want to yell and be destructive, like throwing a tantrum. I don’t know what it is but I’m only calm when I’m in the rain or watching it. I love “bad” weather, like lightning, and rain. Anyone else almost always angry?",1
"Company cancels an interview with me during the interview, I know someone interested in making prank calls.Recruiter cancels interviews on me multiple times and won't connect with me on Linkedin - I know someone interested in using a private internet program to send ASCII dongs.

I'm angry at my life situation. I'm angry at the F'd up stuff my family does to me. When I turned 23 my grandmother had promised me a car for 3 years of college so I didn't pick up a second job. I got written up for having a lit candle in my room my junior year. She assumed it was for weed (to be fair, it was) and decided to keep the promise but cut me out at the last minute after my dad decided to tell her this right as I graduated. I do semi-illegal things by using points of contact that are hidden to lash back at bussiness owners/people in the job market that screw me over when I'm looking for a job and the interviewers cancel on me multiple times,don't show up, or tell me that I ""wouldn't be able to afford an hour long commute"" and stop responding to me even after I send them a money calculator showing them how I'd organize my funds. I've prank called, I've sent ASCII dongs, etc. My dad had me watch our pets the other weekend and put all security cameras on constantly in our house and put a new hidden one in in the driveway to spy on me in between me coming home from work at night. So I put a piece of tape over the one in the driveway and he texted me when I got home after watching the footage saying if I touch the cameras again they'd kick me out. I tried to buy parents an Atari retro console for Xmas and they gave it back to me and told me they didn't care about it. They forced clothing upon me I told them I didn't want in advance and said I was kicked out if I didn't take it, when I told them I didn't need anything from them and I'd rather see them put the money away towards my siblings college education, have $50 in cash to pay my rent. They forced me to lie to get into a psych ward for 9 days or I was going to be kicked out, made me lie about trying to hurt myself as punishment for calling CPS on them. My dad has been mostly ignorant in being involved in my life and my mom makes up stories when my dad isn't  home and tries to sabotage my life. I fucking hate them both. I hope they both die in a car accident. But I'm trapped here working a low wage job trying to find a fulltime job and earning my license.

In the mean time, a supervisor at my job threw away my personal possessions one day, and other days power trip and tell me I did things differently than how they told me to, which I have extremely good hearing and can hear someone whispering across the room, and know for a fact they told me one thing then didn't expect the result so asked me to change things by telling me I did it wrong. I went home sick one night throwing up and they called me the next morning asking me why I wasn't at work, knowing full well I wasn't allowed to return to work by company policy. As I arrived to work I heard 4 other people called out of work. And they threatened to write me up for ""being sick without calling to remind them I'm sick"", which is retarded in and of itself and I was never aware of that policy because no-one has ever told me.",1
There have been a lot of times in the past where people either purposefully didn't include me or bullied/harassed me in some sort of way. This has led for me to hold in a lot of anger related to these incidents. No one except one person has been a decent enough person to apologize for the pain and suffering that they caused which is a little frusterating. How do I let go of this. I feel like it has been derailing my life for the last two days. Yesterday o was angry about the way others have treated me for probably at least 3ish hours. :/,1
"So needless to say, I have ALWAYS had a problem with my mouth. Back-talked a lot as a child. Had a lot of soap in my mouth too but that clearly never made the problem go away. I sometimes get upset at work and say something stupid and get myself into trouble. Basically I was pulled into the office yesterday and was told if I had an attitude again I was going to be fired. 

So my question is, what the hell do I do about my mouth? It happens so fast, it's like my brain doesn't have a chance to even comprehend what is going on. My mouth just spurts out some stupid crap and then my brain kicks in and is like, ooo shouldn't have said that dude. 

What do I do?! I don't want to loose my job! I have learned to walk away when I start to feel irritable.. but then there are situations where there is no irritability... someone says something or does something to anger me and then word vomit. Ugh....",1
"Hey guys, I am having problems with dealing with anger. 7 years ago, I was bullied for 2 years in school while I was 13-14 years old. My parents split up, when I was 7 months old and my stepfather adopted me, when I was 5 years old. I don't have problems with anger most of the time but when my members of my family turn against me in an argument and are ignorant and toxic towards me, there is nothing I would rather do than just punch them in the face. Sadly my family can be pretty ignorant and toxic while argueing and it hurts me everytime when I'm trying to reason with them. Just yet I had an argument with my stepfather and he punched me in the stomach after I pulled him towards me to reason with him because he would ignore me and after that punch I would have loved to punch him back but my mother split us up. Also my stepsister came along in that moment and just joined his side just because... I would like to stay cool in these situations. Thanks in advance.",1
"I have known I have some anger issues throughout my entire life. Both my parents had different forms of anger issues that have both manifested it’s way into becoming the way I cope which is terrible but I’m aware of it but so hard to control in the moment. 

I somewhat always try to self victimize, get control issues with people close to me, and let minimal emotions that don’t need to become a problem become a problem somehow.

I’m really bad at explaining how this is but I’m very insecure about everything. Trust issues and think everyone is out to get me or dislikes me. I feel as if I need to be in constant contact with someone 24/7 and if they don’t answer I get slightly upset but keep it internal but it’s fine if I do the same. This is toxic for myself and others around me. This is mainly with people close to me like extremely close. This only happens with bestfriends and my parents. My mom left me for drugs when 7 years ago but was addicted since I was 3. Dad kicked me out for 2.5 years but it’s better but I obviously have some abandonment issues that turn into control issues that turn into a rage whenever something does not go my way. These emotions of anxiety, feelings of potential abandonment which is never abandonment but I think my actions of rage push people away, and my sadness and self insecurity I can recognize but I don’t understand how to control it in the moment.

Whenever people make little comments or don’t react to me in the way I expect them to in general life it really gets to me and I don’t know why and how to control it in the moment because I obviously don’t need to pick a fight about every single thing that annoys me and I don’t need to be annoyed most of the time anyway",1
I am absolutely furious. No words exist that can convey how insanely angry I am at this very moment. I want answers to this question. How the fuck do I cope with this?,1
"I still feel very raw and hurt by the people at my last job. It's been half-a-year now, and when I think about them I get a fiery feeling in my chest. It's like a poison.

I'm trying to move on, I'm back in school, and my new career is going to pay 2-3x as much. And it won't involve toilets, which is a plus. But I'm still upset with my boss, all my bosses, for being such phonies. I still have bad dreams about that place. Sometimes I daydream of going back to visit and telling them off.

Yesterday I was driving home &amp; I saw the woman ; one of the women; who really set me off. I parked, and on one hand I wanted her to talk to me so I could yell at her, and on the other hand I didn't know if I could control myself. So I went in a building and waited for 10 minutes &amp; when I came out she was gone.

... Shouldn't the depression medication be suppressing my crazy side, not enhancing it? How can I forgive people if I can't move past the hurt?",1
"I ran to Kroger to get things to make dinner. I was on my bike. On my way into the driveway I hit the curb too hard and dropped and shattered the hot sauce. I was so fucking mad at myself. I know it's just a 10min trip down to the corner store and a couple bucks. If it would have been my friend or my girlfriend I would have laughed it off. But I cant stop thinking about it. All the ways I let it or caused it to happen.

I know the standard response is ""dont be so hard on yourself"" or ""dont sweat the small stuff."" I just can't understand why I get so angry at myself when I wouldnt get this upset at anyone else.",1
"Hey guys, throw away since my friends and family know my main account. I'm not quite ready to drop this on them quite yet. Essentially, my anger outbursts have started to effect my personal and professional life. For a long time, I just let my emotions fly and tapped into whatever I was feeling. Angry, happy, sad, etc, etc. I just acted however and whenever. These were of course my teenage and young adult years. As I got older, I realized I needed to hold them in check and monitor myself. My outbursts are down to -nearly- never. But...not never. 

Last year, same month, actually. I had a really bad episode where I just ""lost control"" and mouthed off to someone who was breaking up with me. I said a lot of mean nasty things that WHILE I WAS SAYING IT I was hating myself and regretting it. But the moment I realized I was too heated, she said something or even just her facial expression pissed me off and I went back to my tirade. My outbursts have -never- been violent and has never been shouting or anything, just obvious anger and saying things I don't really mean. 

Well. Today it happened again. I got a VERY minor warning at work and instead of just saying hey sorry wont happen again. I got SO upset and it ended with me and my boss arguing momentarily before he told me to go home for the day and cool off. I was SO disrespectful and SO rude and out of line. I am embarrassed and ashamed of myself. If I were him, I would fire me.

The best way I can describe it is ME standing NEXT to myself watching someone else control my words and body language. It's not me but yet here I am popping off and showing a side of me that I loathe. I'm not sure what the next step is. Should I be looking into therapy or medication? I've been working on my ""anger"" for well over 3 years now and while I've made progress from ""if angry be angry"" to ""if angry breath and cool off"" but unfortunately two moments in the past two years have been BIG blow ups. 

As an adult, I feel like 2 blow ups nearly 360-ish days apart is still unacceptable. At least on the level they're at. I cool off super quick, but the second they speak or defend themselves I get mad again. Both times I was 100% in the wrong for my actions and how I reacted.",1
"I'm just under 5 ft tall and her boyfriend is somewhere around 6 ft. I was sitting on the edge of their bed in their studio apartment after we returned from a night of drinking. We were toasty but not sloppy. He started off by saying really mean, degrading things to her. We called him out on it but he would laugh it off and dismiss us. You could tell she was getting uncomfortable and she went to walk towards the door and he put his arm across her chest and then grabbed her arm and pulled her back which made me very uncomfortable. I was there with a date of mine who was disappointingly just watching this all unfold. I didn't know what to do to help and my blood pressure and temperature started rising. i could absolutely feel the rage coming on. He said another nasty thing to her while having his hand on the small of her back and she aggressively pushed his hand away and that was followed by him shoving her. At this point i just kind of lost it. I looked at my date and said you need to have my back. I stood up and literally went flying at him like some kind of tree monkey and pushed him up against the wall. He was taken aback and tried to push me off of him so i put my hand on his forehead and pushed it up against the wall while keeping my arm against his chest. I must have had 9 kinds of crazy in my eyes because once i said ""here's what's going to happen, you are leaving for the rest of the night and don't you dare come back"" he looked around the room and sauntered out. His girlfriend broke down when he left and said this had apparently been going on for awhile. She broke up with him the next day. I've been working on controlling my anger for years but I think this is the one time where it actually helped a situation. Even still, i'm sure there was a better way to handle it. Having the rage is hard",1
"I have anger issues. Since I was a kid my family had said that I had a short temper. One time I got so drunk and angry at my brother, that I broke a glass on my hand by smashing it on the table. I been with my girlfriend for 6 years. In those six years my anger has gotten out of control five times with her. I know it might not seem like much, but I don’t remember them. I would get angry, I would be verbally abusive and make her cry. I rarely get angry at her she could be screaming at me and I can control myself. But if I had more than two beers or I had enough my anger skyrockets and I black out. Now she is afraid of me and she is tired of giving me chance. This weekend was the last straw. We were drinking at a party and I asked her to come downstairs because her and her friend were upstairs, she basically said in a little. And I got upset because I didn’t want to be by myself. I got upset and the same thing that always happens. I get angry and I start to be emotionally abusive. But I don’t understand. I don’t have patience with anyone else. You do something bad to me and I’ll make sure you regret it. But with her is different. Is at parties, is when we are having fun, and suddenly I ruin the entire evening because I didn’t get it my way. I don’t want to lose her but I feel like it’s too late. She told me she doesn’t trust me, and she is scared of me. What can I do? I have set up a meeting with a psychiatrist for anger management, but I don’t think that would be enough.",1
When you lose your temper over something and someone comes back in a couple minutes and asks if I’ve “CalMed DowN yeT” IT MAKES ME SO FREAKING PISSED. Like fuck no and you’re only making me more fucking mad.,1
"I was hit alot by my older brother when I was little which led me to develop serious anger problems as an adult ... I sometimes get these snaps where I lose my temper and start punching the wall, bed, anything in the proximity ... Don't drink alcohol to not make it worse... but when I enter this state I'm agitated to the point I lose all control and can't maintain any sense of rationality... It happened to me today because the cell service company ripped me off and I hurt myself hitting things and feel like shit for losing it ... I just want some way I can think straight when anger takes over",1
"I'm new to this sub, and I think that it's past the point of overwhelming feeling. Baby's cry and scream for no reason and it angers me. I don't get why they do, why cry if you have no reason to cry? If I give you food why would you scrunch it up or throw it all on the floor!? Why are you rolling around in the dirty floor? I get so angry and I'll be honest I've hurt a couple kids accidentally trying to stop them from doing things, I just can't be gentle I don't know how. (Well when I'm angry other than that im perfectly fine around them) i don't know what to do anymore or how to relax, all these why questions are just so frustrating. Suggestions? 
(I'm 17, so don't worry none of these kids are mine, which doesn't help but yeah)",1
"I can't stand my brother, he used to be a nice little brother now he's a little asshole in the house. All I want to do is punching him straight on face to death, but I can't kill my own family so I punch a light switch with my bare hand and it shattered into pieces, leaving a bruises and scratches on my knuckle.

I'm glad my anger doesn't end up so badly into hurting others...",1
"So basically I'm afraid to be anger. I start to cry and shift from the feeling of anger that is building up in me, to feeling sad and desperate. 

Some background.. my father was an explosive person when it came to anger (he never took a hand on us, but he liked to throw things, scream, curse and walk away). As a teenager I was really angry all the time, probably because I was not able to resolve the issues with my parents, so I took the possibility of being angry on other people. Ofc I was explosive as well, and made big dramas, walked away etc. (all the bullshit my father did).

Two years ago I started going to therapy. Realised I had a ton of anger unresolved in me. Besides I wanted to become a better person, I felt bad (and still do) about all the hurtful things I've said to people, how I just cut them off etc. This has led me to the point that I am afraid of being angry. As my therapist has said, I am afraid of confronting my anger, I get scarred as soon as it arises. 

So it's like this. Something happens, I get anxious (that's my default mode every time something is not right - and anxiety was the reason I started going to therapy), I realise ''ok something is not right, let's give me space'', I image the safe space I deserve to open up and feel my emotions, I start to cry, and I cry, and I let it out, and then I realise how disappointed and angry I am about 'X'.  And the rage is building up and I'm just stuck there, like what to do!?!?. Yesterday I screamed in my pillow and smashed it in the wall, to the point I cannot really move my neck today haha. Other times I go for a run or smth.  Yoga and meditation for now are ok for anxiety and fear but not anger. 

Ok so the point of this thread is... What is the right approach to anger? I believe this is just one of the emotions and if I just shut it away, it won't do any good. But I don't feel comfortable expressing it, probably because I'm afraid I'll become my father.

And don't get me wrong, I don't expect solutions for my therapy, I will work on that as well, but now she is on a leave she takes one a year for a longer period, so I need some advice or maybe some information from somebody with a similar problem. 

TL;DR: I don't know how to express anger because I am scarred I will go nuts and will be angry forever and I'll lose my calmness I tried to build the past years.",1
"I've been having extremely violent thoughts that are centered around harming myself and others. I wouldn't act on them but I know that they're unhealthy. Its so overwhelming, when they start I can't focus on anything else. I don't like thinking this way. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions for managing violent thoughts?",1
"I'm 13 and my anger issues are becoming a serious issue to the point where I become immensely angry roughly one to two times a day. It can be over the smallest things, but I always end up screaming at the top of my lungs, scaring my pets, and crying afterwards out of anger. It's a cycle. My parents express no empathy towards me and, instead of helping me or leaving me alone, they scream at me and act like I'm choosing to act like this, like it's my fault. I think it's important to note that I was out of school for anxiety and depression at one point, but my anger wasnt our main focus. I've experimented with meditation, breathing exercises, and mindfulness. Nothing is working. Please give tips",1
"so i met this dude on discord, he was 15 and im 14. we started talking and then started a minecraft world, we were building a map.

I asked him wat the fuck was that and wats his prob and he said ""im going to play with my other friend in a few minutes probably"" and then UNFRIENDED ME.

"Hi. Just to give a quick tldr of my anger problem; I've been pretty much aggressive and prone to anger since I was young. Got into a lot of fights along the years and stuff.

In the past 2 years I've experienced anger tantrums, because of problems. It doesn't happen to get a tantrum that often, it is something extremely rarely actually, but when it happens I start punching the walls inside my house until I manage to calm down (never done it in public, I am just controlling myself and blow all the steam off when I get home).

I got to a point in which I get angry when people shout at me or even make any kind of mean remarks, and that anger often leads me to being aggressive (again I control myself in public, only time I cannot hold it together is when somebody actually hits/ punches me, from that moment, I stop being rational and give in to anger).

I am not sure how to get away from this toxic behavior and I am afraid it might affect me in the long run. I don't like sharing what I feel with other people, usually keeping things inside, that's why I came on reddit with a ""fake"" account.

What can I do to ""fix"" this issue of mine? Talking to people about it might not actually be that easy.",1
So there was a kid at my school who was a year younger he tripped me (I’m weaker then a normal guy) one day he broke the camels back I just snapped at him almost killed him (he was in the fourth grade and I was in the fifth grade) help me stop snapping at people,1
I just don’t know what to do at this point.,1
"I have a problem. I am really mean to my girlfriend. Anytime something doesn’t go my way or I feel threatened in any way I’ll have flashes of impulsive aggression where no matter what I am doing or who I am talking to I will become really aggressive. I have nothing but love for her but I know I am hurting her. I have been verbally abusive and my actions are not healthy for either of us. My actions have caused her to feel very low as well. I don’t know what is wrong with me. I crossed the line and I think I lost her for good. I feel like two different people and am worried my actions will now have lasting affects on our relationship. I am constantly battling to do the right thing in my head. I have voices that speak to me in my head telling me what to do and not to do and it’s overwhelming at times. She says that if I  really loved her I wouldn’t treat her this way and it makes sense but in this case it’s just not true. I have nothing but love for her, I care for her and I want the absolute best for her. She’s everything to me and I don’t want to lose her. 

How do I control myself? Is this something I can work on or do I need medical help? 
How do I convince her that I love her and what I say out of anger is not really me? 
How can I better myself for the both of us so that we may have a chance of having a long, strong relationship? 


This has really gotten me fucked up lately. I can’t lose the best thing that has happened to me. She deserves the best and I need to make myself better for myself and for her. 

Any advice?",1
I usually do not become upset but when I do it is difficult to reason with me. I have been told once you get angry you lose the argument and whoever cares less wins. I do not want to be an overly sensitive triggered millennial. I generally avoid conflict or uncomfortable situations but that is the most rational way to live honestly. It looks weak and cowardly to become upset but I do.,1
"When I'm mad, it feels like I have something backing me up, I feel safe, I feel warm and powerful. It's helpful in the gym, an argument, when I feel misunderstood, or when something happens that isn't justified. It's great for everything, but it's a concern to me that this is the only emotion which makes me feel energized.

If I'm not angry, I'm depressed or tired. I don't know what to do.

I'm a 21 y/o male who's a bouncer and works out consistently. And a lot of the time I just want to cry, anger feels like my imaginary friend that keeps me safe. It's not healthy.",1
"If I feel I am being attacked, I go for the jugular. I get disproportionately angry. I can’t let people think they’re right if I don’t think they are, even if doing this makes the situation worse or creates a problem out of nothing. The thought of other people being smug about something boils my blood. Saying “sorry, yes you’re right” would immediately fix the situation, any other tactic is unlikely to fix this... but I just can’t.  I hate coming across as weak so heavily overcompensate with aggression.

I got into this mess because I was being passive aggressive about something that had nothing to do with me.. Which is another anger problem I have. 

Also, my face twitches and I go red when angry but I also tear up in certain situations and can't breath. 

Usually my anger is under control. I didn't even realise I was capable of being this angry any more but at the moment, in this situation, it is the worst its been in 10 years. 

I don’t know how I’m going to be in any way constructive in this meeting but under no circumstances can this meeting result in a falling out. I’m supposed to be having this meeting in a few weeks.",1

"Hi!
I am going into therapy this Saturday. My anger has really been getting out of control and seeping into violence. I finally decided to bite the bullet and seek professional help.
However, this is not the first time seeking help. Somehow, I seem to have a run-in with poor therapists. The kind who just prescribe a bunch of medicines and barely talk.
A part of this is also my fault, as I am often all over the place every single time I have gone for a session. But this time I am going with a focused approach, I am going to specifically talk about my anger issues. Most of my other problems are anyway related to anger.
Either way, do you guys have any tips to share with me? Should I prepare some notes and go? Like note down my triggers? What questions should I ask my therapist to know if they can really work out my issue? I am up for any thoughts or opinions anybody has.
I know it's not going to be easy. But this time, I plan on being regular and consistent.
Thanks in advance.",1
Is anyone else a lot less angry when drunk?,1
"I have a problem... 

I work in the male-dominated industry of security for a Fortune-500 company. I have a problem, I don't like being told what to do by my male co-workers and I tend to argue with them a lot when they try to control me because of my mere womanhood. I will never ask for the help of another man unless it's my supervisor or another female. It's just an issue I have with my co-workers when they try to be controlling for no reason; we all get paid the same. I am also a few years older than them and some of them are immature to me. I know they probably think I'm a bitch, but I'm trying to make a point that I can not be manipulated or taken advantage of. I set solid boundaries with men at work and I speak up if there is an injustice. Some of the men at my job have slept with other co-workers, flirt with them, etc. I want them to know that I can not be fucked with. 

Overall, I realize it's unprofessional so what can I do to avoid losing my temper? How will my co-workers view me after losing it sometimes - not all the time.",1
"Hello all. I'm running into a lot of issues lately with regards to anger.

I've always had a really short fuse and an irritable temper, but lately it's gotten a lot worse. I have a really hard time not sounding genuinely annoyed when people make me repeat myself, or raising my voice. I'm having a hard time keeping my composure as of late. I live with my family, with my my grandparents to be specific, and I always feel terrible when they ask me to repeat myself and I start raising my voice almost on instinct. I try to run it back but the damage is almost always done. 

I'm a teacher; I teach in the private sector, which means I usually don't have to deal with much frustration at work, but lately a lot of students have noted that I seem quick to anger when i have to repeat myself too much, or when students joke around too much with me (which they only do because I try to make them feel comfortable around me and I myself get really jokey during classes). Not only does this really worry me on a personal level, since I just don't want to be that kind of person, but also from a professional point of view this could severely damage my career.

I've never dealt with this before and I don't know what to do or even how to begin to address this, so if anyone (especially in particular any fellow teachers) has any tips to help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it.",1
"Long story short, I'm a 21 y/o sap who is just fucking tired of giving women my entire soul and heart just to have them love me back for a year or two then suddenly their feelings change.

"Hello. 

Just looking for some support, advice, or hope that I can get through this and get better. 


I have a huge anger problem. For the past month I've been trying to overcome it as I think it's related to my anxiety. Therapy, sport, stopped smoking weed, relaxation techniques...


But I just seem to not be able. Worst is that when I'm calm, I realize how crazy I went. And i feel ashamed. 


Just today I had an argument with my boyfriend. He got a bit upset about some plan changes, nothing too big. I tried to cheer him up but he was a bit meh. I went quiet although I could already feel the anger coming up. Because I didn't understand why he was upset. Then he said something like ""Whatever"". And I snapped. Like I felt he came back to state once again he was upset and I snapped. Literallly sent a voice note saying fuck you, fuck this, you're an asshole you're this and that. All that shouting. 


Then he called me like wait wait wait alright I got upset but calm down... And I just couldn't. Kept saying mean things. Shouting. Insults. 


He was like please calm down, You can't think right now but you're going too far let's talk like human beings. Stop saying all that, you're hurting me. 

And it feels the more he tells me to stop, the more anger I get. I get to a point where he obviously snaps too, and I use that. Instead of apologizing, I make him apologize. And he's always like wtf you didn't say sorry, why dl I have to. And if he does, but says something bad, I snap again. 


I can't seem to stop even when sometimes while I'm so mad I know that I'm gonna regret it. I know I'm going too far. But I keep on like that for a while and then suddenly jusr get calm and be depressed and guilty and ashamed.  


I don't want to be like this. But I feel my body temperature raising, my brain going cloudy and just hate coming out of my mouth. 

I'm not like this with everyone. I can control myself (even tho I still feel the anger) around job colleagues, friends, etc. But with family and my boyfriend I just snap and go nuts on them. 

Why? Why is this? Is it possible to overcome this without medication? I'm fucking my life.up as well as other people's. 

Because a normal argument wouldn't cause so many problems, or last this long. 

I hate being me.",1
" I'm 29, male.

I'm  usually a grounded and good person, yet when I start to drink I just  can't stop, and every time it's a Russian roulette. I can switch for no  reason and spiral out of control. It's been a kind of auto-destructive  behavior since I was 15, the better my life is the worse it gets. Now  I'm starting to become violent when it happen, I haven't armed anyone  yet but it's scaring me. When I enter this phase there's no coming back  until exhaustion or passing out. It's ruining my life and the other's  around me. This night it happened again and my gf can't take it anymore,  and me neither.

All my childhood  I've been into conflicts, my mother was mixing alcohol and drugs,  destroying everything and having a burning rage inside her while my  father was doing night-shifts. I don't have any brother or sister, so  for years I spent my life alone like that. There's no doubt I'm  traumatized somehow and repeating the abuse I lived as a kid. I can't  let it happen I don't want to be like that.

I  know the immediate solution is to quit drinking, this was my plan since  last month, yesterday was an exception and it went wrong. I now decided  to never have a drink anymore, I'm done with that, but there's still  that thing in me I have to take care of otherwise I fear it'll come back  again through something else.

Please I need help I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I have all the answers but I visibly can't solve this myself.  
I'm  planning on getting professional help soon, but I don't have the more  stable financial situation and it's possible I won't be able to afford a  properly scheduled treatment, so I try to get help from here because I can't let things going this way anymore.",1
"Personally, I was born with a short fuse. No trauma caused it, I was just born like that. Mind you, you probably have this image of someone who always was angry, but I was calm most of the time, I just knew no other way to express negative emotions but to flip out. I learned how to keep all my feelings inside, but that didn't last. For a couple of years, I was in denial about everything. Not only did I learn how to bottle up my anger, I also learned how to fake every other aspect of my personality. I was in the sunken place, and I don't wanna go back to that. Now, I'm a really angry person. The difference now compared to before is that my anger actually is trauma-based this time, and there's also an aspect of being angsty that I can't just flip out the way I want it and when I want it. I've learned that so many aspects of my individuality that I repressed weren't actually bad, but anger apparently is and it still bugs me.",1
"So I just failed my second college class (I passed general psychology and humanities, failed remedial math part 2 and intro into environmental science).  

When I think about how angry I am it isn't because I failed the course, I've already put in my classes for next semester. Sure I might get put on probation but I'm trying. What hurts the most is the lies I have to tell.

When I'm at work I have friends that for some reason look up to me. A damn engineering student ran up to me one day telling me he passed his exam with an A+. I'm not this guys parents and I feel like a fraud. My highest grade in any college class so far is a B+ and everything I've passed with a C+. I also have a female colleague who's finishing up her bachelors and she thinks I'm some sort of genious.

It hurts even more with the fact that my mom is a narcissist so in her eyes I'm supposed to be the golden boy who makes straight A+s and makes her look good. I'm not allowed to say my grades out loud and she'll shut me up if I do so nobody can hear.

I usually get mad at her for being so annoying when I'm playing games, calling me multiple times even when I told her I'm going and when she yells at me.

Move up a little with the cars so i have to look ahead more faces and a finger. And in my head I was just like ""come on then bitch. Get out and come here and do something. She's screwing up her face and mouthing something at me. Calm down. Fucking calm down. I let another woman who wanted to back up get in front of me so there would be someone between us. Thing is, I might see her tomorrow and I'm going to try really hard to aboid her but if she says anything I might snap. I am trying really hard to be a good person.

"I will acknowledge that I have received an excellent education throughout my life and have access to resources that others may not, including therapy, teachers who encourage critical thinking skills, and being considered “gifted” from a young age, yada yada yada. What I’m referring to here is, I get so angry when other people do not think as critically or thoughtfully about things as I do. I also have a tendency to think that anyone whose beliefs are not the same as mine are less intelligent than me. It makes me not want to be around people my age because they annoy me/frustrate me so much by how stupid they are. 

The more I think about it, I tend to think that I’m the smartest person I know, and I can only respect people who I perceive as equally intelligent as me, if not more. I thought that it was narcissism for a while, but I do not think that this feeling comes from insecurity. Can anyone relate?",1

"I'm suffering because I have no anger management skills in that I don't know how to let it out. Here's my situation: I have a husband suffering from severe depression who is wonderful in every way, supportive, good cook, excellent human but who I worry about constantly as his depression and unfounded self-loathing impedes his job search. I have a housemate with severe depression until my husband wakes her up. I  am constantly worried she is trying to replace me; she sleeps in til noon because depression and does all the things I wish I could do to become a more charming person except I'm exhausted cleaning toilets and keeping the bills paid. She shows guests my husband's hobby stuff as if she were the wife and not me. Apparently I'm being paranoid when I get bothered about this kind of thing - she's just doing things as a friend would. She started off as a friend but lately I can't help but feel angry and resentful of her.

I'm so angry at both of them for putting so much pressure on me (financially, emotionally, they want a certain standard of cleanliness but can't do it themselves because depression). I REALLY want to kick the housemate out but I can't because she's his friend and she pays rent and is the one person I can grudgingly count on to prevent my husband from doing self-harm. 

The people who are the source of much of my anger are so fragile emotionally that I can't say shit to them.

I want to rage about this stressful situation to my parents but I can't because they'd probably start to dislike him. I can't tell anybody, I can only go to counselling, and sometimes I get advice that seems to make my whole situation worse. Lately I just want to smash things through windows and set things on fire (in a safe and controlled environment) but I can't do that. What do you do, angry and stressed people, when you feel so much anger you just want to explode?",1
"God I get so angry and/or depressed nowadays. I can’t love anyone. I cut myself off. I’m so pissed at everyone and everything, acting like intimacy is soooo easy. Like having friends is simple. Haha, no. People are so hard to understand and are anxiety inducing and I just feel empty and spiteful. I don’t know what else to say. I hate being so angry all the time. I don’t know where to post anymore. I know I need help, but I don’t want it. Suffering in resentment feels so much better than working to be happy.",1
"Today I went to sephora to return something and the lady who was 'helping' me was beYOND rude! She looks me up and down before I even got a word in and the whole time she's referring to me as 'love' and is just a total fucking cunt. I'm so angry because I wanted to tell her off but I felt my throat close up and my face grow hot. I couldn't fucking speak!! So i just left  but i felt like everyone was looking at me or making fun of me. I was so angry I wanted to scream! I was so angry that i cried on the way home, I was so angry that to keep from taking it out on my bf or breaking something I had to do some cardio and yoga. And it was a few hours ago and I'm still a little heated. I'm contemplating going back there and telling her off. What would you do: to cope with feelings of disrespect and to let it go?",1
"Alright so basically I'm a 14 year old right? And I'm struggling with controlling my anger, it's like impulses, at school kids provoke me by pushing their friends into me or call me a monster then I go on a rampage by hitting them, then getting sent or excluded, I'll be seeing my gp next week but I don't know what's gonna happen when I tell them, are they going to refer me?, are the going to sent me to a mental hospital? I have absolutely no idea, I don't really mind what they do but I kinda want an idea of what's gonna happen so I don't miss any details with the gp, I need help and if I don't get help I'll be kicked out of my school for good and I really don't want that happening..

(dunno if this helps but, I did go to CAMHS and they tried diagnosing me with depression but turns out im fine, also my mom and dad smoke a lot, my sister moved out so I don't have anyone to talk to that's in my family, my grandma is dying of cancer, my grandad is dead and there's conflict going on with my other grandma and my auntie, I've lost most love for my mom, like I don't even like her hugs, I don't like being near her, and she's so manipulative.. So I blame her why my sisters gone (which is the reason). I've been bullied ever since I was a little kid, every day I'd go over my friends house and have outbursts of anger then I'd get kicked out and it would happen again, again and again until they moved out. I rarely break objects but if I'm really angry I'll break cups and plates. I have quite a few friends that I'm happy to chill with but I do have trust issues and I worry constantly about what's gonna happen next, or am I doing everything wrong.) 

I just needed to post this because yet again I'm worrying about everything",1
"I am a very angry person and I can’t control it, I will yell even in public so loud and sometimes throw, hit etc things. My whole life my mother yelled at us for everything and I never saw any other parent like that.  My dad wasn’t around much but he was a drunk and I saw him hurt my mom badly and I saw him break things like he broke the door down with a hammer to get to my mom. He broke her elbow with the cover of a charcoal grill. Also my step father I saw him break my moms nose and he shot my brother who was 9 at the time with a BB gun. He is in prison for 16 years for setting our house on fire with my family inside. My dad died from a drug overdose. My mom would yell loud and angry and make us feel like shit. She also blamed us for stuff like if she forgot her cigarettes it was our fault because we had the tv too loud, she would twist stuff to make our fault. I have a sister and a brother. My sister isn’t too bad she is just very emotional but my brother is like me although I don’t think it is as bad. I spent my whole childhood being yelled at for everything; things I did, things I didn’t do, and she would yell then disappear for a few mins then she would come back yell some more. I am like her. I get angry a lot and I can’t control it and I yell and the worst things I’ve done is probably scream in public, violently destroy people’s things, and tried to hit my ex with my car about 10 years ago (I was angry I caught them cheating) they got out of the way and I hit 2 parked cars and a house and did a lot of damage. I am way beyond normal and I am just so tired of feeling like this. Did anyone else experience this sort of thing and are now an angry person too?",1
A customer said that to me because they asked for a discount on an item and I said no. I was also having bad death anxiety so had no patience. Ugh. Randomly felt like sharing this.,1
"I've never acted on my impulses, but I'm afraid the sudden and intense anger I feel for the simplest things might make me sick someday. 

I went through some bad stuff, mostly which I consider solved, I've accepted what happened and try to keep past things in the past. 

But what once was depression turned into this explosive anger. I get angry solely because of my brother's existence. I can't share the same room as him and it makes me want to punch him in the face so badly. I'd blame it on the mess he always makes wherever he goes, I always try to help him, talk to him, be there for him, but he can't do a single thing right and this makes me extremely angry. I've broke a part of our house's fridge once when I was mad at him.

Same goes with random people at the street, sometimes I get angry for a random reason and anyone next to me becomes a victim in my mind and I really hate to feel like this. 

I've never actually hurt anyone, but I'm known for my short temper. It makes me feel extremely guilty of feeling like this since I have no idea how to deal with it. Any help would be welcome.",1
"my parents piss me off, 

i have severe depression and anxiety and i don’t really have any emotion toward my parents, or anybody for that matter, but recently i’ve just been so angry at them, the small things they do - if my dad starts dozing off on the couch i have an anxiety attack as a result of my anger, but i never take it out on them, i can contain it well - though when i’m angry i feel like harming myself in some way, whether it be biting my hand as hard as i can or pinching myself almost as if i’m trying to control my feeling.

my dad is a short tempered person, and i always feel intimidated around him. if he sits next to me on the couch or in the car i feel really on edge, like he’s about to scream at me or shout at me for no reason even when i know that he’s not, and it’s the same with random strangers, if i order a coffee and say the wrong order i immediately feel like the barista is going to get angry at me though in this situation the feeling is more anxiety then anger.

any ideas to why i feel this way, and why i am only angry at my parents, and never strangers or friends?",1
"It's like I literally can't do anything without getting angry for some reason or another. It's almost subconcious at this point. Like I get more pissed that I'm actually getting angry in general than the thing that supposedly set me off. I want to delete this emotion from my body entirely because it is ruining my life. 

How can I work to reduce my anger as a whole? 

I don't want to have to manage this stupid emotion that does more harm than good. I'd rather it just not exist and I'm jealous of people that don't have to deal with this ""thing"".",1
"I've been called extremely nice, warm, welcoming, kind, and sweet by almost everyone I've met (and ill admit, I work for those compliments due to my anxiety to set a good first impression). However, once a person I really know takes advantage or is terribly rude to me, I lose control and let out the most spiteful stubborn asshole in the world to go and hurt them back. How can I fix this? Got dumped because of this lol so I'm super motivated to fix this trait",1
"I notice I’m becoming really aggressive in the car. Like today I was trying to merge &amp; this guy wouldn’t let me in, so I honked a lot. Then when the light turned green I laid on the horn, &amp; followed him really close for a while. Also I took a photo of his license.

... I’m starting to realize my anger problem is getting worse. I might hurt someone if I don’t think straight.",1
A lot of things have been going on lately to make me pissed. This morning I lifted weights and it was a wonderful and terrifying experience.  I usually feel a little pain while lifting but this morning I felt none.  The workout seemed really easy even though my heart rate monitor I was wearing said it was 175 bpm.  I don’t know what it was at the end of the workout because the strap around my chest holding the heart rate monitor in place fell off during my last set.  Luckily I didn’t hurt myself and didn’t let myself lift more even though I wanted to. Not sure if this is the right sub for this so if it isn’t I apologize.  Hope everyone is having a good morning.,1
"So on my bullshit job tonight I came inches away from going to jail because we have a new cunt who somehow gotta a promotion (sucking of the bosses presumably) and he's been fucking with me for the past few days. Tonight it all came to a head when his dumb ass told me to do something and the shit was wrong, so he and the other managers had a circle jerk laugh and he told me quote, ""you need to use your brain, maybe you know, think a little"".

I was infuriated! I've calmed down now that I'm in the car but I wanted to fuck him up. I wanted to kill him, I wanted to END HIS LIFE but I'm not a fighter. I've never hurt anyone and I never treat people bad. But it makes me mad when I have to bow down to some fucking clown that should have been aborted.

But enough about him and the managers. This happens all the time. On my last job my manager yelled at me for no reason because she thought I did something wrong and I lost it when I got in the car. I damn near broke the car window because I was so pissed.

When I get angry I feel inferior, like small. When I was younger I was bullied because I was short and nerdy and it was, ""funny"" when I got angry and it still happens today IN THE FUCKING WORKPLACE where people are supposed to be PROFESSIONAL and kind yet all the assholes get the promotions and people like me get talked down to.

I don't ask for much. I'm not just some lazy dumb guy (though that's what society says I'm supposed to be since I'm black). I just want to be treated with respect but I'm struggling and I know I have to deal with it because I need a job. Since I can't change it I know I have to adapt and overcome. How can I conrol my temper and my anger and put up with these fucking pitiful ass people in our society?",1
"So girlfriend and i had broke just a couple weeks ago, she blocks my number. Okay, cool. 
I end up getting her to do me a favor for the first time ever and give her some money to go get things. She blocks me again and doesn't lmk about anything. 
I went to her house last night to get my money back, and her friend and friend's dealer pulled up to the house. He kept laying his hands on me and yelling over me whenever i went to talk to my ex about getting my money back. I almost killed him. Nobody lays their hands on me. 

I realized the brevity of the situation and instead of lashing out, I kept calmly telling him to let me go and kept asking her where my money is. This dude got actually threatening with me. Her mom threatens to call the cops. The dealer and my ex's friend left, and the whole time I was trying to keep calm and keep it together. But I don't know if i can keep control anymore.",1
"My dog who I’ve lived with almost my entire life, was found to be an illness common Australian Shepherds who usually lead to their death. I can’t think of anything except isolate myself and just holes into walls, snapping objects, cutting myself, ripping books, and breaking literally anything. I’ve never been so close to anything ever. Not my mom my dad my brother nothing. When I arrive from school I always call his name for a treat or stomach tickles. And soon I will have to call his name and not get a response. He has no idea what might happened but he’s hurt by how i’ve been acting the past few days i’ve sleep next to him on the floor with my arms around him and he feels confused how to feel. Any help would be helpful, i don’t want to lose him or my mentality. i’ve had a bad experience with anger issues, school fights over small things, breaking drywall, attempted suicides, breaking things that are important to me. Please just anything that would make me feel better these couple days and weeks. I’ve never feel this broken ever.",1
So when I was going to play on my ps4 my brother said I’m playing stupid thing to get mad over but I punched my phone and my knuckles got bloody,1
 I pretty much get angry everytime I play halo 5. What do I do?,1
"The first thing is that I try to seriously limit myself to constant political videos and channels with constant updates, especially with the political climate in our country right now. I still like to stay informed, but instead of watching a video everyday, I will watch a video once a week or two weeks. 

The second one is that when I'm feeling angry, anxious, or just any other ""not so good"" feeling, I pop my headphones (or a single headphone) in and go onto YouTube and listen to ""lofi beats"". Some say that if you're sad or angry to avoid music because it can amplify how your feeling, I found that lofi music beats (Japanese lofi to be exact) really has a way of calming me down or putting me in a better mood, personally I think it's because of the high lack of lyrics where it let's my brain shut all the ""bad vibes"" out. 

I'm not saying this will work for everyone, but it's definitely worth trying. Hope you all have a good one!",1
"I am a 21 year old male who has a lot of anger inside and I get mad at even the slightest things. When someone disrespects me, I act polite but firm. There are times where I'm a little aggressive, because I can't fight the urge to beat them to death or starting yelling. I'm not scared to start a fight. I have a loving girlfriend who I have never hit but has experienced some of my outburst. I always feel bad and I wish I didn't have all this toxic stuff inside. Right now one of my coworkers is a narcissistic prick that I want to put down but I don't want to waste my time going to jail for that. He constantly over steps even though we have no business. I hold back because I have to be civil.

I grew up in a poor home with an abusive narcissitic father and a schizo mother. I would stand up to my father and still talk shit even when he would hit, verbally abuse and even spit on me. My siblings and I would fight our father when he was abusing our mother while she was ill. He only ever made her worse. I always wanted to kill or beat him and even told him he would be afraid of me one day.

We finally left him to live my aunt when I was in middle school. I started working out and doing martial arts to be a stress reliever for all that pent up rage. I thought about murder so often.  We spent a few years without him in peace. We got our own place and moved from my aunts. My sophmore year, he weasled his way back into our home. My mom is a bit of a pushover and everything went downhill from there. He got drunk and started talk shit about my older sister who moved out with her boyfriend. So I confronted him and got into an argument. 

Over the next 2 years or so, things only got worse. I stayed away from home a lot as I was always doing school sports and focusing on getting out of my situation. But that bastards toxicity just kept seeping in. My mom was becoming unwell because he would bother her while she was sleeping and he was always talking shit. When I would catch him bothering my mom or brother, we would argue. I was going through a lot of shit with school already being an AP student and friends and all that social stuff. I got to the point where the fights started getting physcial. I was messing him up because of my martial arts training. He would never shut up so I just couldn't take it anymore. It got so bad that I broke his arm and put a gash in his head with an elbow strike. Blood was pouring out and I thought I would end up in prison. He didn't press charges and was too scared of me anyway. I kicked him out a few months after that because he was starting shit. I took everything he had and tossed it outside. Everything was just falling apart apart at that point. I quit school cause I was so depressed and angry I was suicidal. There are a lot of other things but I don't want to throw them in because of the length. My life is a shit show lol

I know that I am equipped and very capable of doing harm to people. Despite that, I don't want to do it because jail time isn't worth it. But I'm not sure how to deal with my anger, especially when feeling disrespected. I often just ignore the disrepect and then it flares up later. It's how I prevent myself from stabbing someone. I just want to live a nice fulfilling life, but then someone comes along and tries to denigrate me. Most often it's some coworker who has an issue with me for no reason. Such has happened at my previous job and now at this one. I used to be an assistant manager at a gym and I got shit done even if I gave lip to my manager. I was their right hand and this other guy always tried to one up me and talk shit behind my back. But he kept fucking up. Now I got desk customer service job and  this narcissist is always trying to prove he is better than me or making comments that are unwarranted.",1
For about 2 hours i was in a fit of rage driving in traffic only to be even more pissed off once i got out of my car. I was with my girlfriend and her sister and i could tell i was ruining the mood so i excused myself and sat down and tried to breath. It didnt work so well so i decided to go on this sub. I found some posts about control and how we arent in control of others’ behaviors and put things in perspective for me. I cant change their behavior but i can change mine. Its a constant struggle but this subreddit proved to be very helpful in calming me down.,1
I have a huge anger problem. I get very irtitated and annoyed with people when they haven't really said anything to annoy me. I also keep alot of grudges against people who i feel wronged by.,1
"Hi there,

I have long suffered from anger management issues and I'm realizing that I really need to do something about it to live a better life and to be happier on a day-to-day basis.  For what seems like forever, I've always had very little patience and a quick fuse.  I'm constantly fuming if I'm driving and I'm stuck behind another car, seething if something delays me, or angry if someone disagrees with me at work (internally, not outwardly so).  There are times when something happens and I just snap and see red, for example, my girlfriend dropped a full coffee pot by accident and I yelled at her.  I apologized and we are doing well (engaged, actually), but I want to get a handle on these outbursts and have more control over myself when I am angry.  I was hoping someone could suggest some good places to start or some good advice.  I realize that a lifetime of this isn't going to change overnight, but I want to do what I can to see real progress in controlling my temper. 

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.",1
I’m pissed at the way my life is going. I feel like life is kicking my ass and I can’t catch a break I decided to start an argument with my uncle and said some awful things. Then I called my mom and called her a bitch and a cunt for not aborting me.,1
"I have so much anger in my life and i have no clue what to do with it, i have my outlets like working out, video games or being at school, but i got only 1 year of school left and I’m already terrified of post college life, I have so much i want to do and say and can’t i feel so stuck, i want to talk to someone but i can’t, it’s so complicated, i can’t keep bottling up these emotions tho, i would really like someone to talk to (outside of my school counselor, I’m not at school at the moment so i can’t really talk to her)",1
"This is a follow-up of what I said yesterday, although it actually happened last night. I couldn't handle myself and I accidentally broke something, and my stepdad came out shouting at me. He'd done this before and I clammed up, this time I said that I was ""fucking angry"" and that he was ""useless"" because shouting didn't help me. When my mom came out, I called her a ""fucking cunt"" a few times, which I feel awful about. Never used those words before but I just had to. Well, I've apologised to her but not my stepdad, who I've not spoken to. They want to try to have ""meetings"" or some horse-shit about this. All I want to do is lob myself off the balcony. We've been on holiday for a week and we're going home today, so I'll only be able to read anything you say now or late in the day.",1
"I can be very petty and can be prone to anger in rare cases and I really wanna fix it.

**Games** 

I don’t always get angry or mad when it comes to games, but I can make passive comments when it comes to casual and can bite my tongue almost every second in ranked games. I feel like it stems from wanting to be the best, and such. I see all these people. I put the same amount of hours and they become famous and pro. I really want to become a professional gamer and I know it’s a distant dream **millions** of players try to achieve. I try to hit high ranks which I achieve for a example Overwatch I reached top 1% (Grandmasters) but lost it and fell into top 3%.

I don’t have perfect mechanical skill in games, or good hand eye coordination, but it’s gotten a lot better to the point where I’m at the top 3, but I want to push further and every time I lost I self critique myself in a toxic manner. I get mad, frustrated and call myself stupid. I play another game which is a strategy game I’m fairly high up in that game I place units, but feel anxious and when I lose I see nothing but anger saying how I could be so stupid to make a horrible mistake.

When it comes to my friends they sometimes make sly comments to each other like lol nice aim or such and that passiveness drives me to overreact and lash out. It’s rare, but happens too.

All I wanna do is be the best and I know that’s where the anger comes from the shame comes from. Whether it’s in real life, in-game I want people not to notice me it’s not attention anger, more I wanna be the best at something I care about and put hours into. 

“How Egotistical is he” 

“He’s Delusional”

“Not everybody can be the best at everything maybe you don’t have what it takes”

I can guess you’re judging, it’s not me being crazy paranoid more wanting to get rid the basic comments and have more complex answers.

I have a dedication type of personality (or part of my whole personality) and I want to be beyond excellent at all I do and those little comments, those little mistakes make me so mad and I don’t know how to deal with it sometimes. It’s less of long term anger, but more of a short-term burst.

Any help on how to deal with it and personal experience would be great thanks y’all.",1
"My parents have never tried to aid me at all when I'm angry. I'm just not allowed to be, and so I bottle it up and desire to do, as many here are surely familiar with, reprehensible, extremist thing. My mom will shout at me, and even when I'm extremely pissed off, with my dad/stepdad in close proximity, I don't have the courage to yell at my mother. I can't channel my anger in social settings, so I just break my own things and act sheepishly to my mom. I fucking hate my stepdad, he whistles and sings all the time in the most putrid way, and the way he talks to normal, decent people with totally underserved, unimpressive ostentatiousness makes me want to kill him. My dad is an angry little fuck, and he's gotten threatening with me before, evem those he's smaller. I want nothing more than to call them all ""cunt"" and shout them down like they all have to me.

"I will try my best to make this concise. I use to think that I had anxiety issues but after trying many different things, regular prayer, exercise, healthy eating, medication, practicing socializing, I am seriously running out of solutions. 

Here is what happens to me in public; every time someone is being friendly with me I become upset and when someone is hostile towards me I am calm. The thought of someone provoking a fight with me is unnaturally soothing. If I am dealing with repressed anger **is it possible that anger can hijack your ability to communicate and socialize with people regularly?** If so, how do you meaningfully reduce your anger?

Has this ever happened to anyone?",1
"My husband is pretty wonderful overall, but in recent years he’s started getting very angry over very small things and he’s started being more controlling. This might happen 2x per month. Things which used to be small arguments or even just general discussions of problem/solution have turned into huge fights where his anger manifests as personal attack’s towards me. I feel extremely hurt when he does this, even though I know he is not in control sometimes.

Examples:
1.  I asked “what?” (As in—repeat yourself) too many times in one conversation, in his opinion. Caused him to berate and yell at me and order me to never say that word again ever in my life. 

2. Dogs bowl is low on water. He got so angry that he goes off on a screaming tirade for several minutes, yelling at me and accuses of me of wanting to kill our dog. 

Without spelling out the entire back and forth, he gets unreasonably angry and yells at me, blames me, takes no responsibility for his part of the issue (eg: not acknowledging he talks fast or acknowledging that we both are responsible for keeping our dog fed and watered) 

These are just two random examples... it sometimes feels borderline emotionally abusive.

We have talked about these fights days later when I’m still hurt, he says that he doesn’t really remember the details of them but is sorry for yelling at me, and embarrassed for the way he’s acted. He acknowledges that there’s still an issue but that he handles it poorly. He said that he gets 10x more angry at work and that all his coworkers have turned on him and he basically has no friends at work anymore.

The last time it happened I asked him to leave our house. Our daughter is only 1 and I don’t want her growing up around the yelling and the mean-ness. After a day apart, we talked and he agreed to see a doctor and I’d support him on his path to self improvement. 

Can anyone offer me advice on how to support him while he seeks help controlling his rage?

"Life is not perfect is what I remind myself, I've been staying in my own lane doing my best, being a better listener. Having put up recently with a few family member who were  having a few rage fits of their own. 

Long story short, I take responsibility for my 'moment', but after a year and a half of meetings with various different people to get a project off the ground. Feeling like I'm repeating myself over and over again and now being in a program where I get to go into further development. Then in said meeting when someone finally said what I had said over and over again - I snapped. It wasn't major but I got a snitty little attitude that made me look like a 15 year old. 

A week later and still feel like an ass, plus I was moved out of that module into a different group. I tried to explain but that's anger issues for you and it seems you only get one chance various situations. 

I believe it will all work out - maybe I was looking for too much external validation - which I probably was.

"(M25) Lately I've been wanting to make changes in my life like go travelling and take up hobbies etc. And I want to be able tell family and talk about it but instead of saying ""oh that's great"" and ask me more about it they always respond with ""you should do this and you should do that"". 

I told my mom yesterday I was looking at hotels for Croatia soon hoping she'll want to hear all about it but her response was ""you should stay in hostels so you can meet people"" 

As well today I told my sister I wanted to start going to the gym once I finish my dissertation and she said ""oh you should join that community gym I told you about, its a great way to meet people and they go on adventures."" And when I tell her maybe or I'm not looking to socialise she gets all disappointed and doesn't take no for an answer. Its like ffs can't I just do certain things in solitude? I feel like it just shows a lack of interest and it gets to a point where it becomes really frustrating especially if they keep repeating it and when I say it to them they just get all defensive or joke about it which frustrates me even more. I end up just not bringing it up because it just won't go the way I want it to.

I want a different life, and to experience new things and meet people! I'm tired of being the way I am, introverted, socially anxious, and childishly sensitive. Also with feeling childish, I feel that way when I get angry because I cry when I'm really frustrated.

"A little bit about me, I was diagnosed with depression this year once I realised that I was getting sad a lot more frequently with it being more pronounced. A lot of it stems from bring an emotional kid (crying EVERY day over the littlest things) and being told to just stop crying in high school or I'll get bullied.

So, I did just that and bottled up all my emotions for the past 9 years, with me just about to finish uni this semester. However, this year I've been losing all my distractions that have let me ignore my emotions, as I'm no longer enjoying my studies which has forced me to confront my actual feelings.

Unfortunately, for the past 9 years I've got it stuck in my head that showing any emotion is a weakness. Any form of vulnerability is a weakness. Standing down from your views (no matter how wrong) is a weakness. And thus I have become so much more defensive and instead of simply crying, my first response to anything I don't agree with/anything that upsets me is to express myself with anger and then cry.

I have hurt my family's feelings on so many different occasions with my outbursts, saying things I don't mean but strangely feeling a need to stick by what I said because ""I don't want to be proven wrong and back down"". Even today I had a disagreement and called 3 of my family members idiots, even though I couldn't properly come up with a coherent sentence. Like, I know what's going on in my head but I can't tell them properly coz I'm getting upset and angry. In turn, I feel like they aren't properly listening or understanding what I'm saying and are just using any attempt to belittle me. 

Was I in the wrong for calling them idiots and making them upset with me? Of course I was. But I can't apologise to them coz I've got too much of this stupid pride in not wanting to back down. 

I feel like every argument I'm having with them is fracturing my relationships with them, but I just can't stop. I constantly think that maybe it'd be best to move out of home even though I have next to no money because I'm hurting them. But in the same token I am twisted in thinking that I should move out as that will hurt them too. I don't really want to hurt them, I love my family to pieces and I know they care for and are worried about me, but I don't know how to stop getting angry all the time. I just don't know what to do.

Sorry for the rant, I've just had a very emotional day today.",1
"Lately I’ve been angry at life and a few general things within my life, some situations and people (most of it unjustified). However, I’ve been projecting my anger to my SO and I don’t mean to do that, I just don’t know how not to. I can’t afford any sort of therapist right now, but will try to soon for other issues as well as this. Any advice or similar experiences? I can’t keep doing this but I have legitimately no idea how to be happy like I have been in the past around my SO :/

Edit: To be clear, my SO hasn’t done much to justify being angry at, especially to this extent. Overall, our relationship is solid and we’re on solid ground, that feeling is mutual",1

"I want to beat the living shit out of this piece of shit my girl used to date. He took advantage of her many times and even raped her a few times. She is passive and didn't report him or anything. I am just finding out about this. I have his address and tomorrow I'll go over knock on his door, and smash his fucking brains in. Any reason why I shouldn't?",1
"I talk to my mom about my problems. She’s not great, but I don’t have anyone else I feel comfortable telling so I end up telling her. I started throwing things at her because I just felt like she wasn’t listening. I was trying to talk about a conflict between a friend and I, and she wasn’t hearing my point of view and kept on being like ‘you were horrible to that friend’, ‘you attacked them for no reason’ when I showed her a text message discussion that we were having. I started crying and saying ‘no one’s on my side, no one supports me’. Growing up, she sometimes didn’t believe me when I told her I was being bullied. So I overreact if it happens in the present. 

It’s a problem. Every single time, I tell myself ‘I won’t talk to her again about my problems’ but I hate bottling things up and I need to tell SOMEONE. Can anyone relate?",1
"This has never happened to me like this before. I got really mad because I was on my way driving to an appointment today and got stopped to wait for like 300 people crossing the road for a “fun run.” The flagger was defensive when I asked him if they were going to let us through at all. I’m betting he’d already beed yelled at all day. I went to take another route and that was messed up too. I was going the speed limit, but the flaggers decided I was going to fast and started yelling at me. Two jumped in front of my car to stop me. I screamed at them. I’m so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. But more, I’m scared that it could happen again. Is there something wrong with me? How do I catch this if it happens again? I’d be grateful for any suggestions.",1
"Hello, this is the first time I’ve posted here so please bare with me. I’m just don’t know how far I have.  I just feel like too much is hitting me at once. I’m just done with everything. I can’t take it anymore. I just want to go back to my old self. I was in a relationship with this girl for 8 months and I loved her but she played me for a fool. She manipulated me and even got physical with me. Now, I have a protective order against. I have to go to counseling every Friday to deal with everything. I just lost a good friend to suicide. I’m broke, I’m lonely, I don’t talk to anyone, I’m always so angry, I’m legit just sit in my room all day. I’m falling apart. I just fucking destroyed my room looking for a shirt. A bloody Tee shirt. I’m losing my mind",1

Now after day 3 of more crap I have exploded and everything has pissed me off.
My car bluetooth,my flashlight at work,traffic doesn't help,my thoughts grow angrier and angrier as the day goes on and my vain is aching. 

Like the post mentions I am often quite but once the fuse is lit the explosion is dramatic to myself and everyone around",1
"Backstory is I have this massive asshole colleague that I share an office with. She’s quick to micromanage me, although she’s not in charge of me at all. She’s also lazy as all hell, with me answering most calls and dealing with most of our crazy clients. After a full week of it, my already short-fused self is completely burnt out. 


Today she raised her voice at me in front of a bunch of clients and I flipped the fuck out. I couldn’t see anything, just blurs of red and black, and I couldn’t even begin to remember the shit spewing out of my mouth. I stomped away and ended up getting written up and have a meeting with HR on Monday. Even though she “started it” I’m the asshole for throwing a hissy fit, and I understand that. 

I regret getting SO mad and SO out of control. I wish I just politely told her to fuck off or something. I don’t know. This sucks... and now everyone at work thinks I’m a tool. Which I kind of am. I guess. 

Anyways. 

Hopefully one of the eighty million therapists I called today while give me a ring back so I can hopefully not get fired.",1

"I’m disappointed with myself. I haven’t truly lost my cool since January, when I thought I was going to hit a co-worker.

I was parked at an intersection and this guy drove across the crosswalk right in front of my car. He came out of nowhere &amp; nearly hit me, I nearly had a heart attack.

He parked in front of the store so I drove in after him and started yelling at him through the window, he ignored me. I jumped out of the car, I was so furious. He said it was my fault, my car was “in the way” and he didn’t come anywhere near my car.

I was pissed, this calm a*hole was totally in the wrong, nearly caused an accident, &amp; wasn’t even going to apologize. I took a photo of his license, &amp; one of him. I said some very rude things as well.

.... I guess I’m disappointed that I lost my cool. I was 100% in the right, until I started yelling and swearing. Then I’m just a crazy person in a parking lot. I should’ve just driven away, but in the moment I stopped thinking.

.... :(",1
"I've been dealing with this for quite some time now. More than a decade to say the least. Everytime I lose it, I always end up beating myself up or throwing a rage and smashing everything in sight. Also comes with it, my suicidal thoughts. Which, for the record, doesn't end up well with my anger issues. 

My anger comes from way back to childhood and it just continued to build up as I grew up. Growing up, I was the second out of three kids, living in the shadows of my eldest sibling. And competing for attention with the youngest sibling. I also find myself alone most of the time because I am a shy kid. I was also bullied a lot because I was small in stature when I was in elementary and high school years. Kids would take my snacks and my lunch because they just felt they need to. 

Fast forward 10 years later. I have been on several gigs, it didn't end up well because I just can't deal with some of the managers and bosses attitudes. 

Then here I am, living with lots of regrets and the occasional anger issues.",1
"I know that almost everyone will tell me that it’s okay to cry, it’s natural and healthy. I already know all that. The problem is, I don’t like crying in public, particularly when that public place is one of my college classes that I can’t just leave an not come back to until I’m calm enough to deal with it.
I’ve always had a bad temper. When I was little my siblings were scared of me because I would freak out and be violent. So far, the only healthy way I’ve found to cope with angry and frustration that fuels the anger is crying. But sometimes I don’t have the time to cry so hard and much that I get dehydrated and it’s not appropriate to cry in some situations. Unfortunately, in those same situations it’s not appropriate to just leave until I calm down. I’d try breathing, but the only calming breathing that makes me feel better is very heavy breathing through my nose and I’ve been told it makes me look crazy, intimates others, and is annoying.
I just don’t know what else I can do anymore. Does anyone know anything that works for them?",1
"If you are able to help, I'd like a referral to books, articles, podcasts, etc that might be especially relevant to helping with this specific issue.

I tend to plan things in my life and then ask people for actions that help me meet the goals. I easily get pretty frustrated and angry when my expectations for how they have agreed to act are not met, and my reaction really sours my relationships. Often they are small things. Some examples:
- I've asked my boyfriend to turn off the basement light when he comes upstairs and I have to turn off the light myself yet again for the thirteen millionth time
- I explained to my kid he needs to be ready to go in ten minutes, and yet he's not
- My sister said she'd take care of chopping the vegetables, yet when I come to throw them in the pot they aren't done

These kinds of things happen all the time because people aren't perfect. That means I get angry multiple times a day, and it's really impacting my quality of life and relationships. How do I learn to handle this better?",1
"OK. So i posted here the other day on my phone and poopy internet wouldn't allow me to see the rules so my bad on that.

often times when i get angry, my chest burns and i see red. my stomach turns and i feel dizzy for booting this stuff in which has gotten me the reputation of being really quiet. but i know bootling things in is no good either. been on meds for depression for a couple of months now and i usually feel really sleepy but sometimes I feel like death. main issues are uni, an ex and friends. i feel like all of them hate me. 

do you guys know any way i can combat those feelings in a more wealthy way?",1
"People are OK with slitting the throats of animals and eating their dismembered corpses. People are OK with raping animals and murdering their children so they can drink the secretions that were meant for that animal's child. Despite this, many people think I'm the weird one for eating fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. 

I've gotten to the point where I think the world is full of idiots that refuse to open their eyes. When confronted, they choose to remain ignorant even though they agree the aforementioned acts are a scourge against another living being. People can't stomach the processes by which their ""food"" gets onto their plate, yet they turn it on me when I confront them with that truth.

"Current status:  


Employed part time at a grocery store.

$3000 in savings.

Living in my parent's basement.

Bachelor's degree in CS with no CS related job history except one job dating back to 2015 that lasted a few months.

I have some freelance coding I've done in between looking for a job.

Severe Anxiety disorder.

Currently on Klonopin.

  
No license, no car. Ask my father repeatedly to help me learn to drive his car because he won't let me buy my own smaller car to take the test in, and is making me learn to drive his car to take the test. We've driven 20 minutes so far in the past 3 weeks despite me asking at least 5 times.

I don't know what to do. Getting blown off/lied to by recruiters is hurting my mental state. It's bringing me to a boiling point. My life is already toilet status. I'm trying to study for the DMV written exam and then begin studying for some A+ certifications. I'm spending all this time applying to jobs that I think I could definitely do but I'm saying or doing something that is obviously failing me at getting the job. I was just offered a job at a branch of a store farther away from me. I showed up twice at a store near me to meet with the hiring manager and they weren't there. When my interview finally came around because the branch I did well on the interview with contacted them for me, they guy that was supposed to do my interview that hires people didn't show up. I waited an hour. They had the supervisor that had his worker that kept telling me ""he'd get back to me in a few minutes"" the 3 times I called him, and finally got back to me 6 hours later, interview me. I've interviewed for telephone support for companies that constantly need more employees and considered myself overqualified, but they asked me the most dumb irrelevant technical questions that had nothing to do with the job at hand, just testing my troubleshooting abilities for things I've never done or worked on before, and decided not to hire me over that.  


I am afraid it's simply my anxiety disorder that makes me unhirable, I don't know. I'm sick of thinking. Everything is too stressful. It's always noted in my interviews that I'm nervous. Yes, I'm usually nervous the first 5 minutes of an interview but my nerves usually dissipate after that. I get closed out of positions without even rejection letters a lot of the times. I just can't do this anymore, I hate my life. I'm sick of thinking about computers. I'm sick of the things I enjoy. I want to run away from everything. Everyone I know has lied to me about some mundane shit at some point in their lives. I don't know how to trust people anymore when my own family lies to me frequently and my narcissistic mother tries to sabotage my life by telling stories about me to the rest of the family to make them all hate me.",1

I’m really angry right now and I need to get it out. How hard is it to just support me? To listen to me? I have some mental health issues and you know what would make them better? SUPPORT. I’m sick of being invalidated, of being dismissed, of people who I thought were friends and family who are supposed to be there for me, not wanting to hear about it, getting angry with me, becoming uncomfortable if I dare show symptoms.

I cried in front of a two teachers and they were so lovely and supportive. I really liked it, but it also drove home how rare it is for me to feel that supported. Fucking hell, *anonymous strangers* are more supportive than the pathetic excuses for friends and family I have. And I bet if I kill myself, there will be an outpouring of ‘ohhhh we didn’t know she was suffering! Oh we wish she hadn’t done it! OoooohHhhHh we should have helped!’ 

I see all these people who are surrounded by loving support from their friends and family. Hell, they could sneeze and everyone would be like ‘omggggg ArE yOu OkAy?’, ‘we are allllwwwwAaayyyss here for you at this difficult time’ and ‘wow you are sooooo brave going through that sneeze all on your own!!!11!!11!!’ Whereas I message people saying I’m struggling and I get GHOSTED. I get called weak. I get told to think about people worse off than me. I get told ‘everyone has problems’.

How do I deal with frustration and when  the expectations that I put on myself doesn’t match with the result I get?

"Hello hello,

I am angry, that's a fact not an introduction. I grew up in an environment where my Dad's anger was out of control and destructive and I learned that anger is A-OK and a normal feeling. I'm not afraid to stand-up, speak-up or tell someone not to be a dick. Other than that I have zero depression/anxiety (apart from like the jitters before I go into a test or something, like normal stuff) but I am angry a lot of the time. I am not destructive, my anger is like a 5 minute rant and then I go play and forget about it.

I ride a motorcycle and people drive dangerously, it makes me fuckin' loose my mind that people could be so stupid and inconsiderate. They could kill someone, maybe not me but someone else. So I go home and rant at my Mum about how the world is getting out of hand and I blame T.V.

Or, I work with a total ass-hat. He would never give me grief because he knows that I would (perhaps metaphorically) make him wear his own butthole as a hat, but he makes me so angry and once again, I rant about the stupid ass because he bullies every single nice person. No one likes him and I dance when he leaves because he is so horrible to the underdogs, he pushed someone today, physically pushed them... I just can't stand people who abuse others and my brain says ""If you ain't stopping the problem, you are watching and by not doing anything about it you are like an accomplice""

I am trying to fix stuff because I am buying a house near my work so I will get to ride a bicycle to work and not have to deal with traffic (HOO-FUCKIN'-RAY!) but the other thing I can't really fix because I like my job and everyone else apart from him. I suppose I could become a witch and do a banishing spell. I don't want to hurt him but if he could magically get a much better job with more pay and we never have to see him again, that would be great.

My mother decided to say to me ""Why are you so angry? Life is too short to be angry"" but how can I just let shit roll over me like a calm breeze when I genuinely feel that people are so ignorant that they haphazardly hurt other people and still think that they have done nothing wrong? Is that really unhealthy? I'm trying to change my position in relation to the external factors but they momentarily make me defensive but I bounce back after I've had my rant. I'm a happy little person who sings all the time but other peoples behavior drives me nuts. Why won't they just go away or just be nice? Am I projecting? I don't know.

I know that the only thing we can really control is our perception of the bullshit around us but I just don't know how to and Mum thinks I need to stop having this emotion. Do I tell her that she needs to embrace her anger (to be fair she is majorly suppressed) or am I the one that has an emotional issue even though my only emotional issue seems to be ranting?

If someone could help me figure out this burning question I would be very grateful and stuff.",1
"From the title you can probably figure out the story by yourself. I got really mad during a loss in a game and I banged the desk, and that didn’t relieve my anger so I sucker punched my monitor right on the middle.

"Background: Earlier this year, I got into a relationship with a woman who I adore. I've never fallen so hard so fast before. It's like we're made for each other.

There's one sticking point though. She has a four year old son who is, to put it mildly, difficult. He's aggressive, he's defiant, he tantrums and screams constantly, including foul language he's picked up from his biological father, as well as threatening violent behaviour constantly. 


The incident: I normally manage to ignore his behaviour and keep myself out of his way when he's behaving like that. I've gotten pretty good at finding strategic moments to leave the room or go to the store so I can keep my rising frustration at his behaviour in check. That was, until this morning. From the moment we all woke up, he was on top form. Screaming, shouting, arguing, refusing to do anything he was told. He began throwing a toy at his mother and laughing in her face when he was told not to. I snapped. I grabbed the toy from him and threw it in the bin. I shouted as loudly as my lungs would allow... I hardly even knew what I was doing or saying. Then my girlfriend stepped in and clarity hit me. I've never been so ashamed or disgusted in myself and I never want to feel like this again. 

Please, what do I do? How do I keep this from ever happening again?",1
"I have tried to figure out myself out but I simply can't and I need advice. I tend to snap very often at my boyfriend. I snap over things that usually can be discussed in a normal tone of voice. I just get angry too easily. 

I blame part of this developed personality of mine on my parents who argued openly in front of my siblings and I. It reminds me of my dad picking arguments over nothing. I feel like I get angry and stressed easily just like my dad. I only express my emotions like that with people who are really close to me.. like my siblings, my parents, and my boyfriend. 

Outside of that I am seriously the nicest person ever. I get complimented for my personality and how nice I am ALL the time from my friends and co workers. But it's different when I get home to my boyfriend. I bark at my boyfriend about little things that annoy me and of course he doesn't like that. I KNOW I can be a difficult and negative person to be around. It's hard to stop getting so angry over little things.",1
"Anger works for me in a very different way, It's not a moment of peak rage in which my mind goes blank and I go beserk. It's like those peaks are spread across my days, making me feel angry all the time, always on the verge of snapping, but never out of control enough to do it. And that's kind of good: I never attacked anyone without a reason, and since I realized my constant agressiveness in conversations, I've been working to control that too, even when I'm very pissed off. 

It takes a toll though. In those moments, when I'm burning inside but I rationally know that no one around me should have to experience me unleashing my angst on them, I tend to do the exact opposite of snapping. I shut down, completely. I'll talk the least possible, I'll stop interacting with people, I'll avoid the topics that spark that anger. But as I said, I'm kind of always angry, so, especially in the last few months, this has been deeply affecting my life. I haven't been talking or seeing friends much, I keep isolating myself from people, and the worse of it all: the ""paralysis"", almost physical, it puts on me. You see, when I'm really really pissed off it seems my mind won't function (nor want to) on anything else other than being pissed off. It just won't let me focus. I can't do shit, from talking to someone to reading a text.

I'm already not a very productive person, so this hasn't been helping that. Plus the things that piss me off TONS sometimes are soooo small that I even get embarassed of talking about them with people, thus not letting me solve that problem (I'm specifically thinking about what put me in that state today, which is a dumb small jealousy of mine towards my gf). And shit, I know perfectly that the very small things that get me this angry shouldn't, but I just can't control it. 

I honestly don't know the goal of this post. Guess I just needed to vent to some people that may understand what I'm going through. I'll be very glad to hear any of your experiences, and feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk about and share anger issues too. Anyway, thanks for reading

I also took it on someone else, this person was going through a crappy time so I decided to mow them down. I feel like I can’t do my best no matter how hard I try so the only thing I can do is drag every down with me.",1
"Let me start by saying;

I didn't think I had anger issues. 

I definitely have a short fuse but I put that down to knowing when to joke about and when to leave it and normally have a ""no bullshit"" attitude unless I'm with close friends or my girlfriend.

My girlfriend of 6 years recently told me that we should break up. Amongst other issues that I'm working on, my anger issues were brought up and she said I'm like my father. 

My father has always been quick to anger, small things will lead him to start punching and breaking objects/ walls. 

After explaining things to me, I guess she's right? I've never really been one for putting holes in walls, but I can't say I've never done it either. 

I've been working on my anger for a while. We've been together for 6 years and it was around 4 years ago that she told me about my issues and how it effects her and I've been working on it, but I guess I've lapsed and started to neglect it as I've started to neglect her. 

Whenever I shouted at her, I always felt it was justified. She had done something silly/ didn't think about what she had done and to me it was infuriating. For example, we had bought cereal and put it on the floor in the pantry where there was signs of damp and where mice could get to it and I blew up. 

Looking back now, she didn't know there was damp, and it had been a few years since we had mice. 

People messing up just gets me. It's not because I feel I'm better than everyone and they should be like me, although I do have a large ego, I can admit that, but it's because I just expect people to be and do better in general. 

In actual fact, and I don't want to blame depression, it certainly hasn't helped but I've become lazy, gained alot of weight and just given up it seems. 

My doctors aren't taking appointments for a month or so, all anger management places by me charge £20 - £50 a week for group therapy and tbh, that pisses me off. 

I've got a hell of a lot to work on, but I don't know how to work on this. I did it before, but it only got me so far and with a lack of actual medical support right now, I was hoping someone here could give me something to try?

I'm grateful for any help.",1
"All in all, I am a very calm person, who rarely asks much of my close ones and don't react violently at all. But on rare occasions, when provoced, I just see red and don't care about the consequences.

I grew up in a home where people screamed a lot, anytime there was a fight - something would break, and everyone was yelling and fighting physically.

All of my life I've been prone to cause an outrage, many times I would say they were justified. Like, I would punch bullies on the schoolyard, I would scream at people being unfair etc. This has resulted in a lot of pain growing up. I would go to different counsellors and nothing has made my mood-swings better. And I've never felt understood for the rage I could let out.

In my later years (25M today) I've been a lot calmer, and better at controlling the worst of the mood-swings. I think people see me as a calm and happy sod. I now live with my girlfriend that I love a lot, and we're calm most of the time. Sometimes tho, when we get into a fight, an outrage comes, like, I want to hit something. Luckily I seem to have a barrier, cause I would never hit her, but I scream, loudly. And I destroy stuff. 

Last time this happened was 6 months ago, today it happened again. We were having an argument (which also is very rare), I hightened my voice a bit, she told me to cool off and I got madder, she provoced me by making some funny faces at me and I just snapped. I threw the blender into the kitchen wall and broke both the wall and the blender. 

I just want to have control. She gets scared, I feel that I endanger our relationship in a minute of weakness and rage. I feel ashamed, and now I have to pay alot to fix the wall and buy a new blender. All this for a minute of not having self-control.

I am set to improve myself in those moments of weakness. But I don't know where to start, there's not like I can train this behavior, since I don't want to get in a situation like this again. I want this rage to not be a defect that I let out on the person I love. Where do I start?",1
"I’ve noticed my anger affecting my relationship in a big way. I’ll be overwhelmed and all it takes is my boyfriend telling me not to forget something, or reminding me to do something for me to yell or snap at him. If he upsets me and I’m able to catch it, I’ll try to walk away but his first instinct is to grab my hand so that he can stop me and apologize, which just ends with me shoving him so that I can leave. I want to specify he’s an absolute angel and he’s never gotten physical or even raised his voice at me, but he does like to press peoples buttons and joke around and it’s SO hard to keep my cool. 

But even outside my relationship, its so exhausting to be angry all the time.",1
"I posted this as a comment on another thread, but hope more people can learn from my experiences. -----

I've never been diagnosed with ADHD, but I feel if I were actually tested as a kid I would have been, due to my girlfriend having it and us sharing many of the same symptoms. 

Recently I've been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis at age 24, essentially psoriasis so bad its seeped into my bones and muscles making me weaker and tired all the time. My body was fighting me on day to day tasks, and I literally felt like I'd have been better off dead. Felt like a burden on my loved ones, felt like complete dog shit every day. Until the meds kicked in, and really started working. I am on medicine now which is essentially a low dosage chemotherapy drug that is making me feel normalish again, but after being diagnosed I thought started having many issues with anxiety and depression which lead to anger issues. All of this stemming from the thoughts of not being in control of my own life. 

It has ignited relationship struggles, which even lead her to warning me if I didn't seek professional help, she would leave me. After stubborn procrastination, and a big blow up, and a very real argument, I did set up an appointment. This was within the past two weeks, and I have my first appointment scheduled. 

After I made that appointment, I felt better. Felt like I am making an effort to take control of myself back. Again, I haven't even gone into my first appointment yet. But I have made an effort to take in what's being said to me, changing the way I process it, and responding appropriately. 

Literally the first step is realizing there's a problem. And usually with anger comes stubbornness, which can make you think everyone else is the problem. And people telling you what to do, might upset and anger you. It did to me, until the love of my life told me she would leave me, because I was changing as a person, the anger was molding me and mishaping my personality even. Things I used to enjoy I just didn't care about anymore, or it even annoyed me.

(Refferring to the OP of the other thread on the topic of ""anger coming out of nowhere and not having a build up"") I felt the same way with the ""no build up"", but its a slow build up I've come to realise. Its the analogy of ""the straw that broke the camels back."" You build up slowly over time, not letting go of all the stupid little things that have happened, whether it be throughout the week, or even pulling things from a month or two ago. Having a fuse that is slowly being burnt away and extinguished by an apology, but then reignited by the next thing until eventually blowing up on what seems to be a small issue and it juat all come out. And the explosion makes a mess and hurts people you love, but you've already blown, and you apologizing just isn't enough. This is something I recognize, but personally honestly have a hard time dealing with, which is coping with the wrongs done to me, and realizing the difference between a real problem or me just being petty. I have been in a mind set that my time is more valuable than anyone else's. And personally I believe it stems from my medical issues. Feeling like my time is limited, feeling like one day I could wake up and everything is just going to crash down on me. But especially in a relationship, you look out for each other and lend your time when your significant other needs it. It's not being upset because you have to stop watching tv, or playing video games, or doing jack shit with your time on unimportant tasks, and taking them their lunch at work because they forgot it.

I could type and type about the problems I have, but it's almost 3am and I'm running out of steam.

I haven't really told anyone but my girlfriend these feelings. And I hope reading some of my experiences and seeing the viewpoint of someone else going through anger problems can help you in your endeavors towards finding peace again.",1
"I am so sick of living with my dad. I'm 18 and live in the bay area. It is impossible to live on my own on a minimum wage job. I am in a family of 5. Everybody including me hates my dad. I have no fucking idea why my mom didn't divorce him a long time ago, but I guess it's too late because she hasn't found a job for years and I think it's because she lost her pharmacudical license, which she probably does not tell me. So I guess our only source of living is because of my dad, according to her.

&amp;#x200B;

All the years tolerating his verbal and physical abuse towards my mom. Yes, I call out on his shit when he does something shitty, but nothing FUCKING CHANGES. There is no hope for him to change, all I must do for the next 7 years is wait patiently until I graduate college. I want him just to fucking go away and leave me alone, I don't care if he dies or moves out, as long as he's out of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only option may to move out of state, but this would be a last resort option I wish to not pursue. I don't want to have the feeling I'm abandoning my family with him if I ever move out of state. And it would take time to get my own car to even move out.

&amp;#x200B;

What the fuck am I suppose to do? Yes, if my whole family were abusive, I would leave no matter what. I want to fucking leave but I don't want to abandon my family except for my dad. How do I just go on with this shit?",1

"This has been one of the worst weeks I’ve had and I partly blame me.

Maybe I am overthinking some of this or struggling to let go. But I might as well share it here.

ABout a week ago my brother was having very bad and violent tantrum (he’s an autistic teenager that is usually calm but when he throw violent tantrums they are really violent). Instead of working together, mom and I and my other brother are fighting on how to deal with him. We tried to mend and come up with a better plan to dealing with my bro.

Later in the week I felt like we did was argue - whether it was her telling me to stop complaining that I can’t do much art, or me trying to explain I was scarfing sleep just to fix her computer and my brothers car. I mean...we still had some good laughs this week (she helped me with trying to find jobs, and I helped her by taking care of my brother for some of the week) but I’ve noticed we’ve both felt a little more irritable towards each other (more so that I am towards my father, who is also my moms abuser, ex-spouse). A family says this because a lot of the stress in life - especially coming from oyr Family and our current job situation - is what we’re taking it out on each other since we have no where else to take it out on. I’ve trued meditate and do art to help calm my anger but today some technology that came up pushed us into a brief argument at midnight. A few minutes after the argument, I feel like fucked up in I’ve reacting to a statement she made about my sleep.

But a part of me doesn’t feel like it should be normal - I just want her to be happy, and me to achieve my goals (do art, fix my sleeping problems) and be happy, and I want to one day stop feeling like I’m walking on eggshells (now that I type this up I wonder if she feels the same . 


The thing is when I’m regretful I feel a lot of calm emotions and want to do better.  But when I’m in the heat of the moment like hearing something I don’t want to hear from mom, or feel frustrated as something she can’t understand, I just get upset and stop caring about anything other than m getting back at them - Any advice?

Part of the reason why I want to find answers to this problem is that I feel it’s awkward to switch moods so quickly, and it’s all I can think about when I try to relax. The other wants me to find a way to help and support my mom in anyway I can.",1

"I cannot escape this constant urge to destroy under the slightest stressful situations. My life is being perpetually held back by this inescapable habit.

Then proceeded to punch myself in the head a few times, wich made me angrier. After that i just took my pillow and threw a flurry of punches at it till i calmes down. Aaaand i have no idea  how to manage that, felt like sharing it might help.",1
I cant even fucking type I'm so angry.,1
"m25. I'm an angry person if you ask me. People who know me well (family/girlfriend) would agree, but they see my up sides too. People who don't know me that well would be shocked to find out how angry of a person I can be/am. I can walk away from a newly formed friend/acquaintance knowing that we hit it off, all smiles and jokes and positive vibes. I enjoy being nice and uplifting for people, it feels good making others feel good. 

But then there's the other side of me. Some days I wake up ready to tell the world to f off. Some days I wake up totally fine, have a nice morning with my girlfriend and our dog in our little apartment, but I'll go walk the dog and come back furious because of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. It seems like I can be ""triggered"" so easily sometimes, and once I get that initial anger, it builds. ""One thing after another"".

Example, just now when driving my girlfriend to work: Walk out to car (I'm reminded that our vehicles aren't in their usual spots because someone else took the spots, no biggie, but noted) get in, and the car is messy  (long haired white dog issues) which bothers me enough seeing that I rarely drive the car and I somewhat expect her to keep it clean(ish). Find out she drove some of her family around in the messy/hairy car yesterday (now I'm embarrassed as its OUR car and it is a representation of me). So that's 3 things before I leave the parking lot. Now were driving, some ass-hat nearly merges into us so I honk, then has the gull to stare US down as he and his wife cruise past, so now its middle fingers and profanity. NOW I'm heated. As always girlfriend tries to explain how I should just move on but that's not me, but I always try. Now were getting gas, pump 1-5 are blocked, pull up to pump 7, note stating only premium gas, back up to pump 6, the #1 button isn't working, pump 8 it is! Almost to her job and taking the usual shortcut around the plaza, two semitrucks blocking the short cut. At this point I put the car in park and try to keep it together. Get her to work, the mission is complete, and the rest of my day will have a red tint over it that I wish I could avoid.

My life seems to be one disaster after the next. I relate to Michael Douglas's character in ""Falling Down"" more and more every day. I'm a freelance photographer/videographer as well as working a part time job to look good on paper to apply for a mortgage some day. We aren't financially stable but seem to somehow survive. I'm a rather intelligent person which is partially why I believe people anger me so easily. I have more stresses in life than fun. I feel SO guilty after my outbursts because my girlfriend and dog have to witness them. My dog has formed anxieties, if my voice even remotely increases, she leaves the room which adds to my pain. I love my little family I have going here but they deserve more and I strive to give it to them but seem to only fail in my eyes. It's like I live this fake life where from the outside it looks perfect and exciting, but inside its sad and mundane, is that life?

Unfortunately on top of all of this, I've been toning down my marijuana consumption to both save some money and decrease my tolerance to smoke less. Of course had I smoked before leaving the houses today, I would have brushed a lot more of what happened off of my shoulder. I hate the idea that I can only be happy or normal when suppressing my anger with marijuana.

So, as the title says... What should I do with my anger? I feel like there is something constructive I can do instead of bottling it up, or releasing it upon the poor souls who happen to be around. I have a bad shoulder so I can't go swinging pickaxes on a job site (even though I'd love to) to release frustrations AND be paid for it. 

I'm sure if I met with a therapist or whatever they'd say I'm on the same track as my father. Bipolar, depressed, all the fun stuff. The idea of being like him scares the f\*\*\* out of me. I can't afford medications and honestly don't want them. I don't want to hear that I have some condition, I want to be happy more often than not, I want to be like my girlfriend and let things slide off her shoulders, I want to stop scaring my dog and having to coax her back to me... 

I honestly forgot where I was going/what I wanted out of this post. Just feels good to type it all out really. If you read this, thank you.",1

"I want to preface this by saying I've always had a short temper, but I feel like it's gotten a lot worse over the past few years. I'm seeing a therapist, which has been helpful to a certain extent, but I still have my moments like this....

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at work and there was a BBQ event outside on the patio area. There's a line of people waiting to get food so I get in line and a few people get in line after me. A few minutes later this guy cuts in front of me because his buddy is there. Didn't acknowledge me in any way. Just cut in front like he had the right. I wanted to say something, but I'm at work. There were so many extremely violent thoughts going through my head that basically ended with him in suffering/dead (if Minority Report was real, I would be arrested already.)

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, it really isn't a big deal. The food wasn't even good. What kills me is how people can do shit like that. People who think they're special or that they can get away with something because they think they can. At some point, an example needs to be made because people won't change until something extreme happens and maybe not even then. Anyways, rant over.",1
"A little history about myself (m27), I always thought of myself as a pretty happy person with a good life. I volunteered in my community, had a good circle of friends, some hobbies to keep me busy, and had been clawing my way up professionally from crappy little tech user support jobs to a dream job: an engineer at a data center for a huge financial company. I started ""dream job"" first week of June. During July 4th weekend, feeling great about myself and wanting to catch up with old friends, I went out drinking with them for the first time in a while. I don't typically drink, maybe a craft beer 1 work night a week when I play video games, and on the weekend we'd have a couple beers with a fire or shooting pool, but I used to be a hard partier in college so I rationalized""what the hell,  I'm young and this aint my first rodeo -shots all around!"" that night.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where my anger issue - that I blatantly ignored or rationalized as random ""just life"" events - finally caught up to me. Without going into to much detail, I got blind drunk, blacked out, and woke up in a cell at a police station and was told I'd be getting transferred to jail. I never had any issues with police, so this was a complete and devastating shock. When I heard about what I did, including threatening friends, strangers, banging on houses, and general ""being a scene"", I was stunned and incredibly devastated. I was released, with a judge looking at me sadly saying ""Son, you have something going on and you need to address it."". My good name, gone.

&amp;#x200B;

When I went to work, I worked for a couple days but Friday was told it was my last day. Due to the close proximity to critical infrastructure at this job and that I was an at-will employee, HR recommended immediate termination despite the testimony of director &amp; managers that I doing well. My dream job and path to a future, gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Volunteering has had to take a backseat to everything. I volunteered with my local boy scout troop that I got my Eagle Scout award from, but now I know they don't really want me around anymore. The ""green team"" in my town I used to pick up trash with has told me to ""take my time and take care of myself"" before coming back. What I felt was like my contributions to bettering my town, gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Since coming back, my friends - despite saying they support me - have yet to text or call since everything went down. No ""how are you doing mans"", ""hope alls well"", ""just checking in"", etc. I haven't heard from them in what feels like an eternity but has only been two weeks. Maybe I'm overreacting, but it feels like I lost a lot of their love. Friendships, very damaged if not gone.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been so hard. I sincerely feel like I have lost everything that made me feel whole. I didn't hurt anyone, I didn't drive drunk or something, but people seeing and hearing the anger that I had inside me has pushed them all away from me. And its on me, because I feel like I've always known it was there, yet never confronted it. After all, I always thought of it as something I can handle on my own, ""it wasn't that serious"". Its been so easy to just be depressed - and even more angry - about all of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I can tell you that I have been feeling so much better because I've been confronting it, despite the setbacks. I've been seeing a therapist specializing with anger, I've admitted to my family and siblings about my anger issues and how it was all inside me looking for a way out, and I've been praying/meditating/ just sitting quietly focusing on the person I am and not what my anger wants me to be. I go to a local, open AA group where we just open up to one another about how we're feeling and its a powerful connection. I've set myself back by miles, and I can only claw myself back an inch at a time, but so long as I try to make every day a step forward I'll get there.

&amp;#x200B;

My anger wants me to be feared if not respected and always ""on the attack"". It also turns me against those I love and those that love me. It wants me to isolate myself, so it can have me ""all to itself"". But by catching the angry thoughts and the negative feedback loop it puts me in, I'm feeling that over time I'll get back to where I was. I try to exercise, walk my dog, read a bit, and make sure every day I'm getting closer to the life I had. I still need to deal with the legal consequences, but I know that whatever is coming that ultimately I am dealing with the root of the problem. Everyday has felt a bit lonely going through it, but at the same time this is a race only I can carry myself to the end of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling helpless, lonely, frightened, and upset are all natural emotions in dealing with our collective flaw. The way out of it isn't instant - and in fact its lifelong maintenance. But you can inch yourself forward everyday, no matter how small the step. And feel *good about that*. And let it embolden you for the next one.

Hope my story relates to you in a way. Love y'all.",1
"I play video games (league of legends mostly ) and I get super angry at them.mostly player vs player. I have broken about 5 keyboards 3 computer screens 3-4 mouses and I'm just done, this time I snapped my keyboard in half and just started going psycho and kept hitting myself in the head because I was mad at myself for getting angry. The worst part is that I don't know why I'm even angry in the first place. I die in a game and I try and question why I'm angry  I just can't find out why maybe it's my ego idk I just need something what should I do?

I'm done playing the game for good and will try and play more peaceful games I know the anger wasn't from the game it's coming from me so avoiding the game will only get rid of the anger for so long until something else  becauses the reason for my anger. I need to figure out what makes me angry so I can begin to try and control it.",1

"So a little backstory, I have had OCD since I was a kid but after my teenage years it’s when he got more triggered. They are a lot of things that trigger my OCD but one of them has to do with people touching me or people touching things or others that I care for. When a stranger touches me (it can a tab on the shoulder or a light poke) it just pisses me off so much that I just want to fight them, because I just think that you shouldn’t be touching people that you don’t know, I know this might sound stupid for others but for me is very serious and it messes with my emotional being. Besides OCD when I get angry I tend to tremble/shake, I start to sweat and I just cannot confront that person because what I want to do is fight or just yelled at them, so due to this I am the type of person that most of the times when I get angry Istays quiet, I don’t speak and I let my feelings build up and when I’m alone I throw things and I just regret not saying anything, but when I do speak up afterwords I feel that I was being rude and that I was maybe being exaggerated.

So today I was at work. I work with my boyfriend. Recently a new lady started working there she is around 40 years old but she doesn’t look her age, I will admit that she looks fairly young and she has a younger boyfriend. So she’s this type of person that likes to touch everything and everyone and I am not with that so knowing the way that I am I stay quiet, but today when I got to work and she just walked up to my boyfriend, held his arms and kiss it... what the fuck? I don’t mind girls saying hi to my boyfriend with a hug or with a kiss on the cheek but just holding his arm and just kissing it that was just weird and so out of place and I felt so disrespected because I was standing right there. And I know that I looked pissed off because when I’m pissed the only thing that I cannot control is my bitch face.

So my boyfriend noticed that I got mad, he too found it very weird and disrespectful that she did that to him. And then again I decided to stay quiet like always and my mind just started running and being a mess. I was shaking and feeling angry, I was sweating and I was burning up. I just kept thinking I should say something, I should speak up because if I allow this now it’s going to happening again and then how am I going to stop at if I let it slide?

So after maybe one or two hours reflecting on why I should say something, I took a deep breath trying to calm my anger down and I walked up to her and told her that what she did to make me feel comfortable and I explained that I didn’t like when people touch me and that also goes with my boyfriend. I explain to her the situation and she completely understood and she apologized, she said that she wasn’t gonna do it again. I told her that this is the place we work and I don’t want us to be awkward and after all that we ended up in a good note.

Honestly this is a big deal for me because I was a said before when I get angry I just stay quiet and let those feelings get the best of me and then at the end of the day or after weeks or years I’m just sitting down remembering that moment and regretting that I didn’t speak up. I’m just happy that I could control my anger and that I didn’t lash out and was able to calm down and talk it out even though I was shaking I managed to speak up. This is a big step for me because now I shouldn’t stay quiet whenever someone does something that I don’t like, I should just speak up and be calm about it and not lash out like sometimes I do.",1
"Tl;Dr : Looking for ways to quell anger in the heat of the moment, specifically in gaming and sports

I find it hard sometimes to control rage in the heat of the moment. The main source of this is usually video games. Normally I really enjoy them and don't have a problem besides occasional frustration that everyone gets. But when I don't play well at all for awhile, or especially when I feel I get screwed out of something in-game, I literally want to chuck my controller out the window. I used to throw controllers a lot (I'm lucky I haven't broken one) but haven't done that as much, so I suppose I've somewhat improved. But now I've taken to smacking the arm of my chair hard, causing them to basically break.

Another is during baseball practices, specifically batting practice. When I can't get a hit to save my life I feel the urge to chuck my bag against the drop-down curtain. I've had two absolute freak-outs during practice that embarrassed me a bit. My coach understands and also sees that it means I care, but I also know it's way out of line.

What are things I can do to quell these feelings in the moment? I don't want to just build up the anger but I also need to quit having temper tantrums.",1
I’ve had anger problems for as long as I can remember it’s just recently I’ve started to really notice my issues and where they originate from. I’m 25 and I have no clue how to even start to talk about what frustrates me or upsets me. I’m a “go with the flow” kind of guy and don’t like upsetting people or causing a scene so I bottle up everything. And in turn I have days where something just isn’t clicking and if my S/O asks me what my deal is even in a slightly rude tone I can feel myself about to snap. I do my best but sometimes I can’t control it. I guess what I’m asking is if anyone has tips or exercises for being able to express myself a little better so I’m not just bottling up till I explode. Thanks for reading.,1
"Firs time posting here &amp; slightly venting so sorry if it's long. &amp; Not really sure how to start. (Apologies for mobile format)

I've always had anger problems. I have a ""short fuse"" I suppose &amp; it doesn't take much to tick me off at the best of times but I'm usually good at keeping it under wraps &amp; just swallowing it down &amp; lock it away in a room but then there's so much in there &amp; it explodes - usually at the worst things. 

I don't feel like myself when I'm angry, a lot of the time it feels like a part of me I keep locked away that I disassociate myself from (like a lot of negative stuff)  gets let out &amp; DESTROYS everything around me. 

My partner started saying something like that to, referring to when I'm angry as ""she, her, angry you"" etc &amp; he isn't the first person to do that (referring to when I'm angry as a seperate person almost) which terrifies me &amp; I feel like it triggers part of my anxiety because I don't think I have split personality. But when I get angry it's like I snap &amp; switch into somebody else: I still see out of my own eyes, I can feel the words coming from my mouth, my normal thoughts are still there but then it's like a dark whisper in my ear &amp; the steering wheel that is myself is ripped away from me &amp; I just rip into whoever has set something off. 

I know my anger mostly got so much control because when I got sad/anxious it became better to flip out then let someone who hurt me see they had the power to make me cry/make sure they couldn't see me in a panic attack. 
But now when I do get out of that rage fit or sadness I can't talk &amp; I end up stonewalling whoever is trying to talk to me &amp; closing down for half an hour until my throat doesn't feel closed up &amp; I can respond with actual sentences that aren't just a few yes-no words. 

It's getting to the point where the smallest most insignificant things will set me off, &amp; it doesn't matter if it's something just like the milk getting left out or finding out the I got cheated on - I have the same rage reaction. 

Usually there's a ""scale"" of how angry I get minor things I wouldn't get over a 2, just slightly tiffed but you wave off the other person they're having a bad day/slightly bothered at yourself sorta frustration. 
But now everything feels like it's jumping up to a 8, &amp; a 10 is when I completely black out &amp; have usually lost everything because everything I suppressed is let out at once but targeted at a specific thing so usually whoever that is we don't talk anymore. I haven't been a 10 in 6+ years &amp; I never want to get back to that angry again but every time I get angry it feels harder &amp; harder to snap out. The things that used to calm me just make me feel indifferent. 

When my boyfriend &amp; I get into a argument lately he tells me I've said things &amp; some things I genuinely can't remember. I remember thinking them. I remember biting back A LOT WORSE because I know that wasn't how I actually felt I was just angry but then when I go to argue back saying I didn't I get this horrible pit in my stomach I might have. Which when I get into that same anger but it's via text I reread things I sent just to look at the screen &amp; go 'but I swear I didn't hit send. I retyped that.""

But part of me is just refusing to remember like part of me knows I went too far but doesn't want to admit I'm becoming such a fucking horrible person &amp; my control is slipping &amp; I'm terrified. 
I haven't done anything physical. The worst I get is a nervous scratch on myself it's just the emotional/mental stuff where I get toxic. 

&amp; I know it's taking it's toll on my boyfriend but I don't know where I'm supposed to start. I had tried therapy in my area but I'm too old for the free sessions now (not that they had helped much) &amp; the others are all too expensive &amp; I can't afford to take time off work to go to the sessions &amp; I don't have the internet at home to have video sessions etc. 

To make it short:
I just. I need help. My anger is so out of control it feels like I hit a switch &amp; become this horrible toxic version of myself &amp; I hate it. I'm a girl who HATES conflict with a passion, I may as well be the poster girl of fluffy sweaters &amp; having cute puppy pats &amp; ice cream. So when my anger gets out of control it feels so wrong but I can't pull myself out of it. But I need to, because it's getting too far &amp; destroying the few relationships I have around me.",1
"hi to all, 

&amp;#x200B;

is there anyone else who feels pure murderous rage when angry? like, not just a ""ugh i could hit you!"" rage but a seething, long drawn out, ""i honestly have to seclude myself before i seriously hurt others or myself"" literally anytime they're mad? idk how to fix it just hoping i'm not alone",1
"I'm on edge. I walked out of a carpentry job because my boss kept coming in throwing temper tantrums and calling his wife a whore. I dont know what to say if this employer asks about previous employment. I've had a lot of jobs this past year, and I've walked out on all of them for similar reasons. I guess my mentality is that if you want to openly disrespect me, you can find someone else to help you.

"So every time me and my friends decide to meet, we go to our mutual friends house to who’s got an interest in dnd and we often have sessions of dnd together and when we’re not at our mates playing dnd we go out and play Pokemon go (don’t judge) during one session of PoGo my friend got frustrated at me for using “weak” Pokemon on a raid (I say weak with quotations because “weak” subjective but anyway back to the story) we leave unable to complete it and we hear a song playing loudly on a speaker which I pick up as “Come as you are” by nirvana, his gf also recognised it as a nirvana song and my friend, confused, asks what she’s talking about and says it isn’t nirvana it’s metallica, I then tell him he’s wrong and that it was indeed nirvana on the radio playing and this point he just tells me to fuck off and I’m left bewildered as to why. 

I ask him why and he says “I don’t want to see you” and I’m just left confused as to what I did standing in the middle of a park on my own with phone in hand, so I ring him to ask why he’s made at me because by that time he was miles away from the park we were in and he doesn’t answer, so I ring my mutual to see if he can get in touch and he refuses saying “this isn’t my concern and it’s something you two should sort out by yourselves” Which annoys me because he’s made calls on his behalf countless times but won’t do the same to me, I tell him I can’t because he won’t answer my calls and he tells me to ring him tomorrow and to consider getting professional help for my anger, basically insinuating I’m crazy. So I have no choice but to leave it and go home.

I’m at home playing games on my xb1 and he posts a bunch Pokemon he caught whilst playing PoGo into a group me, him and his gf are in and one of them he caught is particularly valuable so another member responds to him and says he would like to trade, I tell them both to be careful because a Pokemon’s stats change when they’re traded. I then get messages from his gf about how I should’ve kept it secret and another message after from my friend saying that “it’s funny I’m now bffs with this dude”.

I send him a screen capture of my dms to show him I’ve never spoken to him before and that’s where we are now. He still won’t answer my calls and another thing to mention was he had a bottle of alcohol with so I thought his judgement might have been a bit impaired. 

Tl:dr might have lost a friend of 3 years due either to a domino effect of shitty situations that were beyond my control or my anger.",1
"
For example I just started learning guitar, and I’m fully aware that it’s going to be difficult. But I mess up a couple times and have to put it down before I break it. Same thing happens with games, I’m fine until I die a couple times

"I’ve always had a temper ever since I knew at a very young age. I’m 16 and I can’t handle small situations, it just makes me feel agitated and I get really annoyed. I’d say my anger is moderate but can vary at points. I sometimes say “I want to kill myself” or “I’d rather be dead than alive”
The words sound unpleasant and extreme but sometimes the words just come without thinking. I feel like my family knows my triggers but use them against me cause they know what makes me angry and they still do it. I have contemplated suicide at times and have attempted self harm. Just having a pessimistic mindset doesn’t help at all when your angry. I would sometimes punch myself in the face and bang my hand into my face. It’s purely in the moment when anger arises. To release anger I have to talk to myself and vent out any emotions and maybe even cry.",1

"I smashed my phone into the wall and made a little hole behind my sister’s bedroom door. No one’s going to suspect it was me, they’ll think she just slammed open the door and left a hole there. I was so uncontrollably angry, my hands were shaking. Now, there’s still a rage in me. But today I also discovered there’s nothing left in me. When you look at me, there’s nothing behind my eyes. It’s all empty. Crazy, isn’t it?",1

"I guess i am just looking for some advice. I'm a 26 y/o female with typically a great life, 95% of the time i'm happy, focused, and calm. However (usually when I am driving) something will set me off and i will go into this rage, it feels like someone has flipped a switch, i won't even remember what i did or said because i feel like i am just this existence of anger, and it's getting worse.

If i consciously think about staying calm it can help, but i'm worried that it's going to get so extreme i will end up hurting someone and i don't want to get myself in trouble. My brother always tells me that it's never worth getting angry over idiots on the road, but when i get into that state of anger i'm not myself, i can't even think straight.

It's difficult because as i said, 95% of the time i am a happy, stress-free individual, but once the switch has been flipped it becomes almost impossible to think rationally until the event is over and i have calmed down.

•Weirdly, I get mad over the simplest things, like a bad video game outcome, people not moving fast enough, dropping something on the floor, or mishandling anything at all - my head literally heats up and it’s like the hotter it gets, the less well I’m able to do whatever it is I’m doing, which makes me angrier.

"Hello, 

I’ve never posted on here before but here goes. Today, while I was staying with my best friend of 6 years, his indoor cat got into his backyard. I probably left the door open, I can’t remember. We tried to get him, but he fell into the yard behind the house. We go to the neighbor whose yard he fell in, that neighbor helps us out and gets him, but the cat escapes my friend’s girlfriend’s arms as she’s taking him back and climbs onto a fence divider and near to a tree. A neighbor stops by and asks if we need milk or anything to try to get him, but at this point I’m getting kind of angry—it’s been 15-20 minutes since he fell in, my friend and his girlfriend need to go to work, and I feel bad already for probably letting this cat out. 

So, I climb onto the fence, pushing him farther and farther back and he’s inching away from me, until he goes into a tree near the fence. Got him. I grab him out of the tree, lobbing angry obscenities at him “bastard, f**ker,” etc. because he’s being so much of a hassle; this must freak him out because now he’s clawing at me to get away. “Calm down or I’ll f**king kill you cat!!” I’m really not proud of writing that and it hurts to think about but that’s what I said. Now he’s ballistic, scratches up my face and arms and I’m struggling to hold onto him but he reaches up and gives me a great scratch across my jaw and I lose him; he runs off into the front yard. 

I hop the fence I was trying to take him through, practically screaming at him to “Get back here f**ker!!” (My best friend and his girlfriend looking on from the house over) and the cat runs into another neighbor’s yard and I lose sight of him. By this point, my friend and his girlfriend are leaving—“we have to go to work” etc. but it’s obvious they really just want to leave the situation and, probably, me. I walk away, starting to come down, and start to feel horrible. I get a text from my friend’s mom— “I hope you learn something from this.” I reply politely at first, then angrily, insisting that it wasn’t my fault that he got out in the first place—but she knows what happened. 

If I would’ve just taken a breath and let the cat chill on the fence by the tree until we got help, he would probably be safe right now. But I didn’t—he’s in some neighbor’s yard, we don’t know whose, possibly with dogs, or possibly uninhabited—we have no way to check, and I’m the only one here until 5. 

All in all, on the walk back to his house, I just felt sick—I couldn’t bear to even think about myself, couldn’t bear to think about listening to music, couldn’t do anything but just walk. When I got home, I texted his mom a bit more, and started to feel even more horrible as she laid out the consequences of my actions— “I forgive you, but the reality is that he may be lost forever and that will ripple through the whole family.” I’m reeling now, laying on the couch, feeling horrible, about to call my mom as I feel tears coming, but they just come to strong and I start sobbing, BAWLING, screaming into a nearby towel and flailing all about—I felt like a little child having the most horrible tantrum of his life. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me—I started looking for help on the walk home, but all I found were online anger management classes in my area. Do these work? Should i do it? Will this solve it? I just don’t know what to do—I’m still sitting here, I’ll probably just go put signs on the neighbor’s houses and hope for the best. If anyone has any insight or advice or anything, I would really appreciate it. I don’t know who to say sorry for and what—I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. 

Thanks for reading 

TLDR I lost my friend’s cat, took matters into my own hands and made things much worse by driving him into way more unknown territory and then had an emotional outburst alone after my friend left for work.",1
"I know the first step to solving any issue is to admit that you have a problem. I was hanging out with a friend and I was typing something down and he just kept staring at me. I kept telling him to stop and that it was bothering me. Next thing I know I have snapped and I am threatening to attack him with an upright vacuum cleaner. We made up, but this is serious. I need to get my anger under control before I hurt someone or something. What can you suggest that would help get this under control before it gets too bad?",1
"I just took a belt and snapped it at my father. My father gets drunk every night and comes home after work bad mouthing me and my mother. I felt so uncomfortable and fed up today and even though I know better, I threatened my father to go into his room and proceeded to snap my belt on the ground. I didn't do it psychically to him but I had to do it to assert myself. I used to hit my parents but because of time I've learned better and also because of the law. I feel like I'm a psychopath because when I was younger I took pleasure in inflicting pain on my father and till this day I still feel the urge to hurt an animal if I get too open. 

I know this is not the best way to deal with my anger but I feel like other people won't respect me and take me seriously unless I assert myself in a threatening way. Maybe I'm extremely self-conscious and have self-esteem issues but my parents should know that I'm not responsible for their relationship. I'm so quick to listen to others when they need help and give of myself, but don't take my kindness for granted. I genuinely feel alot of compassion for people but if you step my boundaries know that I will block you off.",1
I shut my friends out there is this one girl who gets it the worst i erase all of our messages delete her contact and block her number all she wants to do is help but i freak her out when she cant reach me for 5 days and she gets mad when i get mad cuz this random number is wanting to know if im alright i am probably just a little bitch,1
"I’m so tired of people taking advantage of me. I said something terrible to some guy who criticized me. I told him he was a fat middle aged fuck who deserved to blow his head off. I’ve been nice to everyone. Even when it hurt me to. I don’t give a fuck anymore. No one deserves my kindness, so ill now tell everyone off. If you say anything rude to me, I will use every bit of anger that I’ve bottled on for my whole life. Hopefully I don’t do anything I’ll regret....",1
"Not even sure where to start. This is more for me to try and get some clarification and to get my built up anger off my chest. 

So many little things these days fuel my anger. I tend to brush most things off, which usually ends up with me blowing up or overreacting at the smaller things. 

I'm 26 today, and still not sure what I want to do with my life. It bugs me to see my friends, siblings, younger people I know have a better picture with what they're doing with their life. I want to be happy for them, it just makes me feel like a piece of shit that I havent gone to college or have a decent job. My communication skills lack and my minds always clouded with negative thoughts. This causes me to drift in and out of focus when talking with people or just doing anything really. I thought about going to see the Doc, to try and get some adderall. At least use it to see if it can help get my life on track. I'm just not a fan of pills and the symptoms that can come with them.  

Currently also have a GF who says she wants to be with me, yet it doesn't feel that way most the time.  We are both deployed and have been together since we left (8 months). She's just always on her phone playing games or talking to her friends. I know she's not cheating, she does tell me when guys hit on her or when her ex tries to talk to her, so I do have that trust. We also haven't been intimate for far too long. It's not impossible on deployment to have sex, it's just she doesn't want to do anything if it involves sneaking into somewhere or bathrooms. So in that case it's pretty much a no go. I'm also part of the r/nofap community. I have been struggling giving up PMO. 6 days semi strong so far, which is right around the time I give in. Hoping this time is it. The few times my GF and I have been intimate I suffered from ED or not being able to last. She understood my frustration and said next time will be better. There hasn't been one since. All of this is also why I get so angry at myself and why I need to be successful at nofap. 

Going back to having a clouded mind, causes me to forget things easy, which stresses me out when I should remember simple things, which frustrates my GF, because now it seems like I don't listen to her. It's not on purpose, I just cant seem to focus longer than a few seconds. There's been times I've walked away in a middle of a conversation with friends because I lose interest or have lost track of the conversation. This is also part of the reason why I'm afraid to go to college. I'm afraid of failing and not being able to remember the subjects. 

I just want all this negative weight on my shoulders to be gone. I'm sick of not feeling good enough for anyone and having very little confidence in myself. I'm tired of constantly being stressed, scared and feeling like a disappointment. I want to be successful, happy and bring joy, instead of negativity to those around me.

"I woke up in a really bad mood this AM, &amp; I’ve been thinking really angry thoughts about my last job. I left it 6 months ago.

Maybe if I write it out I can get it out of my system, because I know it’s not healthy to hold onto old grudges.

When I left, none of the supervisors wished me good luck or even talked to me. I felt snubbed, because when other staff left they made a big deal &amp; gave them gifts, made sure everyone knew. Not even a private meeting or anything.

I’d been having trouble with 1 worker who harassed me for months, &amp; they did nothing about it. Another worker kept causing trouble for me, because pardon the French, she’s just a bitch.

I kept getting in trouble &amp; nobody appreciated anything I did. And the pay was very bad, &amp; I kept getting injured. I was so angry &amp; depressed, either I had to quit or I was going to end up hurting someone.

I don’t even feeling comfortable to visit the staff I like there, because there’s so many that (I interpret) don’t like me.

"I have just been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and was put on an anti depressant 20mg Lexapro.

I had a work function on this particular night and had not been warned about alcohol consumption and antidepressants. I had no idea what I was about to endure. The night started off fine with meeting and greeting work colleagues etc. I had 3-4 drinks and was feeling really blurred and not all there so I got one of my colleagues to walk me to the bathroom.

Apparently I had fallen and smashed the front of my face and back of my head really bad and had blood dipping down my face.
I was out cold. I do not remember being sick, hurting myself,  bleeding from the head or getting escorted out and put into a taxi to take me home, where I’d be safe. 

This was apparently at 9.30pm. Apparently I was sick in the taxi and became very violent when he tried to kick me out. I woke up in a jail cell. Where the police officer said I had been very violent and intoxicated. I had peed on the floor and vomited and was banging on the cell door for hours because I was in and out of consciousness. I literally thought I was either having a night mare from hell or is being held captive in an unknown where a-bouts by some fucking psychopath.

Finally at 2:30am I was discharged and on my way home absolutely frightened and a mess.

The next day I went to get up for work and fell straight on to the tiles, I had vomited all over myself. My partner had contacted my boss to inform him I was unfit to come back to work for a few days. When I finally was able to get out of bed, I looked at myself in the mirror and I had a smashed nose cuts and bruises everywhere and a black eye, my hands were swollen from punching the cell doors for hours the night before and were bright red.

I finally made it to the doctors by the second day and she had told me under no circumstances should you of been drinking on this medication and why I wasn’t informed by my previous doctor. 

When I took a beating the head due to falling I had given myself a concussion.

Work has called me and they were really great about it and are really concerned.

This is completely out of character for me and has left me feeling even more depressed and anxious, the day after the incident I have to admit I was feeling  what I would call suicidal.

I had locked my self in my bedroom for 3 days hardly ate or moved if I wasn’t sleeping I was crying, I had this sick gut wrenching feeling that takes over you and you can’t stop thinking about what has happened and if you are going to feel like this forever. 

I’m too scared to go out or drink alcohol ever again and this has really brought me down and has really scared me.

Can anyone give me advice or has anyone else been through a similar situation. How do I go back to a normal life.

All of my hard work on getting myself better had just done a 360 and I’m hating myself bad for what had happened. I just want to forget....",1
"My husband just went off on me for the third time in the last seven days. Each time I have tried to stay calm and tell him that I don't like the way he was talking to me.

I am tired of living like this."" Today husband pointed at the door and said, ""well get out then.""

He does therapy twice a month, the max we can afford, and he claims that he is working on managing his amger with the help of his counselor.

I really am tired if going through the cycle of heightened emotions and feeling victimized- I am no victim but I continue to feel like one in light of his shouting amd cussing at me.
My support system has dwindled away in the last few years since my parents passed away and I quit going to bars all of the time. I feel like my few relatives and friends that I can turn to are just tired of hearing the same shit from me and so I don't want to annoy them with these same problems over and over. I feel like I don't have anyone to turn to when this happens anymore. There I go, being the victim again. I hate this. I am so tired of it. I feel like he cares more about being angry than about how he is triggering me (abusive childhood) or the damage he is doing. I can't just leave, and we live in a small apartment so right now I am just hiding in the bathroom and crying. 
I just want a peaceful life. I just want to have a nice quiet Sunday.



Update: seems like nobody cares but I am in a terible state right now. I wish I felt like somebody gave a fuck. He started yelling and cussing at me again, this time in front of our daughter and I lost it. Another episode. Another set back. Why is this my life.",1
"I have ASD. Whenever I get hurt by anything, I hit at it, regardless of its intentions, if it indeed as any. I worry about what I'll hit and when. My sleep quality exacerbates this, but that's another topic for another time. 

How do I cope with this?",1
"I yell all the time about things.  Not exactly very loudly but with enough volume and tone to realize I'm angry.  When I'm at work this doesn't happen and when I'm in public is almost never happens.  However when I'm at home I have the shortest temper in the world.  Usually it's over things that aren't worth getting angry and yelling about.  This morning is a good example.  I came downstairs, made a cup of coffee, and was trying to look up some eye doctors since my insurance just started.  My girlfriend comes down and politely scolds me for not doing the dishes before I started doing anything else.  This is nothing to freak out over but it pissed me off and I started getting angry and swearing at her over it.  I should have just said she was right, been calm, and taken care of it.  Yet I responded with anger.  I do this all the time over simple situations like that.

Sorry for the rant but what are some good ways to try and prevent this from happening?",1
"I hate to admit it but I do have anger issues . I get pissed off pretty easily and want to take out my anger by hitting someone or something . It’s like a desire I can’t control where I just wanna hit something . Today I got into an argument with my mother and punched 3 holes in our living room wall . At the time it felt right . But now I just regret it and hate knowing I put my mom through so much . I said things I really didn’t mean , I don’t know how to stay calm . I don’t know what’s wrong with me ... I’m a real dickhead too .",1
"Right, so I have a whole potpourri of mental health issues and for that reason I don't want to work retail anymore. So I applied for a couple factory jobs. Some employers said that me not driving was an issue and that's fine. I understand that, makes sense, since these places are far away and commutes aren't too reliable. This one dude pissed me off though because 1) he kept calling me 'honey' in a very patronizing way. I'm not a crazy feminist, alright? I'm half-Bristolian, mind. People calling strangers stuff like 'love' 'lovely' 'honey' 'sweetheart' 'sweetie' 'dear' 'dearest', the list goes on, very creative bunch, doesn't upset me in the slightest because I do it myself. It was really what he said next that made me think it was patronizing 2) he said I wasn't strong enough for the job because it was heavy work. Carrying crates around. I'm 5'5/138lbs and not fucking weak at all. I felt so angry I couldn't really say much else and left soon after. I was shaking when I stepped outside and wanted to scream and throw myself face first onto a wall (like the guy in that vine, throwing himself onto some lockers lol). I carry all the groceries in at once. I have push-started cars with dead batteries MULTIPLE TIMES on my own, one of which on slanted street with the car facing upwards. If your problem is that I lack testosterone, let me pull my medical records out to change your mind. I have a similar condition to Caster Semenya, in case you're wondering, and no, they won't fucking make me take testosterone blockers. Sadly I'm not tall like her and look a lot more androgynous with a tendency to smile a lot, which is perceived as feminine for whatever fucking reason (one of the reasons why I don't want retail atm). Sorry for ranting. My question is if I have the right to be angry at this employer and think that the remark was kind of sexist.

Edit: to say that he said that just from looking at me, not from seeing me work, in case that wasn't clear.",1
"Sometimes, I get into a phase which makes me feel so emotionless. I feel like I became a different person.
I don't feel any feelings, it's not depression or something, I just really can't feel or understand emotions that time.
I manipulate everyone, it's also much easier for me to hurt others. Because no matter how close they are to me, once they are useless or annoy me I go all out on them. I can't control my anger. 
Everyone looks pathetic, it feels so easy to do things because I'm not working by emotions like them.
It happened to me first when I was in the 6th grade, I had enough of my teacher's behavior towards my class, so I decided to write to her a long message. The day after, she told me I made her cry all night and it felt like I made an accomplishment. She then told me to apologize, I told her ""I'm sorry"", when I saw she isn't moved by that, I faked tears and apologized, she just walked away. Then I thought to myself ""how pathetic"". 
After that, I had only moments when I felt this way. I just couldn't understand emotions. Last year (I'm 17 btw), I was like that for months.
Now it comes and goes. I can have a day full of that behavior or a day I behave normally.
Normally, I'm a really sensitive person, I'm nice to everyone and care for everyone. 
When I'm emotionless, I ignore other's pain, sometimes I ask myself why is it bad to hurt others, or what's so wrong with taking other's life. It's like I'm waiting for that opportunity, but once I get back to myself, I'm so shocked and afraid by those thoughts.
It's like I have too people in my head but it's not quite like that, I really don't know what to do, I just want to stop it and return to my normal self for the rest of my life.",1
"When my anger comes out it manifests in a completely explosive way. I'll never do harm to anyone or myself physically, but I become this monster that's capable of saying the exact words you need to hear to have your heart ripped from your chest and I hate it. I don't feel like it's able to be controlled in most cases. There's just this tipping point where it feels like the demon inside me won. I don't know what to do about it. I can't afford therapy and so I guess I'm coming to the internet for some nugget of advice that may help me get through it.",1
"I’m 15 and I can’t control my anger sometimes. 

I’ve gotten into the habit over the years of bottling things up, because I want to protect people. My aunt had a mental breakdown and went to jail then a mental hospital and my mom got her foot ran over that night and I didn’t cry once. I just turn whatever I’m supposed to feel into agitation then disregard it completely over and over and over again. 

Eventually though I’ll get set off, it’s usually something minor. Lost bike seat cover, messy room, rabbit pissed on your bed and everything comes hurling out to a point where I can’t control it. 

The worst one I let my frustrations out on a rabbit, I threw him against the wall , swung him by his neck, punched him, threw him in my saxophone kit and listened as he kicked then dumped him into his food bin  and poured water in closing the lid and listing to him kick and squirm to keep his head above water. All of this is troublesome but what worries me most is that I felt relieved when I did but then this crushing regret and remorse when I put him back in his cage and watched him shiver and wheeze trying to get water out of his nose.

 I still feel like I regret it but I think how it makes me feel is still bottled up because mentally I know it should tear me and how often it’s on my mind is evidence of that yet when I recall it and think about it even once ive been crying, tears dry up and I feel empty. 

I’ve hit shoved and punched my dogs, picked my kitten up by the head half hazzardly only realizing what I’d done once they were mid air and feeling badly afterwards, carved my doors with knives and even turned to self mutilation when these outbursts occur.

 What I’ve done to my animals already is horrendous but I’m afraid if I do it to people it will get much worse. All I can think about is having a dear friend, being in a bad mood, and having them do something minor that sets me off and I punch them or kick them or slam them against a wall. I don’t want that, I don’t want to hurt anyone or anything but I can’t stop. Please, how do I stop hurting things? I don’t want to be a monster.

Edit: just happened with the kitten again. I was giving him a flea bath, he wouldn’t sit still, and i impulsively squeezed him and slammed him down in the water. I’m giving them away. I can’t give up the dogs, even if I care for them most often they aren’t exactly MY dogs they are my parents and our black cat is my sister’s. The only two I can give up are the cats. Hope someone in the area can discretely pick them up. I hate this.",1

"I've been doing a good job of using meditation and relaxation techniques to manage my anger. I don't usually take my anger out on people but I realised a while back that I have a lot of pent up rage inside, stemming from bullying and mentally abusive friendships. I hold grudges and sometimes I just can't let it go. I practice mindfulness and I use phone apps and self-help books to obtain peacefulness, but there are times I can't control how I feel. 

Today I punched a wall twice after an argument with my Dad. I'd spent 5 hours today searching for jobs which is proving very difficult. It's annoying when you're at home people think you're doing nothing all day which isn't the case with me, which of course made me really angry. After punching the wall and crying for the first time in a long time, I used my breathing techniques and calmed myself down. It's so much more effective than holding it in and crying or hurting yourself. It's been a long time since I self-harmed but arguments like the one today often gives me the urge, but today I used my techniques and now feel better. 

Just thought I'd share! What else do you guys do to control your anger?",1
"Wondering if anyone else experiences this, when someone (family or otherwise) wakes you up rudely or demands something of you unjustified so you finally have a target to destroy using facts and logic even if it's in an angry raging tone. And then afterwards realising you enjoyed it

"Whenever people tell me I'm wrong I get really really angry. It flares from 0-100 before I have time to think. It depends on how people do it of course, but usually when you've done something wrong or messed something up people yell at you. So, what do I do to stop this anger? I've been trying to meditate and that helps with some anger. I've tried looking into the source of the anger (I'm pretty sure if comes from a fear of embarrassment or letting people down), but that hasn't seemed to help so far. I can rationalize it and that helps afterwards but I still explode into an angry mess every time.

"Just a heads up i would never hurt a family member or friend of mine. 

So 2 days ago i got so angry, that i punched my table until i felt extreme pain and when i looked i saw that it was bleeding. Immediately drove to the hospital and now i need surgery for my finger.

It was because my mother kept making me angry, screaming at me and hitting my head and instead of punching her i punched the table, which is a fair imo but she still seems to be mad at me, although im the one who has a plaster on his arm. Whatever. 

It's insane how angry i get sometimes.

For example, my friends have been out 2 times on 2 different occasions and im so angry at them, because i invite them to everything whenever i do something. Nowadays i keep having the though ""fuck em all just chill by yourself until you move out and have a new and better life"" but i like these people, but they make me so angry sometimes that i want to remove them completely from my life.

"Hi all! I am looking for some self help books that would appeal to my father.

He has openly said to me that he wants to work on his anger problems because 1) he noticed he gets very angry over things he thinks he shouldn't be and 2) he has recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure and has reached incredibly dangerous levels due to his anger. 

He asked me about a pill that would make him ""chill out"" and is looking into CBD as an option. He takes a high blood pressure medication but he says it does not help him when he is angry. I suggested therapy and he considered that it could be helpful but doesn't think he's ""that bad"" to the point where he ""needs it."" He didn't ask for a self help book, but I think if I gave it to him that he would use it and it could help him.

\-lives with wife (50), and two sons (16 &amp; 7)

I’ve been spending more time alone than usual due to a breakup. At first I felt very angry but not anymore. I mostly feel pretty numb at this point to sum it up. I’ve been really trying to take this time to improve myself. I went out to get a book on anger after spending hours looking for a therapist who takes my insurance and ended up with nothing. 
It’s called “Never Get Angry Again” by David Lieberman. I am almost halfway done and it has already given me so much clarity and recommendations to help unravel why I am feeling so angry. He goes in depth to expose where the anger is coming from and how to use practices to get it under control before another outburst happens. If anyone has had a not good experience with therapists or just like reading I 10/10 recommend this book .",1

"Recently I was forced to visit a psych ward after I was threatened to be kicked out of the home. During this time:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Before the ward when I visited the hospital, my parents lied to the doctors flat out saying I was going to kill myself after we agreed on something different previously. They then told me to figure out my life myself when I told the doctor that was untrue and eventually asked them to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My mother texted multiple people including her friends about the incident. I was given visual proof but cannot reveal the giver of this info.-My aunt texted me halfway through my stay I saw when I saw my phone. Telling me a bunch of stuff about how she's dissapointed in me and that I'm the problem. I had called her about 7-10 times at different times of the day and she didn't pick up and claimed she tried calling on my first or second day but that they said ""I wasn't there"", whichever crazy/schizophrenic person picked up the phone that is.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My aunt, mother, and other aunt all conspired together to send me books anonymously on Asperger's Syndrome. My aunt's 16 year old son told me this when I saw him in person, and I figured out it was my aunt by asking an Amazon representative saying I was being harassed and that I wanted to know the first name of whoever sent the package to me.-My mother tried to hide the second book that was mailed to me as a gift  in her room becuase she knew I was returning the first one for gift card money on Amazon. She did so until I expressed concern that Amazon told me I had another book that should have arrived the day before as well, and I searched for the book and asked both my parents about it and they said it never arrived and that they didn't know about a package being sent to me. It magically appeared in my room,  after I told my father I was going to wait a few days and go file a police report at the police station saying someone was stealing our mail from our mailbox because we've had a thief or two steal from our property before and I said I was concerned about them stealing again or trying to break in.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My mother claimed to the police I threatened her when the police were called by holding a bucket over my head, the day they were called. This actually happened and was recorded about a week earlier on her cell phone, with another overhead camera in the room. She claimed she 'started recording too late' and 'forgot to turn on the other camera'. She was supposed to be my ride to work and bailed on me because there were a few items in the corner of my bed even though my room was completely clean: a game console that' s always there, my backpack, and a pair of shorts - and I had to show up late and got written up at work over it, I was forced to call an uber.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My father promised me when agreeing upon entering the psychiatric hospital that he would suggest he thought the Klonopin I was on was helping me. Now my dose has been lowered because they're afraid for my safety. It was working super well for my years of anxiety attacks. I was a shy kid and it slowly developed into severe anxiety, it runs in my family. I have two grandmothers and 3 cousins with anxiety attacks. Now I'm still shaking and randomly getting nervous on the lower dosage. I was fine and functioning like a normal human on the higher dose.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I threatened my parents with calling child protective services to report the two times they hit my brother, dragged my sister across a parking lot, and threw me up against a wall by my neck, because my father and mother wouldn't agree to go down to the police station and take back what they said about me holding a bucket over my head like I was going to hit my mother with it. I don't want acts of violence on my record. They said no so I said I was going to call, and my father said ""Fine, go ahead"". My mother then texted all her friends telling them that I told  CPS they don't feed their children and beat them regularly (That isn't what happened, and she wasn't even there for the phone call. My father was. Again, I have visual proof of all this. An anonymous informant gave me pictures of her texts)

&amp;#x200B;

\-My parents agreed before the meeting with my psychiatrist that they wouldn't mention an Asperger's diagnosis I got at 6 , which turned out to be just me being shy and having poor social skills, that another quack of a 90 year old man agreed with so he could have appointments talking to me about random shit and get paid for it twice a week. They claimed I took some kind of test to prove it. I clearly remember him telling me the test didn't matter for anything and it was for fun, so I just rushed through some written test where you circled answers and afterwards he said ""Yup, I agree with the previous doctor's opinion. He definitely has asperger's syndrome"" (I've  never needed help in school nor have I ever had trouble securing a job, doing well in school, reading body language, reading nonverbal communication, reading tone, having poor periphial vision/motor skills. ) So my parents like to tell evreyone I'm mentally challeneged while treating me like a normal person that they've kicked out on the streets when I was 18 before and stolen my money/possessions from me about 10 times.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I invited my 17 year old brother to my psych appointment as my alibi to speak on my behalf (I never got to speak to my psych with just my brother) because he sees the stuff my parents do and what I do versus what my parents claim they do and I do. He only got to speak one word. My mother didn't expect that I was bringing my brother and was freaking out. I said ""Isn't this supposed to be a family meeting? He's almost an adult and part of the family"" and I saw her texting her sisters saying ""I just want to drop jilted007 off at a homeless shelter right now.""

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

My cousin revealed personal information I DM'd to her out of confidence when asking me what was wrong after a facebook post she was concerned about, and then told our whole family. This was the same cousin that was laughing the whole time at my grandpa's funeral. I asked her not to talk to me anymore.

My grandmother's daughter (my aunt) sent a group text to my mother and my grandmother of one of my facebook statuses saying ""i wish I could trust the people I loved more."" I asked my grandmother if she knew who was sharing my facebook statuses with other people and that I only had 12 friends because it was my family account. She claimed she had no idea. She was included in the group text! I couldn't believe she could lie to me so easily, but I guess she used to be a big manager at a company I won't name after being really good in sales so she was probably used to lying to her employees to cut costs and increase profits so that she'd get bigger bonuses. I'm pretty sure she even admitted she'd cut her employees hours so that she could make more money in a recent conversation to me, I can't remember exactly how she said it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at the point where I'm ready to blow, and if I get in conflict with my parents again they're just going to kick me out. So I just have to keep bowing down and eating their shit if I want a place to stay and rides to my job 10 minutes down the street until I find a job that allows me to move out. They got my medication taken away. My mom has put a great effort into trash talking me to everyone else in our family, and my father goes along with it because he's a cuck and does whatever my mom wants/agrees with whatever she says, 90-95% of the time. I already blew up at my psych via text telling her she's taking my parent's words as the holy scripture from our family meeting and that I barely got to talk, they just told her a bunch of crap and she'd ask me if I would agree with it and I'd ask my family ""Am I supposed to agree with what you said , or am I going to get kicked out if I don't, or can I talk about this privately after we talk as a group with her"" to 99% of the stuff they said.",1
"My mother is my biggest trigger and whenever I feel extremely angered by her, I just want to punch her and hit her. I used to hit her but fortunately I'm older now and know better enough to not act like that anymore.   
I have horrible anger management and I've realized this for the longest time now. Even though I don't get aggressive anymore, I repress my anger and pretend to be nice until I obsess. It got so bad recently that I held my mom's dog in my hand and it was wriggling as if it got mad at me. My mom looked at me like I had harmed it. Even though I was holding my dog carefully and it was probably hoping to sit down, I was so tempted to just show my dog against the ground and yell it was because of my mother.  I don't know what to do anymore. What do you guys do to alleviate such anger?   
I'm unable to move out right now due to financial reasons and I just don't know how I can deal with my anger.",1
"I'm curious to see the methods people use to battle their angry side. I've found myself being a more angry person than I used to me and sometimes for bo apparent reason. I dont want to be like that and I'm consciously trying to be better at it. So my question to you is, what do you do to calm yourself when you get angry?",1
"I used to feel angry all the time during middle school. At little things and big things. I would get worked up and aggressive, but I learned how control myself when I was angry and channel it into making myself stronger and better. All I wished for during that time was be in high school where I could sports that would really allow me to take my anger out on something real. However, when I finally got to high school, I couldn't feel the anger I used to feel with the adrenaline pumping through my veins. I have no more actual drive to push myself now. I'm still determined to get better, but without anger everything feels much harder. I can still sound angry all the words and phrases are there, but I put the same amount of emotion behind them. How do I feel angry again?",1
"Sorry, this is a long one...

Hey, this is my first time posting so please let me know if this isn’t the right place. I’m a 24 year old guy, and I’ve never really considered myself as having an anger problem. Over the past year or so though, I’ve started getting angry at my partner (f22) for really irrational reasons. Like the most recent issue we had (which started in an absolutely ridiculous way) came about because I want to start feeding my cat a raw/supplement diet like I used to with my dog and she expressed concern and asked if I knew all the risk or if it was safe. I haven’t done a ton of research but I’m getting the supplements from a reliable source and I didn’t really have any concern. She said she wanted to google it and got out her phone, and for some insane reason I took that as an attack. Did she think I was a shitty cat owner? Does she think I’m an asshole? Does she think I’m stupid? All these stupid thoughts that had nothing to do with what she said AT ALL. I get that the reason I got angry is because I perceived a threat, but WHY? Why does this sort of stuff get me on the defensive and make me SO angry? I’m just not sure what to do. If anyone has any experience with this or any advice or resources I’m super open to it (which I understand is ironic because in this situation I got angry because my partner was trying to give me resources and information). I’m just sick of being angry and I’m sick of hurting her, it isn’t fair on her.

Thanks.",1

Has anyone ever experienced getting angrier when they are depressed? I am nervous to reach out to anyone for therapy or help. i don’t want there to be something actually wrong with me even though it feels that way all the time. I just want to pull myself out of whatever hole i’ve dug. i ruined my relationship with my boyfriend because of insecurities &amp; mistakes i made out of anger. it’s like i can’t control myself. now i feel 10 times angrier and sadder than before. Not being able to control my anger and impulses has resulted in me being absolutely alone. i guess that’s why i’m writing here since i don’t think anyone else cares to listen to me.,1

When I feel like this I hate talking to people, music/movies aren’t  enjoyable, I feel tired and annoyed, etc. etc. Anybody feel this way? Any tips to pull yourself out??",1
"I get into screaming matches with my family a lot.
Most of the time I feel irritated with comments they make and tend to shut down or get defensive. With my bf and friends I'm defensive with a few fights (usually after talking things out). I used to keep my anger under control but the past few years it gets worse and worse. It's like something eating me on the inside and I cant seem to stop it. I always have to have the last word, or feel like I'm treated like a child. I'm a 23 year old adult and my phone is being taken by my family for a whole month (they dont pay for it). I'm frustrated with myself and everything around me. I cant seem to stop feeling irritated or angry all the time.

I'm sorry about the rant, and if it doesnt make sense. I cant keep my emotions in check and everything is just kinda spilling out.

Edit: I guess I should have mentioned I've moved out before a few times. I've only been back here for 3 weeks constantly looking for work and cleaning the house for them. And despite my obvious efforts it hasn't been enough. My dad gave my mom an ultimatum where either he does things his way or he leaves and so his way is taking stuff from me, hindering the job search.",1
"This is my first reddit post but I can't really find much else on the topic i have

Relevant information I guess being that I'm 16, and im ftm trans

(I started hrt back in february.)

&amp;#x200B;

During the first few week (on testosterone) I really noticed that little things would tick me off. My endocrinologist would tell me about having a bit of a temper during hrt but nothing that dramatic.

I'm in an alt program just off the main school and just finished up grade 11 a few weeks ago.

The teachers are a bit pushy but I guess that's normal for being in the program. After breaks and stuff they'd come in and repeatedly tell people to get to class. This would just rub on me the wrong way, something about a staff's voice or how they'd keep calling my name even as I'm getting ready to get up would piss me off a lot. I'd find myself swearing under my breath or like making offhand comments but after another month or so it would stop being so annoying.

That's just an example. When people pry or social workers or even my counselor would ask the wrong question I used to just shut down. I'd always get mouthy with teachers and was a pretty emotional kid but now it's just getting worse. My adopted parents would be super strict about me talking back and always preached about having respect for parents and elders and punishing me whenever I got angry back. I'm sorta just expected to sit there and take whatever they wanna say, especially with my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

My \[adopted\]dad has his own anger issues, and often has tantrums and goes yelling around the house. I think it's stupid, and I've always seen anger as petty and childish because of him. And now I just feel like I'm following in his footsteps.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier today I just couldn't shake the *\[really violent\]* feeling of wanting to destroy something or someone. I started swearing at a S.O \[long distance\] over discord and and now I just feel embarrassment and shame and pissed off and I wanna screaaaaam. I'm trying to downplay it and I've apologized to my s.o and tried to explain a bit but I feel like they're gonna be weird about it. 

Usually it goes away quicker and it always leaves me exhausted and I hate feeling this way. Like I said previously, I always see anger as something I should be better than but obviously it's not working lol

&amp;#x200B;

I just some help I guess. Coping strategies or things I can do to calm myself down.  I'm gonna try and talk to my counselor about it next time i see her but there's already a lot going on and idk it feels weird because she always seems to look at me differently afterwards.",1
"Someone was behind me in a movie theater last night and wouldn’t shut up. He also had his watch’s alarm ring every five minutes. I looked back at him and he said “Say something I fucking dare you” to which I gave him my ‘do not fucking push me’ and responded “It rings every 5 minutes.” 

He shut his mouth and instantly quieted his watch but I genuinely wanted to fight him. 

Why does this have to happen? He fixed his behavior, so why do I still feel angry 12 hours later? I had to fucking rewrite this post several times so it didn’t include descriptions of violence.

Anger sucks and I wish I couldn’t feel it.",1
When i get angry not only does it feel like i lose control of myself it also feels like I can never pull myself out of it. I get so upset and angry at the smallest things that most people would bush over. When it comes to feelings i’m quick to get angry and frustrated when trying to express them. I never know how to express other “not good” emotions and they all form together and add to my frustration. My anger issues have ruined many relationships that i values that i will never get back. I end up feeling so guilty with myself for things i’ve done out of anger. I want the self hatred to stop and to be able to fix myself to be a less angry person. Does anyone else feel like they lose control of themselves when they get angry ? What helps to stop when it’s happening ?,1

A guy who puts others down for being themselves all because he's a narcissistic prick all the time.

A guy who curses out his mother because he can't buy a fucking video game or next awesome looking thing on the internet.

A guy who judges others yet is afraid of judgement.

He says he hates being around us that he hates this place, then why can't he do the world a huge deal and go jump the fuck of a bridge and die away from me and my mom in a super deep trench with his head still stuck up his ass. This fucker won't do anything but complain and I'm so sick of it.

"LOng read sorry 

I never seen myself as an angry person. I never had issues with previous exs other than one where my anger would get thr better of me. 

Recently I started to have less patience with my girlfriend. She started mentioning that once I get upset it's the same as a drunk man blacking out. On two occasions I lost it and snapped at her.

The first time was the drive to meet her father(on fathers day). We been fighting for that entire weekend. After so much fighting I lose it and start barking uncontrollably saying cruel and hateful things. I always say she instigates fights and she agrees but the no control I have and the look I give her when I'm mad makes her afraid of me


Just Saturday. We had another massive fight. Over something so silly. It was a tear jerker video of some sob story for someone on a show America's got talent. 

I told her I dont care for that stuff and went on my phone. She complained and made me watch. I did and went back on my phone. I explained again how much indont care for these tear jerkers. And went back on my phone and she got upset. During her complaints I said fine I'll listen to his performance since he was a musician. She refused and said I need to watch It at the hotel.

This is where I start to argue. (Anger lv1) saying how it's silly that I have to watch it when hes a musician playing an instrument. I should be able to listen fine but she has to have it her way. I made the compromise but she wouldn't. 

When we got to the hotel she went to sign us in and when she returned she gave me 2 choices. 

I can either 
A. Calm down and watch the movie. Or 
B go home and forget the hotel entirely. 

Added note I paid for this hotel with the no money I had since I was against it. I didn't want to burn 150 dollars for 1 night just to sleep when we can just drive home .

Anger lv 2. When she gave me that ultimatum I lost it. I was so pissed off. All this for a silly video that I kept saying I dont care for. We start arguing more. I said ok lwts talk about it. We wont. With her we never talk about the original issue. It has to be everything after and leave the original out. So me being mad is an issue to discuss and it takes soooo damn long for her to talk. I feel when she takes her time it's her way of changing the story and situation to make her look like she was right and the victim. She always plays this game m.

Everythully I went to bed and when I was asleep her dog was barking and I got upset. I really dont know I'm just taking her word for it. She said shes going out and she got mad at me for not protecting her and being alerted for being out at a strange place. Again I'm 1/2 and said take.the dog with you. She apparently was really mad at this. Later that night I tried to engage in sex.... this frightens me because I had no idea I did any of this.
Day goes by were still fighting. We calm down and I'm apologizing for how I am.... 

She never has to because I always misinterpret what she does to get upset. Apparently she said the wrong thin when she gave the ultimatum. The usual...


Anyway anyone can give advise on how to just get out of the really anger zone and back to rationality.",1

My daughter who is 8 is starting to realize I’m a complete ass and i tell her not to hate me because i yell, I just don’t know how to control my anger.

So last night my boys run downstairs and my youngest has gum in his hair, fun. So my oldest boy is trying to explain what happened and I just freak out. It’s never physical, I just got so mad that they were screwing around and gum got into his brothers hair. I washed it out, no harm, no foul. I then held my boys for a good 5-10 minutes while they cried telling them i was so sorry for yelling and I shouldnt have. I’m completely apologetic after I get upset. I dont want them to think of me that way, i tell them i love them more than anything in the world. I’m so scared that It will effect them as they grow. 

What can I do to fix this? I’m so at a loss as it’s not everyday. I need to control this, but am unsure how. Please help.

"Hi everyone
I have a 10 year old nephew who I’m very close to. He comes from a stable close-knit family. From the age of around 5 people very close to him started leaving for extended period of times (from a few months to a year away) his grand parents, sometimes his parents, aunties and uncles etc. I think this is the root cause of his anxiety and anger.

We’re enrolling him for martial arts starting next week to use up his energy, but is there anything else I can do? I’m asking because in a month, his mother will also be traveling for a few weeks for work and I’m worried that he’ll be completely unmanageable.",1
"I've told my backstory in some more length in some comments in this sub, so I won't go into a ton of detail here.

&amp;#x200B;

the tl;dr version is, marriage was wracked with my anger issues, mutual anxiety and depression, and failing communication. My wife left me and took the kids after an eleven year relationship (and almost made it to our ten year wedding anniversary).

&amp;#x200B;

If you suffer from anger issues like me, then I know that you can feel a physical change in your body when you're starting to get riled up about something. For me, my breathe quickens, my heart races, and I can feel all the muscles in my upper torso start to tense up. I've also been told that I blink rapidly.

&amp;#x200B;

So, yesterday, I was on the phone with some one, and they weren't getting what I was saying, and it was really frustrating me. I started to feel like I wasn't being listened to, or was being ignored, and because I suffer from many narcissistic tendencies, I took this as a personal attack against me. Shortly after that I found the familiar rush of faster breathing and heart rate, and my arms and chest tensing up like I was ready to throw a punch (this person was on the phone miles away and there were no other people near me and I had no desire to hit anyone, nor did I ever become violent when my anger got the better of me)  - and then something strange/uncomfortable/wonderful happened:

&amp;#x200B;

I suddenly got stage fright.

&amp;#x200B;

*Stage fright.*         \[Edited to clarify that the stage fright doesn't feel panicky, just embarrassing\] 

&amp;#x200B;

Why? No one was around, and the person I was talking to couldn't see any of the things happening to my body that my anger was triggering. As best I can tell, after losing my family I am now so averse to allowing myself to get angry that on some level I kind of ""caught myself"" getting angry, and just realized that I was about to get angry again.

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped talking, took a deep breath, and just listened.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, even though I didn't agree with what the person was saying, I practiced some **empathy** and validated the person's right to their opinion by conceding that (even though I didn't agree) that their suggestion was totally possible. Instead of saying ""yeah but"" or ""you're not listening"" I instead said ""yeah, and in addition to that..."". Using this **and in addition** phraseology is a better way to 1) validate the other person's input/opinion and 2) add your own input/opinion without invalidating the other person's input/opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I performed two reps of the calming **breathing exercise** that my therapist taught me (I started therapy almost as soon as my family left - I didn't realize that my un-resolved issues were causing everyone else distress and I didn't want to be a bad guy anymore). The breathing exercise really calmed me down the rest of the way. Heart rate and breathing went back to normal, muscles relaxed, and I was able to engage in a more productive conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

After the breathing exercise, the next thing that I practiced is something called **the observer self**. Basically, as some one with strong narcissistic tendencies, I'm really bad at seeing things from other people's point of view, even though I thought I was really good at it. So what I do instead is try and look at the situation from a third party point of view. I imagined - I kid you not - Alex Trebek standing next to me dressed in a suit and tie listening to both sides of the conversation. Would he think that the person I was talking to had a valid point? Yes. Would he think I had a valid point? Yes. Would he think me getting all worked up over something like that was ridiculous? Absolutely!

&amp;#x200B;

Then a few hours later on the phone with some one else it happened again and I was able to use the same steps as above with great success.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's it. The trauma of my marriage ending 90% due to my angry outbursts conditioned me to catch myself getting angry. I'm learning and practicing empathy, breathing exercises, and looking at things from another perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could say that I'm a happy camper now, but the cold reality is that today, like every day the past month, when I get home, the house is going to be empty. My wife/BFFF won't be there to tell me she missed me and is glad I'm home. My kids aren't going to yell ""Daddy!"" and come running to give me hugs. So something I need to reiterate over and over again is that if anger is messing up your life, it's surely messing up the lives of the people around you too. For their sake, and for yours, get some help before you wind up like me.",1
"Today my mom said I should start a groupchat with a bunch of friends and ask if anyone wants to go to some local Con that's happening- It's a small, little thing.

Most of the time it's like I think of what I want to say to someone, but it ends up coming out the wrong way when I speak it.  I feel so alone most of the time like there is no one who I can talk to or that even wants to talk to me.  I feel like I'm always being someone else's friend to them but nothing in return.",1
"I'm 16f and i don't know if this is just me being a teenager or something else more personal. Whenever a conversation comes up with my mother where she gets disappointed in me or mad at me, I begin to get even more upset at her. 

Recently I was in a situation where she didn't trust my friend whose been my friend for so many years and she's never trusted my friend. My friend has had a reputation for speaking her mind a little too much and expressing her anger. my mom doesn't trust her being friends with me but tbh i am one of the best teenagers out there who are absolutely innocent, i don't vape/smoke, do drugs, sex, whatever bad it is that parents think is terrible. I don't have a massive amt. of friends, and the friends i do have i trust truly. however, my mom doesn't trust this friend, lets call her Sarah. So my mom doesn't like Sarah because she's created a bad rep but in the past 2 years, she's changed IMMENSELY. my mom keeps thinking about the things that Sarah did 2+ years ago and she thinks if i keep hanging out with her, i'll gain that bad rep too and even though she says she trusts me with my choices. 

my mom is an immigrant but has pretty good english. i just blow up on my mom bc i keep telling her that sarah has changed but she always repeats the points that she makes and never takes time to understand what i'm trying to explain. she always yell at me about how i exaggerate my motions and i start to point at her and just be overall dramatic and at this point, i'm practically screaming at her because she doesn't understand me. this has gone on for years and i every time i get angry, i try to explain peacefully but i end up making these exaggerated motions like it just can't be contained in my control. why do i blow up like this and become so dramatic?",1

"Today I had lunch at a buffet for a family friend's mother's 80th birthday party. 

A lady was sitting next to me at the table was eating crab legs, and cracked open a crab leg, and got some of the juice on me. I totally flipped out. I started saying rude things, and then rudely asked her to move somewhere else. After asking her a few times, she finally got up and moved elsewhere. For a moment, I felt like I was in control, and I had the power. And then a bit later, the guilt set in. I felt terrible about how poorly I treated this woman, who seemed to be a rather generous, kind hearted person. After being a bit too shy to apologize, I finally did, and she appreciated the apology. I even gave her a hug (as my family friend insisted). 


I still feel rather awful about this, and hope to work on this with my therapist. I am generally not an angry person, but it can be explosive when I get angry. I hope to get things under control.",1
"Not currently angry at the moment nor am i too frequently to warrent even being on this sub however...

Does anyone else fantasise about the idea of someone picking on you just so you can release your animalistic rage on them?

Like i sometimes picture someone starting on me just for me to go into a rage and pick them up using rage strength, eating them like an animal and slamming them against a brick wall.

I never will give into these feelings however and most times just defuse any fight situations before they escalate not because im scared but because i don't want a tarnished reputation, worried i'll go to far and go to prison and i just dont wanna be hurt and go hospital if anything went wrong, theres just to much at stake with a fight and in the whole grand scheme of things isn't worth it if you can avoid it.

Doing all these things aren't really 'fantasies' as you can physically do these things anyway especially when in a state of rage fueled with adrenaline, fun idea to play around with, anyone else get these scenes play out in their head? I find them a safe way to release any anger i do have however it sometimes can work me up to wanting a fight although this is rarer.",1
"I mean intense, but short, anger bursts. Just enough where you can let off your steam and then everything is fine. Is this normal?

"I recently understood that I have a lot of anger inside myself and, being an introvert, for me is difficult to express what I feel to other people so I decided to make a post here.

My grandma is the cause of a part of my anger. I'm now living with her since 2016 and in the beginning it seemed like she was the nicest person on earth. With time passing I discovered her paranoia and all her really, really bad habits. Several times I tried discussing with her about things she was doing in the wrong way, but she always responded that I was the one who was wrong and after that she wold just be angry with me for the rest of the day.
I tried ignoring all this for a LOT of time but now I really can't stand it anymore. Now everyday seems like hell to me. Every fucking morning I wake up and I know I'll have to listen to all her bullshit about how ""our neighbors turn off our electricity during the night because they hate her"" and things like that.
But I can't just simply scream at her every fucking time because I would only worsen the situation.
I really don't know what to do.",1
I’ve been talking to my therapist and we started discussing what I’m getting out of anger? Some amount of control? Some feeling of ‘better than’ I don’t understand and I’m just trying to start a discussion. Have a good day.,1
"Hello, I'm kinda drunk right now, so please forgive me if the text is kinda messy. I hope this fits here as well.

Ever since I was a child I felt an unnatural amount of anger, which could also happen very quickly and randomly. I didn't just get angry at someone, I **obsessed** over them and my anger at them for as long as I was around that person in some capacity, which especially was an issue in school of course. Almost always I would avoid letting this anger out though, but instead just bottle it up inside me. Even now, when some stranger on the street is being a dick to me I obsess over it for years, even though the amount of anger I feel at situations like this is completely inappropriate to the situation. 

Right now my situation is that I'm living with two roommates. With one I've been living together for 2 years now and we're good friends and there was a time it was only the 2 of us and it was always pretty chill. We could talk to each other just fine about issues and were always on good terms, but the other roommate I absolutely despise. I don't even wanna go into the details of it, but it's gotten to a point where even the way he *talks* drives up a wall. Normally, I try to be respectful regardless and talk to him calmly, and worst of all whenever I got drunk with my other roommate I'd be nice to him (I'm a cheerful drunk), so obviously he doesn't even really understand why I despise him all of a sudden. There were times where he was genuinely acting like a complete asshole, but when he halfheartedly apologized I stupidly pretended to be okay with that, even though that even now I'm still seething over it.

It's gotten to a point where I either spend time at my parents' place who live in a different city, where I often feel pretty shitty as well or here in my flat, but this situation with him feels so anxiety and anger inducing that I feel like I can't take this much longer. It feels like there is no space to return where I'm not confronted with something that makes me either extremely angry or absolutely loathe myself. The past few days I feel like I finally broke and I just can't keep this facade up anymore. Today we had some stupid fight over completely meaningless shit and the only way I feel able to cope with this dumb shit is to drink until I feel placated, but it's no good in the long term, because I obviously shouldn't get drunk like this as long as he lives here and I won't be able to move out until 2 or 3 months or so.

I also suspect I might suffer from depression, due to constant feelings of emptiness and intense self-hatred, but the anger is obviously another thing that gets to me. I constantly think about killing myself (not just because of him), but don't want to upset my parents, and then I also obsessively think about beating the shit out of my roommate (or worse), which really is nothing but an immature power fantasy and I don't want fuck my life up. I honestly think all of this anger stems from feelings of insecurity or something, but the anger I feel is there regardless and I feel like there is a tornado going on in me and it drives me crazy. I want to get this anger out, but can't in a productive manner. There is all this extremely intense and obsessive anger in me, and I feel like I'm cracking apart. Most of this anger isn't even justified, fuck. I'm so fucking pathetic.",1
I’m filled with rage at the moment. My blood is boiling. I want no more than to punch the living shit out of something until it breaks. I’ve never felt this angry before. The slow breathing methods and other ways to cope don’t satisfy the feeling I have inside of me. Punching my bed and pillow don’t give me the breaking satisfaction that I want so badly. I don’t want it to end until I’m satisfied. Help me,1
"I’ve been realizing more and more that I’m an absolute terrible person in the morning, usually until 11 or so. I wake up dreading going to work, snap at my boyfriend, lay in bed until the absolute last minute, and generally hate any form of human interaction for a good 4 or so hours after waking. I’m really worried because I’ve been really snappy and short at my coworkers in the morning recently, mostly because I found out that I didn’t get a job interview I had really been banking on a couple of days ago. 

But even since before then, for some reason, every time someone comes over to my desk in the morning to chat or whatever, I just get so annoyed at them, like they’re wasting my time, and start thinking that everything they’re saying is stupid and inconsequential, and no matter how hard I try to pay attention and not get angry I just start getting so annoyed and frustrated to the point of making really short, angry comments. I don’t want to push my coworkers away, as they’re the only part of my job that I enjoy. Even worse, I don’t want to push my boyfriend away, either. Any helpful advice with dealing with morning anger would be much appreciated.",1
"A lot of times I get angry at my brother for the littlest things. I used to scream at him and get into violent fits of rage but obviously as I grew older I have learned to calm down. Although I do not have violent episodes, I still feel the same feelings inside. I have not done anything to damage our relationship yet. However I have been talking with some friends recently and they said that I get angry a lot and have some anger management issues. Specifically towards my brother. A lot of the times I don’t even notice it or I don’t see it as they do. How do I try and control my emotions for the sake of my family and friends?",1
"

Honestly I'm not an explosive volcanic person as I used to be during a child I still have moments of anger especially in the mornings or when I stayed up all night (have problems putting down phone hyperfocus mostly.) 

The only time my anger really turns up is when it's that time and becomes extremely difficult to control during and before.. My therapist did come up with a way to control my anger by doing the opposite but I mostly forget about this method. 

I was wondering if a punching bag works cause when I get angry I build up alot of energy in my arms and it makes me almost hit people and I hate this, what I wanted to do was divert all the energy out of these limbs.

 I am not a violent and hateful person, how I was raised mostly.  I hear people imagine who they want to punch or put a picture on the punching bag. I hate violence and it makes me scared when I want to hit someone.

I really hate this about myself, it makes me sick, and it makes me avoid a loving and meaningful relationship with someone cause I'm scared I might hurt them or push them away and lose them.

Since there is too much built upenergy and stress in my l arms  I want  to find a way to relieve this part of me, by basically not punching a victim out but just relieving all tension and energy in something that I see as excersise, not someone to punch. I like this cause I think it might direct all this built up tension and energy but I'm not sure cause I haven't bought a punching bag ever so I don't if science does not back this up.

 I feel when I'm about to hit someone I can actually feel the energy building up in arms it is extremely diffcult and I try as hard as I can not to hit someone.  I  almost hit someone in store yesterday not exactly a very good idea.

I can't excersise anything below the legs cause I hurt my knee badly so I am looking for something to use with my arms if punching bags don't work anything else that might help is great.

I also have problems with being snippy and when I angry I won't watch what I say any pointers how to prevent this would be helpful it tend to push people away from me.

It will also help if I might get some tips for these hitting situations especially when I am not at home and am shopping or doing something else. Mostly my anger is caused by my bipolar disorder so any help that surrounds that will help me greatly. 

I don't know if there is any help for the anger spectrum of bipolar specifically. (I already take meds so I don't need the info on that for bipolar.)

This post may have typos I have been awake for 29 hrs and honestly can not focus on anything right now. I may have also repeated myself alot because in this state I forget easily. I'm going to bed and imma going check this tommorow. Good night y'all.",1
"I spent a lot of time trying to understand why it was hard for me to make friends, and why it was even harder to keep them. I finally understand. 

It’s not that I’m too shy, or too sad, or that I don’t like going to clubs. It’s not that I am fat or that I sweat a little too much in the summer. It’s not that I am french in an English speaking community. It’s not that I am smarter, or dumber. It’s not because I don’t remember movie names or actors’ faces. It’s not that I don’t really listen to music all the time. It’s not because I prefer documentaries and science stuff over reality tv. It’s not because I’m depressed and anxious. It’s not because I leave a little early some parties because I feel uncomfortable. It’s not because sometimes I don’t know what to say. It’s none of that. 

I didn’t realise before how my anger affected my relationships. I was in denial, I was my anger, I thought the reasons I acted why I acted were justified and that I was in my right mind to react angrily. 

How dare you disagree with me on the fact that the sky is pretty tonight ?? Well, let me tell you how that is not true. And why do you have to disagree anyway ? What is wrong with you ? Why is it that anything I say is not enough for you ? How come you don’t see that the sky is pretty ?? 

I thought my low self esteem or my feelings of not belongings could explain that I don’t keep friends. I thought since I’m sad and lonely, people can’t relate to me.

All this time I never saw that my anger to basically anything people would tell me could be the reason why I may be not super loved in this world.

I mean, it must be their fault, not mine right ?!

I would not be mean to everyone all the time. I would lie to them and pretend I’m fine and all is good, but the anger was there. Boiling inside of me. Waiting for our relationship to grow and become meaningful before it explodes and ruin it. 

A few days ago I lost one of the few friendship I managed to develop. We were close. I admired their (*I’d prefer to use gender neutral pronoun here) personality. Who they were. I thought they were interesting and I wanted to be there for them. I wasn’t too angry most of the time and I would be ok with how we would communicate. They were very open with me, as I was with them. We would share our sadness and joy. This was a real friendship to me. 

I am in a very low part of my life and I have a harder time controlling my anger, and I have a lower threshold for becoming angry too. So last week, they were the victim of my poor anger management. I insulted them out of the blue, for anger I felt towards another person. Their reply to me was shocking. They knew I was angry. They told me to manage it better. They told me they were scared for my other friends/family and that I was dangerous. 

You see, usually I would just get more angry. I would deny it. I would pretend they are in the wrong and I would convince myself of this. 

Not this time. This time I lost my only, and best, friend. And I gain consciousness of my issue. I visualised all my life as if I was moment from dying and it all clicked. All along, the reason why I struggle so much in life, all these fights, this hatred, this loneliness, these cries. 

I’m just angry and I can’t control it. 

But now I know, and I feel stronger and hopeful. This is what i have to work towards and this is what needs to change. Not my taste for movies or my fashion choices. My anger. 

Thank you if you have read all of that, I really wanted it out. Let’s connect if you feel or have felt the same and share tips to not hurts our friends.",1
"First time in this subreddit and today I’m just having a bad day.... my wife left me last month after 8 years of marriage and told me for the past few years she tried to see through my anger but it made her anxiety bad, she was stressed and had a hard time sleeping because of it. 

I come from an angry family. Both my parents did drugs so when the drugs ran out, they fought and fought and fought. Always yelling. Me and my siblings became angry people because of it. She knew of my childhood and my struggles. Once I got out of the military I became depressed and lonely.  I felt guilt every single day because of my temper... everyday I told myself not to get angry and everyday I got angry over something trivial. 

Now I’m alone. No friends. No wife. Stuck with my thoughts and feeling remorse everyday. I feel that I’m a good person with a kind heart... I don’t want to be angry anymore... since she’s left I’m too afraid to even get angry. Now when I’m stressed I get panic attacks which I never had before until now. 

I just wanted to share some feelings...I normally don’t dwell on my thoughts like this but today has just been hard. Now I’m back living with the family... I joined the military to escape this life and now I’m back in it. I took care of my soldiers and my wife but never myself and now it’s got me here. 

In hindsight, the military was a poor choice. All it did was make me more stressed and angry. When you’re in there is no more fight or flight. It’s just fight. Anger. Aggression.",1

"TW Violent thoughts.
Hi guys, first post here. Some background: I've been dealing with anger for a very long time without ever having sought help. Over the past few years, my outbursts have gotten more and more violent; it went from pillow hitting to wall punching to assault.

I live with my fiancée. She's the most wonderful woman in the world and I would do anything for her. She's very sweet, a bit frail, and absolutely terrified of me. I've punched walls and destroyed property (of my own) in front of her. I've never thrown anything at her, destroyed her things, or actually hit her (though an argument has escalated to me pushing her over once). 
I'm a lot larger than her and I could easily do a lot of damage. Hurting her is my worst nightmare, but I'm terrified of losing control. Sometimes I'll even envision myself choking her or hurting her when I'm pissed and it makes me feel better for a moment but then it makes me feel sick. I get so angry sometimes my vision goes red and white and adrenaline spikes through my body. Should I seek help before I accidentally hurt her? I don't want her to be afraid of me anymore and I hate imagining these awful things.

tl;dr I have violent tendencies and I'm afraid of hurting my fiancée. Is it time to see a professional? Have you guys experienced this?",1
"Hearing someone’s voice over the phone set me off today. I’m so fucking uncomfortable now and have been trying to scratch / bite off my skin because of it. This happens every single goddamn time someone is talking to me and I’m stuck taking the anger out on myself because I can’t get any fucking relief from anything else. I want to fucking skin myself alive, I fucking hate this. Why do I have to fucking talk to people? Can’t they get the hint that I want nothing to do with them? Same thing goes with being touched softly or people getting close to me. Just fucking punch me for Christ sake don’t fucking touch me like I’m some “delicate animal”. I’m going to end up scratching the skin off the area you touched anyway just fucking hit me don’t touch me like that.",1
"cw: sexual abuse

When someone is silent or withholding information, the uncertainty makes me panic and I become genuinely convinced that they are trying to hurt me. 

When I am in a good mental space, I am able to fight these thoughts. However, if someone becomes silent/withholds information repeatedly, I become angry as fuck. The anger comes from fear.

Right now, logically, I know there are a lot of understandable reasons why someone might become silent or withhold information. It’s human to do those things (I do them too!) and even if I hate it, it’s no excuse to take my anger out on them.

But when it happens, I am convinced that the person is trying to hurt me. It’s just the conclusion my brain comes to: if they cared about me then they would be honest with me and let me make my own decisions. When people are silent it feels like they are trying to control me and take my power away. 

I am 100% certain my reaction comes from childhood abuse. My sexual abuser was stoic and he would never warn me when he was going to do “it”, he would just take me out of bed any random night. It was impossible for me to know when it would happen.

In hindsight, I have tried to control this trigger by only getting close with people who communicate directly. However, this is not enough. Recently I cared about someone who is a passive communicator. Because of her own past, she shut down during conflict (she was scared). But that would set off my panic. I was able to handle this for a few months (I thought, maybe she needs time to open up, I’ll ask her about it later). But any time I asked, she would never elaborate. Eventually, she decided to outright lie instead. This sent me over the edge. I ended up accusing her of apologizing when she’s not actually sorry because she’s a liar (she’s really just scared, and doesn’t want people to hate her, and it’s unfair of me to assume the worst of her like that). All of the things I said just assumed the worst of her, as if she did the things she did to hurt me (and not because they’re coping mechanisms for her own fears). But at the time, I really *did* think she did this stuff to hurt me. In my mind, if someone doesn’t want to hurt me, then they will tell me their intentions. 

Because I didn’t know his intentions when I was abused :(

Now that I know this fear is linked to the past and not to anything happening in the present moment, I really hope I can manage this trigger. The problem is, this is only the 2nd time it’s happened (the first was 7 years ago). I avoid getting close to people, so I usually don’t care enough about someone to care if they are lying to me. So it’s actually not something I can practice on a regular basis (I am not regularly angry, only from this trigger).

What I *can* do, though, is work on not simplifying others/reaching conclusions about them in my mind. I can remind myself that human complexity is more varied than my puny perspective allows. I can counter judgments/criticisms I have of others with alternative points of view. And most importantly: I really really really want to assume people are doing their best, instead of how I currently feel, which is that people are trying to hurt me.

"i just cracked my computer screen with my mouse and i just had the biggest mix of emotions. mostly anger. i was so angry at myself and my moronic tendency to get angry easily that i just started to hit my self, and slap, and whip myself with a belt. after that it is just self hatred and questions like ""am i a good person?""

heres the part that worries me though. breaking my phone... it feels good almost, like euphoric. obviously now im super bummed i broke my phone but at the time it was like winning 50 bucks on a scratch off. strange. its almost like i bottle it all in and when the chance comes my anger comes out like crazy, and i fucking hate it.",1

"Like the title says, I've always had anger problems. I'm a woman, 26, and I'm almost always angry. What sets me off the most is when people correct me. I get blindly rageful. Not just once in awhile, but almost every single time I speak. It makes me feel like I'm an idiot who doesn't know anything. It makes me feel extremely degraded and stepped on. Literally everyone does it to me. I feel like there's a target on my back.

I feel a genuine hate for people and I'm only happy when I'm alone. I get angry on the bus commute to work if someone sits next to me. I get angry at the store when someone cuts in front of me to get something instead of just waiting. I get angry on the road when people do illegal things and cut me off. I never retaliate for any of these things except when my anger bottles up for too long and I have a complete rageful outburst, so bad that I should be subdued with medication.

I feel like I probably have depression. I don't want to live. I'm sick of the anger. I'm sick of the sadness. I'm sick of feeling like everyone is against me. How can I ever meet anyone when literally EVERYONE corrects me? I could talk to a random person and say ""Wow, the sky is so blue today"" and 99% of the time they will reply ""Not really.

I would like to share with you helpful advice given to me about guidance towards internal reflection.

The wisest of my therapists, counselors, mediators, gurus, parents, and teachers have given me similar advice over time.

My anger is not CAUSED by anyone or ANYTHING else.

My anger is mine, and mine alone. It is my reaction to the situation which I perceive as anger. Nobody made me feel this way. These feelings are caused by thoughts and those thoughts originated from within my mind.

By blaming others I lose my ability to take responsibility for the situation. If I'm not responsible then I have no will to correct something.

"Tl;dr at bottom

So over the past few months, my life has turned around to become substantially better than it was previously. I went from a single, unemployed, depressed hermit to dating a great girl, getting friends, finding an awesome job, and being all around happier person. 

In the bad times, as I call them, my negative emotions mostly surfaced as anger, usually toward myself or my ex or some old friends. Now I’m really not getting angry at things. Minor inconveniences don’t send me into a fit, and even major ones annoy me more than make me rage.

However, I’m also realizing that I am getting angry in one place; behind the wheel. I’ve been getting angry on the road for a while now. I tend to go 10 mph above the speed limit on normal roads and 15-20 mph above the limit on the highway. I swerve between lanes to pass people and flip off really slow drivers. I was practically clenching the wheel after rush hour today. 

But five minutes after I step out of the car, I’m back to normal. Calm, in control, cool. Does anyone else find themselves raging only in specific situations?

"My fiancé grew up with an explosive mother and I think it rubbed off on him, he is not a bad person and I do not want this post to seem like I’m trying to make him out to be at all. The situation here is that he is very defensive at all times most likely from her attacking him verbally all his life and takes almost all conversation as an insult and immediately freaks out or if I ask him to take out the trash or something he will respond angrily about it. We just had a child together and i know he’s under a lot of pressure but i can’t take walking around on eggshells with his constant attitude, I think it’s been worse since he’s sleep deprived a bit.  He’s very unhappy and minor inconveniences stress him out much more than the average person (I don’t know how else to put Thisbe ), to him a diaper change turns into an end of the world scenario causing him great distress and he will start yelling and cursing and it puts me into a panic attack hearing him get like that. he’s changed a lot over the years overcoming a lot of negative behaviors he had from living with his family like road rage etc but this attitude and anger has become a constant thing in his daily life and it’s making our relationship suffer, I can barely talk to him or ask him to do a small task without wishing I wouldn’t have to avoid him getting frustrated and worked up. I only get so many hours with him a day after work and he’s just so angry and frustrated the entire time he’s home if anything goes slightly wrong and it just puts me on edge, I just want him to live a happy life and not get so discouraged at every little thing.",1

I would be all cheerful and dancing and joking with my husband. Then all of a sudden for something really small I lose my shit. I start yelling at him. I feel ready to burst. I cry I shout I throw things sometimes. And I can't stop being angry.
In the past I've tried hurting myself and it helps a little bit. But I promised my husband I wont do that anymore.
So now I try petting my cat. I try reading posts on reddit. I tried going through French lessons on duolingo. Nothing helps. It's like there's this ball of rage that formed inside me all of a sudden and it wont go away. It hurts my head. It hurts my chest. It physically hurts and mentally drains me.
Is this what people with anger normally go through?
I'm not even angry all the time. Once every few days. But when it comes it's like a dam broke and now there's no way to stop it.
Does anyone have any suggestions on how they cope with this?",1
"First of all sorry for my bad english

i rage alot. idk why some things triggers me and i get angry. i hurt alot peoples and i feel shit for it. i came here to seek help. is there something i can do to controle my anger? help appreciated.",1
"So, I never used to feel anger. All I felt was despair, self-pity, and self-loathing, and whatever bad happened I always attributed it to myself not deserving any better. Later in life I was diagnosed with chronic depression, and now in a few years of treatment it's finally gone. I have appetite again, but most importantly, I finally can get angry.

And it's like something uncontrollable and unstoppable got unleashed. Now in the same situations when I used to loathe myself, I start getting angry. Not at myself, mind you, the direction of my feelings has changed. It's anger at the world, at life, and just generally at everything that hurts me or fails or doesn't go my way, and it flares up at any minor opportunity! Even when it's completely stupid to get angry. Like, I keep failing a test and I become so worked up about it that I lose an ability to do anything, let alone proceed with the test. Anger is all-consuming, it's eating me alive. I even hurt myself and make myself bleed trying to work it out by hitting the table as hard as possible with the back of my hand, but it never really helps.

That's the problem with anger: it just won't stop, it can never be satisfied, and I know of no way to work it out! No matter what I do, like hit things or cuss, anger won't stop. It's so excruciating, it's a horrible feeling: you NEED to work it out somehow, yet you CAN'T!! The only way to deal with it I've found is to get distracted, but once I'm back in the same situation it started in, or just merely get reminded of it, it's back full-force. So that ultimately isn't helpful AT ALL in most cases, because if I got angry while, say, doing a test, then even if I've calmed down, going back to the test immediately makes me feel angry again. It's like the initial anger issue was not resolved, so it's back with no changes. It hampers my productivity because I just can't go back to the test in this example.

P.S At this point I start to believe that depression was better. I still have semi-depressive thoughts and think of myself as a piece of shit, but now in addition to that I have anger feelings which make me unable to focus on stuff until I manage to distract myself (which takes a very long time, sometimes hours), and sometimes even that won't ultimately help. What a great result of a few years of therapy and meds...",1

I mentally cannot look at the stupid FIG drawings they provide and translate it to actually performing the actions. I get insanely angry. 

I just got so mad that I went outside to have a cigarette and after lighting up I threw my lighter as hard as I could at the floor of my porch. I let go too early, so it didn’t hit that hard. I was so mad that I had to pick the lighter back up to throw it again, properly hard this time.

"I swear if I don't way to find a way to handle this crap I'll lose it.

I'm a supervisor at my job, been so for over a decade, on the job two. Unfortunately, between the union representing my subordinates and the managers above me, many decisions I (and my fellow supervisors) make regarding discipline get overturned, because well, only they know their goal behind it. It has given the subordinates the attitude they run the place, and many of my fellow supervisors just gave up and allow it to continue. Today was one of those days I had to really hold back.

Guy comes to me. Apparently, yesterday, a supervisor gave him a work assignment that was cancelled after he reported to his work site. So today, the guy comes in, and tells me how ""this isn't going to happen again,"" ""I have fifteen years on the job, I'm going to work when I say I want to,"" ""You supervisors are idiots no one knows how to do their job, I could do it eyes closed,"" and so on. I give him a work assignment, and he tells me ""I better not get cancelled."" Even uttered some homophobic slurs.

Wouldn't you know I get the call this work is cancelled, the guy is pleased, and proceeds to sit across the room for me, and smiling at me, gloating. My blood is boiling.

I get a call for a new work assignment, and I give it to him. Now he continues to sit, delaying, and continuing to smile at me defiantly. It came time I was relieved by another supervisor, and when I left, a half hour later, the guy had still not left for his assignment. I was tempted to stay a few minutes, missing my bus home, just to nail to guy. I ultimately decided not to do it, and go home. Wouldn't you know my fucking bus was cancelled, and I could have stayed and see if this guy left, or if he was going to defy me and not leave for his assignment. I was fuming, and began plotting how I can get this guy next time.

Problem is, 1) all this plotting is going to do is upset me and make me burn more, because as the past shows management is just going to overturn my disciplinary suggestion if I caught him at something even with a solid case and 2) I have many more like him. I supervise/assign around fifty to sixty employees on any given day. They're not all as bad as he is, but more than I'd care to deal with.

Anyone have any suggestions on how they would curb the anger, handling this, before I end up doing something stupid? The more I saw him sitting there, smiling, I got madder, and madder and tempted to say something stupid. Obviously I'm still fuming if I'm writing this, and I have been home three hours.

The keyboard is expensive but, I am a hot headed prick with little worth. so I started biting my arm in frustration, but only to leave a mark and not bleed.

"(Useless info, I’m 16f)
Rant, so this might get confusing as I don’t go over these and make sure they’re grammatically correct.
Okay so, I know that violence is a very horrible thing and I will never act on violence in any way. But when I’m in an anger episode or if someone pisses me off in the slightest way, I always think about myself..like hurting them. The bad people who hurt me. It gets to the point where I casually think about it. I do suffer from C-PTSD so like lots of s*xual trauma and just trauma in general from multiple people, and that’s part of the reason why I think like this, but a lot of others that go through even worse trauma than I have been through don’t think like this, at least that I know of. It’s really hard for me to share this cause I have that big thought in my head saying “someone is going to show this to a police officer and they’re going to take me to jail or a mental hospital. (I honestly wouldn’t mind going to a mental hospital at this point). I am going to receive trauma therapy more in September so I can talk to a new therapist about it. But I just want to know if anyone else is like that or if I really am “psycho”.",1
"Does anyone else wish that sometimes people would be dicks whenever you get angry?? I hate when I am angry and the person it’s usually directed at tries to guilt trip or acts upset/sad, I would rather someone just shout back so I don’t feel so bad after the whole “haze” has worn off",1

I’m on day two of not smoking and I was highly stressed as it is, along with other issues in life. I just could not handle him not listening to me and she heard my yelling and so my anger. She’s never going to see me the same way again. I’m embarrassed and angry at myself. I ended up relapsing back into smoking because of this.",1

"I couldn't recall a time I've felt anger, doubt I ever have; a psychiatrist I saw for ADHD mentioned it was weird but we didn't explore it.

Or does it just sorta flow out of you, for lack of much better words. Thanks.",1
"Does anyone else suffer anger attacks? 

Where you get so angry and frustrated, your heart starts beating faster and your breathing increases? You desperately want to lash out but don't so it turns to angry tears? Then get so wound up at yourself you can't think straight?

"You can't control your aura. There is, explicitly, no way to fake it or cloak it. Everyone is forced to be honest about their emotions at all times, and it's literally impossible to force someone to ""suck it up"" because everyone can see the buried feelings, right there. When someone talks to me like they just expect me to go along with everything they say they have to cover their eyes from the energy spikes I'm too cowardly to voice. Social anxiety doesn't exist because you're unable to hide or suppress a thing about yourself. If something makes you happy or sad or joyfully or uncomfortable, everyone immediately sees it and has to accept it, because their own auras are just as flawed and spiky, albeit over different issues. When I'm royally pissed off, everyone can clearly see why, and I feel no pressure to conceal it because how could I?

I hate this world of happy masks and smiling paintings. I want to have the backbone to tell someone exactly why what they're doing is a stone in my fucking shoe without instinctively watering it down, filing away the teeth, and ultimately deciding the stone isn't so bad, not worth bothering someone over as it eats away at my soul. It's my problem really, I shouldn't expect others to cater to my personality right?",1
"I don't know why this happens but, whenever someone really ticks me off I feel some sort of pressure build up in my head and I get a strong impulse and can't control my actions on what happens next, I sometimes curse out someone or actually get physical. I immediately, right after my impulse, regret what I had done. I really need some help with this kind of issue. My friends have put up with me all this time and I don't want to lose them over my anger.

This same thing happens to me when I'm playing competitive video games. I just get a huge impulse to slam my desk, keyboard, or throw my mouse ""to get the anger out"".

"I hate calling myself a victim, but I realize I act like it because I use my past as a crutch. I have been sexually abused by multiple people, and I’ve been angry with myself for a long time for allowing them to do those things to me. In a lot of cases, I went back to the person because I hated the thought of being alone. I would download and delete Tinder only to have terrible experiences time and time again. One particular incident has angered me for three years now. I was sexually assaulted by a member of my church, and I initially kept it to myself. I finally opened up to my parents about it, and they told the pastor of the church, but I STILL see him every Sunday. And another worse incident is that I was raped by a coworker who also attended school with me, and he got to keep his job. After a 10 month trial, my university didn’t find him guilty. In addition to being depressed, suicidal and anxious, it makes me ashamed to have gone through all of this trauma at 21, and I pray my daughter never has to deal with this. I hate that I feel this way because it’s hard to talk about it, especially when I don’t have a good enough support system. I am angry with myself for not standing up, and even angrier at the world and my offenders for getting away with these acts. I’m just trying to turn my life around so I can stop blaming others and myself..",1

I would/still get angry at certain stupid things. Video games is the worst offender for me and I was getting a lot better up until recently. I would break things, punch walls, shout etc. Then I would get angry with myself for acting like an idiot and the cycle would continue.

My problem now is that I have returned to it and I don't know why. I thought it was because I was a teenager then (19 now) and it was just hormones. I have really no reason to be angry anymore. I have a new job that I like, a loving family, good friends and such. I just don't understand.

Also, I have been able to understand a lot about people who repeatedly make me angry from listing their lack of skills.  For instance, my boyfriend has a habit of verbalizing critiques.  It's amazing how many things that make me angry are repeating episodes.  It felt like there were 1000 things that made me angry, but when I broke things down, its basically the same few scenarios over and over again.

"This morning at 4 I posted a text explaining my anger issues regarding videos games :
https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/c1kucd/anger_issues_while_playing_video_games/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share. 
I got some advices . One was that I had to try to fight my problems by playing a competitive game and give myself the challenge of staying as calm as possible and stop whenever I feel the anger comming in . That's what I did . I think it was a very great advice and I still think it is but ... After only one 5 minutes match , I rage quited , threw my GameCube controller , ended up destroying a whole mirror by punching it . My mom isn't even here to help me , she's fucking selfish . 
For more details I was playing smash ultimate , during the whole match I felt stuck against the ennemy character . I raged everytime I'd get hit and explode everytime somehow my character didn't punch her despite all my efforts . So I basically can't even play one match without getting frustrated . I'm against the wall ... 
It's gonna be hard to resign myself but I think I will have to stop . I can't take it anymore , I don't understand why my brain can't just enjoy playing the game anymore ... My emotions go up and down same as for my motivation.  I can't take these roller coasters anymore . That's it , I'll ppbly lay in my bed for the rest of my life ...",1

I am basically the typical ""loser"" you'll meet. I live with my parents still.I never wanted this for myself and I wanted to do better, but to no avail. I used to get angry about my current situation and break stuff and punch walls etc. One day recently I was getting really angry about something,I shake violently when I get angry and I feel that I was about to pass put because of the fast blood flow etc. I took a deep breath and told myself this ""It dosen't matter"". This changed me, now when I am close to getting angry because thinking about my dark future I just say this and accepted that there is nothing I can do about it.

I am not happy but not angry too, which is much better because I thought my heart was going to explode because of the stress. I found a way to get rid of my anger and I am kinda proud of it!",1
"I am in depression and currently fucking sad and angry . I even posted on the depression subreddit to have help because I can't cry . I don't have anger issues only when playing video games , it happens pretty much all the times when something doesn't happen as I wish . But it's when I play video games that the rage really comes into play , especially competitive games where there is a clear winner and loser . While playing solo games like Zelda Breath of the wild , I almost never get angry . Only one time against a boss that I was struggling against . But when I play a competitive game like League of Legends or smash bros ultimate ( yes there is a way of playing it competitively , it's not just playing with 3 of your friends for a whole night , since I have no friends ) I get angry very easily at the smallest of the details . For example in smash I pretty much get a pulse of anger everytime I get hit . For those who don't know , it is almost impossible to not get it throughout a match . You pretty much have to be a god to be able to perfect someone . I feel stuck and I always blame my loss on other factors even though it's not true . I only see the negative aspects and I don't even enjoy playing . I just want to cry but I can't . I don't know how to expel my frustration . I've tried everything from taking a bath , taking a walk or running ... None of this worked . The only thing that kinda works is physical destruction of objects . The problem is that on the moment I feel great but afterwards I feel uncomfortable and even angryer especially if I destroyed important items to me . Plus on the moment it irritates my family . 
After what I've said some people may tell me to stop playing competitive video games . But I just want to make sure everyone understands this . If this is the respond that you are gonna give me , just don't write to me at all . I prefer it that way . 

Video games are the only thing that make me happy in life . Well... It currently makes me angry . But I love the competitive games as,compared to the solo games, you can share it with other people and have good memories , from going to a tournament at a friend's house(Ok I know I said I had no friends but like ,right now I don't.They're all studying for their exams) or this one time the underdog ( the one that is the less likely to win ) actually pulls something off and wins . I tried meditation , maybe I didn't give it enough time but I don't think It will magically make me calm while playing video games . It's been a lot of years since I don't enjoy playing competitive games anymore . I've tried stopping them and doing other things like just chilling or play more calm games . But then I was really bored and instead of being super angry , I felt depressed and empty like something was missing in my life . By reading this you could say I'm a competitive person, but not really . Sure if I win I'm happy but I don't seek desperate wins just to brag about it . My mindset is that you play a game for fun . While it might look contrary to what I've said earlier on how I love to COMPETE . But see , tryharding a video game is my way of having fun . And maybe playing something like Mario party is fun I only enjoy it on short periods . When I play a game I want to have one that's possibly infinite and play it for several years . Like I did with League of Legends , it's been 2 and half years since I started and me and my friends are still playing it . 

So here is the important question : 
Should I completely stop competitive games for a few mouths to concentrate on just being happy again.Take the time to clear my mind and finding ways to stop my anger issues ? And more importantly , will having a way happier life make me enjoy games again , and make me excited/determined like I used to be ?
Currently after a big loss streak I feel super angry, then sad . I tell myself , ""that's it,my life is done , I'll lay in my bed for the rest of my days"" , and I feel like giving up on all my dreams . That's how hard it is.  I feel like I forgot to mention a lot of things, but for now I'd say it's enough and I think people are gonna be able to help me with just that information.  Thanks in advance .",1
"I get angry over tiny things that shouldn't really get to me, and it makes me rage out and hit myself. I haven't done any lasting damage, but I mostly end up slapping myself repeatedly in the face or punching myself in the leg. If I'm in my car, I may actually start screaming, because it's the only place I can scream very loudly without getting unwanted attention. It's a very primal, fucked up feeling. 

I haven't admitted any of this to anyone until now, because it's weird and I'm embarrassed. It doesn't happen often, but when it does it's just like...I want to cause physical pain, even if it's to myself. I haven't seen a therapist about it, because I can't bring myself to admit that I actually fucking do this stupid shit to someone in person.

I need help managing my anger. That count to ten and take deep breaths shit isn't enough. I just feel intense hatred and loathing toward certain people and even myself sometimes, and I don't cope well.

Does anyone else struggle with this?",1
"When I was younger, I had a horrible temper.  While I was younger than 8 or so I would throw huge temper tantrums. Screaming, crying, flailing around on the ground, and throwing things. But, people don’t put up with that for very long and little kids should learn how to handle their temper in a different way by the time they’re 8 or 10 so I got in trouble for tantrums and I’d just hold it in and cry sometimes.

When I hit puberty, things hit the fan. One day my older sister, who can be emotionally abusive/manipulative at times, was making me angry while I was putting dishes away and I just lost it. I know that I wanted to make her shut up, but I didn’t know what I was doing. It’s like I closed my eyes for a second and then opened them to see my mom shoving me away from my sister and both of them yelling at me. They thought I was gonna kill her because I was holding a knife that I had been putting away. I didn’t want to hurt her. 
Around a year ago I was alone with my sister and she made me feel so angry I blacked out again and when I came back, she and I were hitting each other and she ended hitting me to the ground. I don’t know what actually happened, she’s been known to exaggerate, but she said that I was trying to strangle her and she had fought me off. 

Why am I blacking out? How can I stop it? I’m going to go on testosterone soonish, and I wanna know why this happened so that I can learn to control myself before I get a temper boost from the testosterone. I don’t want to lose myself and actually hurt my sister or anyone else.",1
"I get uncontrollably raged over little things and the rage turns me into a completely different person who is not going to think twice before hurting someone or himself... I'm just 16 and I really want to get rid of this rage... 

I THINK IT ALL BEGAN LIKE THIS :-

It all began with domestic abuse 2 years ago.. 
My family members had a fight that I witnessed and it changed me a lot. 
My father was accused and mother were accused by my maternal grand father and maternal uncle of doing something which they didn't do for sure... 
Me and my parents lived together with them since last 17 years.. (Before I was born) and now we parted with them because they did some seriously wrong accusing on my parents.. 
After this incident I had breakup with my gf (we were together since last 2 years) 
And after all this my grandpa got paralyzed and after 8 months he passed away... (I saw him dying right in front of my eyes) 
Grandpa's demise broke my family very much... 
And I took all the pain inside me and never expressed to anyone.... 

I still sometimes cry at night for the things happened and what they made me... 

I'm currently struggling to quit porn... 



Please help me out with the rage... 🙏 🙏",1
"Someone at my school keeps cutting their fingernails with scissors and throws it at my face, it’s gross. How do I stop this and solve this?",1
"I've been home for 1 week and I just realised that I get way over emotional towards my grandma. I hate that feeling and I want to change it but it only resulted in me doesn't talk to her since if I talk, I can't control what I said. 

My spike of anger usually came after I heard she mumbling. My grandma hardly ever stops talking, either giving me orders to clean the house or mumbling about how everything isn't tidy and line up perfectly. When you meet her, she always has something to say and she never changes for over 20+ years that I live with her. 

I thought moving out will help me gain something but it doesn't change whenever I came home, I keep being frustrated about my ability to keep listening to her and took it negatively. I can hear her mumble ranting louder in my brain every time I catch it and that makes me go wild, there is this certain amount of ""enough"" in my chest and I just want her to shut up, talk when necessary and just stop. 

I've expressed that thought enough in the past but she took it as ""I am just an angry child"" and I was always wrong and not live up to her expectation, it was always my fault and she is our grandma. She does unnecessary things like change the order of things that already line up, cleaning over stuff that just been cleaned, wash everything again because what I did apparently isn't clean enough, folding the clothes that I put up for hanging, wash any clothes that is left on the hanger even if it's brand new and always make your bed again after you make your bed. 

I agree I am not as meticulous in cleaning as she is but I am not messy at all, I don't want to spend more hours to clean something that already good. 

Now, anything that she said makes me angry. I don't like she is talking to me and I don't do whatever she asked because I don't like it. I guess several people in the house had picked up my behaviour. 

Is there a way to calm me? 

I guess I should stop taking what she said seriously but I just can't, I hate it, it reminds me of all the anger and things I hated in the past, it makes me want to yell ""shut up!!!, just stop doing anything"" but I can't yell either or everyone will get angry at me.",1
"I came here to finally put down on paper how I feel. I don't have the explosive outbursts that some have on here, but instead I have like a.. Seething anger that seems to bubble when I get anxious or when I cannot control a situation.


I have three small children and I am mainly reaching out because I think I am starting to affect them negatively. They are 4, 2, and 8 months. I am not really a yeller, but I tend to use my hands to manage situations that need words. I didn't know how else to say that, but I do NOT mean I hit my children, I mean like I will pick my 2yo up and just move him where he needs to go instead of talking to him. That's an example but it happens a lot and it nearly always makes them upset.


My 4 year old is picking up habits like when I will take an object out of his or his brothers hand if they shouldn't have it. I see this and am working on using my words, just as I am trying to teach him.


My 2 year old. He just gets so angry sometimes. I'm sure it's terrible twos, but I feel like I am role modeling anger instead of patience.


My 8 month old. She is so tiny and delicate but she never sleeps well; I go to bed late and wake up early anyway (would love to consider getting more sleep as an option but I don't think that's feasible) and when she doesn't sleep and is just wailing I have just wanted so badly to shake her that I just give her to my wife instead. I don't know why because I love her so much but I still have that feeling.


I will often self harm to try and diminish my anger. I punch myself in the head until I feel dizzy and that usually works. It's unhealthy and so I try to use other methods but tbh I think about it a lot, just pounding my head against something until it's a bloody pulp. Once I bashed my head into the corner of a wall and left a pretty solid scar. 


As far as reaching out for professional help, I don't feel like I can. I feel that my wife would not understand that I love them so much but I still feel angry, and I am absolutely terrified of losing my children. 


So... Here I am. Asking for advice. I don't want to live like this anymore.",1
"Whenever I start feeling angry because of something, I try to supress my emotion. If Im alone, I insult myself(but not really with faul language) and eventually hit myself. I hit myself with power supply plug so I doesnt make that much noise compared to when you hit with your fist. I have intrusive thoughts and they cause endless suffer. They are almost about everything and when bad ones happen, then I start punishing myself for that. Other people are not guilty of my state, but only me. Even when I get little disappointed because for example someone breaks the driving rules and I start saying that this shouldnt be done, I immediately start punishing myself. Its like: ""why did you even say anything""
There are times that everything is ok but then self hitting appears.",1

Greetings,

This is my first time posting here, on the way to work today swarmed with negative emotions that I’m just tired of, I thought there’s got to be a place to go on Reddit for some wisdom.  Here is where  I ended up!

&amp;#x200B;

I’ll cut to the chase. I have trouble dealing with major negative life changing events. An example of this would be my ex-wife cheated on me with my best friend and ran off together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course this would piss anyone off. However it takes me way too long to let go of the anger. Each and every individual day I thought about that, how angry it made me feel and how I longed for some sort of Justice. Sometimes I’d stew over a majority of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, that doesn’t sound unreasonable given the circumstances. But what if I told you that I felt like and thought about that every single day for ten years? 

&amp;#x200B;

Ten years! For the last two years, it finally doesn’t matter to me anymore. No longer invokes any kind of emotion. It was so wonderful to be free from that prison of hate and anger.  I thought moving forward I was done. 

&amp;#x200B;

However something far worse occurred last year to me. I could go in to length but I really don’t want to get fired up and ruin my weekend.  It’s a pretty long story of pain, violation and misery. 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew after everything blew over on this that I was in real trouble. Knowing my history and this being a far worse experience that I’d be seeing red for at least a decade, constantly, every day.  That’s no way to live. 

&amp;#x200B;

I planned for it. I keep myself busy as much as possible, I can’t allow any time to think. On the way to work every day, that thirty five minutes is filled with rage. I think about how rewarding it would be to beat the shit of them, then make them suffer as I did or as a bonus worse than I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

I call my father on the way home to talk and normally fills that gap. But if it’s quite at work like today, I focus my time here, either making a dad joke or just trying to help. Anything to keep me mind busy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tell myself every day that “You know you could stop this at any time. After all, you are the one in control. All you have to do is stop”. I’ve told myself that and many other words of wisdom I’ve read or was told, yet nothing seems to allow me to get it under control.

&amp;#x200B;

I was angry for 10 years, had a one year break. Now i'm going on my second year over this new thing. The only different is the intensity is much stronger. Perhaps because it’s far worse, or because it still feels recent, or a little a both. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I do know is, I’m tired of it and I can do better. While a majority of things happen to us are bad, it’s just a part of life, get over it. But I can’t figure out how to do that last one. I give myself all these pep talks all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

It would be comforting to know if others experienced anger for as long as I have. Also any words of wisdom I can integrate in to my arsenal of keeping it under control.  I just want to live free of this emotion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!",1
"Hello, 

I want to start getting a handle on this problem. 99% of my waking time, I’m a happy and calm person. But I often get into 10-20 second rage fits. I would say about once or twice a day. These fits happen during a variety of activities. 

Video games. this is usually when I mess up. I’m just mad at myself usually.

When my new puppies push me over the edge. I can tolerate a good bit, but I usually get triggered when they start running from me or won’t acknowledge me when I call their name after a few times.

Driving. I would say this is the worst of them. I get mad so easily when driving.

When these fits happen, I just snap. I feel like a lose my mind for a few seconds. My chest feels like it’s boiling on the inside and my stomach feels like it’s imploding in on itself. I get really loud and NEED to hit something. Let me be clear, I have never hit a living thing and I don’t believe I ever will; That’s not why I’m here. Usually I’ll hit my leg, the counter, a pillow or any nearby soft surface. When i say hit, I don’t mean punch with knuckles full force. I mean hammer fist style with the pad of my hand. They don’t even have to be particularly hard to do the trick, but can be if it won’t hurt too bad. A simple bang on the counter can do the trick. 

If there is nothing around for me to hit or I’m trying to resist, I will usually squeeze my fists as hard as I can, grit my teeth and scream. And then it’s over. I can be right back to how I was. I just snap for a few seconds, need to get it out, then I’m good again. I hate it. My wife hates it. I don’t want to do it anymore. I’ve been trying to actively think about it and stop, but I could be thinking about getting mad seconds before it happens and something inside of me just takes over and I snap. 

This morning I got angry at my dog for peeing on the bed after they had just been outside. I didn’t hit anything this time but I got really loud as I often do. Then on my way to work I got mad multiple times at traffic (people going slow). This was probably facilitated by the fact that I was running late because of the dog peeing on the bed. Nevertheless, it happened. 

I starting thinking about how someday I’m going to have kids. The will undoubtedly do shit that makes me mad. They will be in the car with me when people do dumb things in traffic. I don’t want to be that person. I don’t want to be that dad. I don’t want my kids to be scared of me. I don’t want to snap on my kids. I need to get a handle on this NOW. We plan to have kids no sooner than 4 years so I have some time but I want to start now. 

Ps. I am like 10 times more likely to hit things when no one is around. If my wife is around I will usually get moderately loud and that’s it. When I’m home alone and something happens I’m almost guaranteed to hit something hard. 

If anyone has any suggestions on where to start, I would be very grateful. Thank you.",1
"Welp, the Yankees are about to lose to the White Sox.  THE FUCKING WHITE SOX!  A TEAM IN THE AL CENTRAL THAT'S NOT THE TWINS!  I get so angry when the Yankees lose to teams that they really should be beating, and my parents can't take my constant anger!  The pressure is on for the Yankees to make the playoffs in 2019, as the Giants, the Knicks, and the Rangers all missed the playoffs this year.  So far in my life (I was born in 1994), there hasn't been a single year where none of my favorite teams made the postseason.  Every time the Yankees lose, I feel like torturing myself by blaring songs associated with the Red Sox, namely Sweet Caroline, Dirty Water, and Tessie, even going as far as shouting ""Yankees suck!""  I should really stop doing this.  I have been seeing a therapist and his advice has helped a little, but not completely.  I'm sorry this post is very long, but I need as much help as I can get.",1
"Constantly, i’m usually a very peaceful funny and caring person, but whenever I open myself up to someone, that person usually begins to see darker sides of myself, and it can turn incredibly dark which makes people fear for their life, I know this isn’t good. I fucking hate myself for it and want to kill myself thinking of all the regret I have over dumb shit, because it feels like I can’t be close to anyone because I just freak out on them, its not as if im possessive, an example would be my family, or a so, with my family ive always felt unheard and mistreated and left out, and a lot of the times the arguments just immediately escalate and get physical, and with an so i’d make them want to feel how i feel in terms of hurt, which i want to be redirected at my family, or turn this anger into protection for those who love and care for me, my phones at 1% so i gotta post this",1
"I’ve been getting angry and jealous a lot lately. I like to start fights on the internet and in real life. I got into an argument with my uncle and he’s going to throw me out. I threatened to kill myself and that it was all his fault that I was going to do it. It all started when I started bitching about this random girl on the internet who was living her dream of being a voice actor while I have nothing and never will have anything because life hates me for some reason. I’ll never have another job, I’ll never be successful in life. I want to kill myself, I’m so angry at my life. I just want to start fights all the time.",1
"Every night when I go to bed I lay there for a few hours thinking of violent things and shaking with rage. I fantasize about having any excuse to snap. Not homicidal specifically, just violent. I know this isn't healthy but I can't get help without being hospitalized or having certain people be warned, as far as I know. 

I have no intention of ever doing these things but I can't guarantee that I would never lash out at someone at all. I have less and less control over my anger every day. I find myself snapping around my mom more often, which is something I'd *never* do before because I never show her my emotions at all. I literally feel possessed, because I have no choice but to yell and swear. One may argue that it's a choice, but these outbursts come out of absolutely nowhere and I don't feel like I'm myself at all when it happens. It's like I'm being controlled.",1
 I have a strong burst of anger and urge to just pump my fist into the stupid keyboard. Why the hell I can't get good at anything no matter how much time I put into it? Why does my anger and issues have to come out even during peaceful activity like playing a piano?,1

"Do I have an anger management problem or is it just normal anger to normal events? I don’t know. I do know that when I lose my temper I yell.... I lose my temper when I am stressed or frustrated....when I do t know what people want from me. 

Sometimes the people I lash out at will say that they feel abused when I yell at them. It was said today, and it makes me concerned. I don’t want to abuse people. I don’t want to lose my temper. It just happens... quick like a flash. 

They are saying I have a problem so I must have a problem. That said. I need help. Where do I start? I see a therapist for the anxiety and the depression. Should I see her about the anger? How do I recognize when I am getting angry when it happens so quickly. Saying sorry afterwards means nothing when I say sorry all the time for so many other things. A push in the right direction would be appreciated. Thank you for you help.",1
"The same thing happened to my old laptop. I don’t know how to stop myself, please help me.",1
"I just got so angry that I almost could not physically stop myself from brutally beating somebody. I popped a few capillaries in my eyeballs and almost passed out afterwards, now I feel spent and tired. I was wobbling and unsteady on my feet as my entire neck and face turned brick red and veins popped out of my neck. That's happened before, but never for that bad or for that long of a time period (I did this for around 30-60 seconds straight). I'm currently taking Zoloft for severe anxiety/depression/suicidal ideation and urges, and I'm prescribed low doses of Adderall for ADD. Both help me tremendously and I feel like a new and improved person most of the time. Today, I just lost my shit. Completely.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I barely had control, and could have just as easily done something very regrettable and irrevocable. That was a scary experience.",1
"Hi,

I'm new to this sub and I'm just looking for some support. I've always had anger issues, to the point where I need to lash out and yell, and feel the need to verbally abuse someone. Over the last decade and a bit, I've been able to manage it really well with only a few setbacks here and there. However, I can confidently say that over the last 6 years, I haven't had an outbursts until today. Today I just snapped. So this is what happened:

My mum found a bottle of milk in the fridge, there was only a bit left, and she wasn't sure who brought this milk in. She asked me, my siblings and my gran and we all said we didn't buy it or bring it over from my aunt's (mum's sister) house. Keep in mind, my mum has something against her own sister, she's always just mean to her for no reason. So I told my mum that she probably bought it and forgot about it. She denied it, and I thought that would be the end of it and we would move on because it's only milk. But no. My mum decided to harass me while I was doing my assignment, telling me over and over to tell the truth and just admit that I was the one that brought it over from our aunt's house. It was so constant that I just snapped. I angrily slammed my laptop and whacked the charger against my bunk bed ladder because I needed a release (both are okay thank goodness). Then I started yelling at her and calling her an accuser and that's all she's good at. Then I went to the kitchen where I continued to yell at her for never believing me, etc. I was just so fed up that I pushed the ironing board because I was just about shaking. The ironing board didn't hit anyone, it just moved forward by a few inches. So in my anger, I decided that I wanted to combine the milk with the new bottle. They're both the same brand of milk and same expiry, just different sizes. She yanked it out of my hand, causing my hand to spill the open bottle of milk. She continued yelling at me, I obviously yelled back at her accusations. She then grabbed the empty bottle of milk and threw it at me, so I threw it back at her. She wanted me to clean up and I said no out of anger, and that I was done putting up with her bullshit. She then decided to leave, but before she did, she decided to hit me with her bag several times. Even in my anger I never hit back, NEVER. So I restrained her arms instead so she can stop hitting me. By then I calmed down, but she wouldn't stop screaming. It was so high-pitched. And she kept lashing out, trying to escape my grip but I just didn't want her to keep hitting me. My gran told me to let her go so I did, and she cooled off and I cooled off. Then my gran told her off for starting drama over milk, but I didn't hear most of it since I was shakily cleaning up the kitchen floor and the walls from all the splash back. 

Now that I am calm again, I just wanted to know how everyone else deals with something like that. I realised I get triggered when I'm called a liar over and over and over. Does anyone have any life tips as to how I can push through and try and ignore it without letting my inner demon run loose. I'm normally a bubbly person, but I know that when I'm angry, I'm vicious in every possible way. The worst part is that I actually love that feeling of hitting an object and I think that spurs my anger on. I just need help to deal with this and any advice/experience on this will be much appreciated.",1
"I'm 15, and i have a feeling I have anger issues.
Basically when i was younger, 10-12 i would get beaten all the time at school and all that, so i started taking martial arts more seriously. I had done it before but i was like ""ahhh what ever"" but then i started taking it seriously. At about 12 i started fighting back, and a lot. Id, of course, my luck, be the only one who got in any trouble, and I hated my life. Tried to you know end it at age 13 and that sucked. Got my life back on track, but then my family started being into play.

Now I love my family, but I'm Slavic, and in my culture, especially my family's, they do not take kindly to any weakness. So my father, especially, hated it and he never supported me and all that, so that's when i started street fighting with some now buddies.

Now i met up all the time at night and stuff and we would fight, id have to sneak out just to see em, and wed wear gloves and all that but it was still really intense. I got my anger out at a shitty day or shitty talk with the parents like that. Fast forward now, and all I am, is angry. I'm always like getting headaches, even neausia sometimes you know. What scared me is a couple months ago my chest started tightening, and a whole bunch of other things, like it would hurt to breathe. I wasn't even like mad I'd just feel sick, i had to skip school it was god awful. And of course that didnt help with my father of course. I was always tired or had some nervous energy of some kind. Now recently, I got blamed for something some other people did and basically was humiliated into withdrawing from hs. That obviously didn't help. T

The one time I've felt reasonably okay is when some fellas jumped me and tried to like rob me and whatever and I had to defend myself, I felt at peace, because i was not angry, i was doing something. Came out relatively clean, all that, no charges, its whatever. What should i do fellas?

Get help? At this point I'll just kill myself if that'll help because i genuinely don't care to live in such a shitty society. Or is it society's fault and my brains fucked up and i just need a pill or a shot or somthin? Help me out here boys and girls.",1
"Sorry if this is awkward,  but I want some answers. I don’t know if it’s a phase but for a couple years now I’ve been really tempted to hurt people I even fantasize beating or killing people I dislike. The other day I beat up another person and it gave me great satisfaction I wanted to do it again. All the anger that I had built up was gone after I beat him up, but only for a short time I felt amazing. Is this normal for anyone else?",1
"This is just terrible and I feel like the worst person. I really want to just kill myself so I don’t have to feel so guilty. My mother has anger issues too and since my father left her for another woman, she says he doesn’t love me and she tries to justify his drug and alcohol problems.  
Recently she has been working and going to church (even though she’s made my dad lose his two jobs) we have had short fights but nothing too big. I lose control when she’s drunk or stoned. I really feel angry because she used to beat me up for no reason when I was a child and she was in that condition. There’s a lot of traumatic episodes of her being drunk and the things she says are the worst, she always yelled me that I’m an unlovable thing and that I should get a life, that she’s not the mother everyone has. I try to take all her stuff because I feel afraid that she’s getting drugs and overdose (we had to take her to er before). Today was the last time I stopped her for leaving the house while she was drunk. Since I was a child I’ve had to go with my dad in the middle of the night just to take her home. It doesn’t justify the way I treated her either, but I really don’t know what to do, it worries me that she’s intoxicating or doing drugs, I didn’t want this to happen and I feel guilty for screaming that I wish she was dead.  Now I’m gonna live with my brother (who’s also physically and verbally abusive) in this house alone. No one likes me in my family, they think I’m insane because I act with uncontrollable sadness and anger since they separated.",1
"I live in rural India. More like I'm exiled here, but that's a whole different story. I rescued a hapless kitten last year around this time from the incessant rains and it grew to be a nice healthy cat and a month back it had 2 babies. Last night it was ambushed by some stray dogs while I was sleeping. The cat usually ventures out at night and sleeps during the day, it's very hard to stop it from getting out because the house that I live in is very dilapidated and worn out, so there are cracks and crevices through which it can always get out but not so easily get back in. I'm guessing it sneaked out last night and during its late night adventures it must've gotten cornered by these huge ass stray dogs. Man I hate them to death, they've been roaming around the estate for way too long and have always destroyed plants and whatever we plant in the fields, they've even sometimes snuck into out storage area to lay waste to the entire place doing God knows what in there. I should've taken care of these feral dogs. I should've known. But I never thought my healthy and agile cat would ever be one to shy away from an encounter. This one was always extremely limber and extremely quick in its movements. Nevertheless the first thing I saw today morning upon waking up and taking a stroll through my garden is it's dead and unmoving body. Needless to say it wasn't bloodied, it looked like a case of broken neck or crushed windpipe. The corpse had turned rigid. I had to dig a deep grave because of the rains which would always fill any shallow pit and I buried it. Put a few heavy stones on top of it to help the wet sand settle and prevent these fucking dogs from exhuming it at night when everyone's asleep. I don't know what I must do. I never was too playful with the cat but I always fed it the best food(meat and fish) and gave it all the comfort it can get in a house. Now all I have are those two kittens in its stead. I feel like I must send away these kittens to others who may be more inclined to raise them.

Those dogs are getting it soon.",1
"Some background, I have a high blood pressure despite being relatively young. I have been told to have anger issues from a young age and used to attend school counseling for anger issues.

Now I’m currently in Uni and it’s not exactly that bad, it’s just that when things don’t exactly work out for me I either get anxious or angry. It applies to the small things as well, say my internet doesn’t seem to be working on my phone I’d get extra and would actually bang it on anything really if there isn’t anyone around (I don’t wanna look crazy lol).

What I really want to know is if you guys know how to calm down from situations like those, because once I get angry my blood pressure rises and I can’t seem to focus on anything and just feel bad for a while.",1
"When I get mad,I go over the top. I just want to kill them and make them suffer. I’m obsessed with murders and I want them to suffer. I talked to my therapist and she said to use a stress ball. But someday I’m scared I’m going to hurt someone very badly in a fit of anger. Please help me. I’m scared",1
"I hate doing my bills.  Some, like my car payment aren’t so bad.  I feel like the cost of the car is justified.

Others like my rent make me super angry.  I’m angry that my job brought me to a place that is super expensive to live in.  I’m angry that I’m having such a hard time getting ahead financially.

I hope no one hears me while I’m doing my bills, they might call the cops.",1
"Sometimes when I get angry It lasts less than a minute but I literally feel buzzing, tingling, and what I assume is an adrenaline rush throughout my body. Then I go about the rest of my day like normal, maybe it's more of a mood swing?",1
"Hello, all

First off, I'd like to thank you all for being so supportive and for allowing me this opportunity to discuss my anger issues with people who've been through it/are knowledgeable about it. Thank you for reading this post and I apologize for how long it is.

First off a small background: I live in a third world country where I constantly feel like my mental is under duress, whether it's from the fact that we don't have sustained access to proper infrastructure/services (bad roads, electricity outages, trash internet) or from the hostility people hold for each other, especially when driving. It angers me a lot that for me to play an online game, I have to factor in electricity/internet and use my mobile data to be able to just login. Families mean nothing here and brothers back stab brothers for money and never regret it. I am lucky to have a good nuclear family in this environment.

Growing up, I would often get disappointed (by people/events) and so I would repress my emotions. That was my coping mechanism, and honestly I thought it was working. It got to a point where I could express  neither good nor bad emotions. It took me 18 years to tell my parents and sister that I love them, and it still feels difficult to say it sometimes. Recently, the way I have been dealing with my emotions is by turning them to hate and anger.

I hate everyone around me in this country. I had the chance to do a year abroad and it opened my eyes to how emotionally incapable I had become, but I still did not learn how to deal with my emotions and so the hate and anger got fed more and more. I am controlling, and if things don't go my way I get so angry and I moralize/justify everything to say that I am right and people are wrong. It has become an unconscious reaction for me to hate and get angry at people.

The anger is manifesting itself mostly in 2 ways: my driving, and my communication. When I'm driving, as long as everything is okay, I drive normal, but then something happens (a guy tries to cut me off, someone tries to play chicken with me so he can get past the people in his lane) and I snap and turn ultra violent, and I try to harm them. I used to justify this by saying that they want to hurt me, so why should I not hurt them.

In communicating, I am very impulsive and incapable of emotional control/thinking when I'm angry. This has manifested itself the most when I'm discussing critical issues with my girlfriend or my dad, where I'd be talking about something and my intensity rises so much that I feel like I am boiling and need to explode. It has also manifested itself in my favorite video game where I now have gotten my 10th chat ban and 5th suspension. I do not want to hate/be angry but I do it just the same. I am incapable of stopping it, the anger just takes control of my life and I can't act outside of it. My head feels like it's going to burst and my body tenses.

I have talked to my dad about it. Apparently it has been an issue in his side of the family for a while. My uncle actually died because of it, his heart just stopped because of how much pressure would build up in his body.

I have just recently accepted a job position as a staff writer/editor, and I am afraid that if I don't deal with this issue it will ruin my life and any chance I have at leaving this God forsaken country and establishing a proper life with my significant other.

How do I deal with this issue? should I see a counselor? We have a counselling center at uni that I can go to, but I have been trying to avoid that. I've been trying to control it/talk to myself about it but it hasn't been working. I already have hobbies. I work out and play music but those don't seem to be mitigating the anger. In general, I am actually a jokey/positive person and so it feels like I have two different faces.",1
"I'm on mobile and my last post got lost....I'm so very frustrated. 

Got in a fight with my significant other other about dishes. Honestly I'm so sick of getting angry about this stupid crap, but i have such a habit of suppressing my emotions that it boils over. I want her to clean up after herself from breakfast and morning with our daughter. Then, i need time after dinner to wash the dinner dishes. That's it, but simple messages don't communicated. They lost because i start raising muy voice. She says something that hurts my feelings and i start losing my cool. Then i yell and scream stop! I say no that's not what I meant! Can we please get to all actual resolution over this??? I don't want to yell in front of my daughter and I don't want to yell at my significant other. I don't want to yell. I just start feeling the need to defend myself. Then at the end i feel insanely guilty about losing my control. :/",1
"I have been married for a short period of time and my anger has been getting out of control. My husband does things sometimes that are not even a big deal and I get so easily angry and aggressive. I feel like something takes over me some type of demonic thing and I get blinded and even hit him and scream like a psychopath. Then after, I feel stupid and regret it because after I analyze the situation most of the time it was not even that serious. Its affecting my relationship and I don’t know what I can do to control it. I have tried praying, walking away, and things like that, but most of the time it happens so fast that I don’t even have time to do any of those things. Then less than thirty minutes after I am back to normal like nothing happened. Can anyone relate?",1
"I don't know what happened. As a kid, I could sit and wait in line for hours without a cell phone. Now small things like losing in Smash Ultimate make me want to scream.",1
"That pretty much says it. The smallest things set me off. I think it's a control issue for me. If I dont have control of a situation or plans are different than how I planned them out. All bets are off. I've broken dishes, ruined pictures I'll never get back, cut myself, put holes in the wall all over.... well I dont remember now. Is it the weed or was the problem so insignificant it doesn't matter? I dont know. I really dont. I hate myself when I'm angry and even worse I cannot communicate when I'm angry. I can say things like ""I dont feel good"" or ""I'm mad"" but if you want to know what set me off give me an hour or two to pout or worse go off on things before I can calm down and tell you. I dont know where to begin helpingmyself. I count to 5. That's helpful when I start to panic. I count and let myself look again. Odds are I find my glasses or keys in less than a minute. But if I'm angry there's no getting through to me. My boyfriend has tried to help and asks what he can say or do but I hesitate to tell him anything because in the heat of the moment a ""calm down babe"" sounds condescending and I'm not hearing it. I guess this is just a rant. I really dont know how to carry myself.",1
"When I start to get really worked up or stressed out, my right eye starts to hurt. Only the right eye, never my left. The more angry I get, the more intense the pain, until it feels like it's going to explode right out of my head. It can last for days. Does anyone else experience this, or pains similar to this?",1
"Today a conflict happened between my father and sister... both have super hot heads 😡

the conflict went on so severely that my sister got almost faint due to rage 🔥

After a couple of hours of suggestions from my mother and my sister's husband got her calm down and her health restored 

Our entire family is now worried about this issue of her... she has a super low anger tolerance 

Any suggestions how can I help her to control this 🙏",1
"I’m realizing that becoming a calm person means the fear of being passive. That I have to work on. Having said that, I’m finding that I am observing more in those around me. And sometimes those observations can be annoying. However this can be your strength. So where do I go from here?",1
"It sounds messed up, but it's true. I think it is interfering with me being more assertive. It's because I'm always afraid that either the outcome is going to be worst case scenario and I'm just going to end up thrown to the lion's den, or I'm going to lose my temper and actually try to kill someone.

I try meditation and positive thinking, but they seem to fail whenever I really have to start a conflict with someone over something important.

I always find myself backing down out of cowardice and becoming increasingly resentful and wishful of violence as a result.",1
"I understand that the person is apologetic and maybe rightfully so but it feels like they don't mean it or they should be apologizing profusely with more effort and more heart into it. They must be truly sorry for their wrongdoings and just not say it to get on with their lives.

Their apology seems halfhearted and that angers me more. Instead of me wanting to accept their apology, I try to force out an even wholehearted one which ends up culminating in a huge fight altogether.",1
"Well, this is my first post here, so, if this sub isn't for what I think it is please tell me. 

I have anger rages against my family, a lot, not someone in particular, against my mom, dad, brother and sister sometimes. My mood changes drastically after only one question and it keeps that way for a while (2 or 3 hours), it doesn't matter if I'm on a good mood or I'm having the best day of my life, if a family member asks me something about my job, school or relationship I instantly go into some mad man tone and start yelling at them. I don't why this happens only with them. Doesn't happen with friends, only with my siblings and parents.


Somebody please give me some advice on how to manage my anger, and how to evade those situations. 


Pd. I talked with everybody alone and politely told them I have this problem, everybody except my mom told me to stop being ridiculous.",1
"TL;DR I want to help my boyfriend with his anger and aggressive thoughts  and overthinking situations, but I don’t know how?


My boyfriend has a lot of anger built up inside him, due to a lot of personal shit that has affected his family ( I won’t go into detail but one of his siblings experienced extreme sexual violence and he resents the fact that the perpetrators went unpunished).

The issue is that whenever he feels a guy is disrespecting me, he will work himself up and keep himself up at night worrying about it and wanting to do something.

We spoke last night and he hates all these overly aggressive thoughts that consume him; I tell him that I am unbothered by people’s words and that they can’t harm us but it doesn’t seen to make him feel better.

I just don’t know how to help/what will help him. Have suggested physical exercise and we have briefly mentioned meditation.

How do I help?",1
"I am angry and filled with rage all the time. I’m depressed and anxious and every day it gets worse. Nothing helps. I hate everyone and everything. I used to be such a carefree and happy person and all of that is gone. I hate being around people, I hate seeing other people’s faces, and I hate doing anything. I place most of the blame on my job, which I also hate (surprise surprise) and I have been trying to get out of it for three years with no luck which makes me even more frustrated. I get even more angry when people tell me to take a break or breathe or meditate or focus on the good. Help. I want my old self back, I’m so sick of being this monster. :((((((",1
"I used to have a best friend. Let’s call him H. These days, H is ignoring me, and whenever I move close to him he moves away. He doesn’t answer my texts on purpose, even though he reads them, and not much better in person either. I feel SO angry. Like I want to punch him or something.",1

"As a child i was bullied and seen differently to the other children as i was quite shy and lacking in confidence, i always felt like i wasn't good enough/smart enough to compete with the other children in my school so i would close myself off only keeping a handful of friends who wouldn't criticize me on my lack of interest in schooling.

I fell behind because i believed i wasn't born 'smart' and i fell behind because i was treated differently. For a while i tried to socialise but rejected and made fun of so i became bitter and angry, i would get into fights and go into rages blacking out only to awake and see what i had done was nearly kill my class mate, people would ask me to bully other children and for a while i enjoyed this new sense of power over the other kids, i don't look strong or big but i believe i have acquired retard strength from being in a constant state of mild rage.

This all changed when i was 7 when my headmaster told me he would expell me and send me to a 'naughty' school if i acted out again on the other children, since then (im 19) i haven't got into a proper physical fight and when i had (only once) i carried this psyche that i would get told off if i had another fight so i hardly put up a fight and got beaten, i again didn't excel in school and would get into trouble over homework issues, the teachers especially my sports teacher made my life hell (he was imposing and would always be there when i failed)

I left at 16 then went to college, i did really well in college and as the years went on i gained confidence in myself again and at 18 i became more assertive but would always back from a fight because of that psyche however that mild sense of rage was always there.

Then my sister died in febraury a month before my birthday, i cried and cried, and started to see how arbitrary and short life is and that i needed to make a goal in life and stop holding onto my last psyche of being scared something would happen to me if i act against someone abusing me.

As of may onwards i have been having a 1000 yard stare while on the train thinking of ways im going to kill someone (i do a manual labour job and sometimes get dirty so people sometimes stand away from me (smell and all i can't help it after sweating like a pig) 

I feel like people alienate me and treat me like shit, however it got worse just two days ago when my 'friend' started to smack me on the face after i talked about my favourite topic with my bud who asked me about it (i didn't bring it up he did) but the 'friend' got annoyed with me saying that its all i speak about so while he was mid smacking me i grabbed his hand and smacked him lightly back half jokingly half im about to kill you kinda way, he continued smacking me but then my retard strength came back and i grabbed his hand and broke it, everyone was shocked and my friends are either scared of me or think me an asshole, they haven't spoken to me since.

i was shaking uncontrollably my jaw rattling, i was nearly going to kill him, i was going to throw him across the room and snap his back, i instead just walked out of the pub, im afraid if anyone annoys me again im going to do something i'll regret

I've noticed i've turned into an asshole and that the daily grind of work, commuting and people in general are wearing me down, anyone else feel this way? Why do people treat each other like this? Why do this? Humans are sick and its rubbing off on me again.",1
"I am not sure if my anger is due to my PTSD or something else. I was physically, emotionally, and sexually abused growing up. I have escaped predatory ""friends"", dangerous roommates, and a bad childhood (with abuse happening at the hands of my parents and siblings).

All I have left is PTSD, depression, few friends, low motivation, a stressful love life, low self-esteem, bitterness, and a career that is stessful. I have so much bitterness from my life and current relationship. I hate having to carry everything.

I have had jobs that were incredibly stressful and was pretty upset all the time. After a period where my previous job was okay, but then the stress and isolation caused me to have horrible, frightening delusions.

Now, that I have escaped that, I find that this new job brings out my anger, especially since day one involved a coworker that has treated me cruelly. 

I am not even sure if it is PTSD-related, but I find myself angry. It's a vicious cycle. I feel happy when acknowledged and continue to complain and rant and expect my partner to continue being engaged. I rant forever about things and then if I do not feel sated or the other person listening isn't supportive enough after listening for a long time, I then feel angrier and feel like they are just no longer on my side.  This is with my partner. I am really ashamed of this behavior. It's unhealthy. I am not like this with friends, but do rant sometimes.

At work, where most of my anger is triggered, I will rant to my officemate (we both rant, but I let it keep me negative), sometimes make passive aggressive remarks and be obstinate with people who I have felt have disrespected me at my worst. At the beginning, I rant and speak curtly and in a monotone. It's getting bad and I know that I can't keep this up professionally, but I don't know what to do. I feel like I have started to become angrier after taking all of my boyfriend's explosive outbursts at the beginning of the relationship six years ago. He has since calmed down, but I have become very bitter and angry. Sometimes, music helps, but I still feel that when I feel anger coming on I have to feed it.

What should I do? I apologize if this is the wrong place.",1
I came off paxil about a month ago. I had previously been taking it for 23 years. The anger issues are there. There are just times when they seem to come out of no where and I just explode. Does anyone else have these problems?,1
"I am in a long distance relationship with my partner. It started gradually in last 1 year. I keep yelling at people, mostly at close people. Small small things trigger it. I go into fight mode. Sometimes it's just other people's opinion or criticism. Other thing I have noticed is I keep defending the things I admire, I am not patient with other people's opposite opinions about those things. And long distance relationship is making the situation worse.
I was not like this before. Having a good conversation has become very difficult for me these days. Something triggers my anger and next whole conversation I'll object every point of next person. So become so hyper that I burst into tears at the end. I will yell, I will hit something or I will break something. I want to get out of this misery and stop hurting people around me. Any guidance is welcome.",1
I’m not sure if my lack of productivity in life is the cause of my anger and depression or visa versa. Either way it would’ve great to fix this problem.,1
"Ok so basically I’m going to tell you about my life sorry if it’s long. So basically my mother has major anger issues she storms off out of the house constantly is gone for like 3 hours if I misunderstand her, she has even went and stayed with my grandparents for a whole weekend after cussing me out for correcting her just to make sure I understood what she was saying. I have tried talking to her about it before but it just starts a huge fight. She is a smoker she already smokes like 2 or 3 packs a day when she gets angry she doesn’t even come inside all day she will probably smoke like 5 packs or so. She is so addicted to this game on her phone and iPad that she can’t even put it down to cook dinner sometimes. She is so addicted to her game that she spends 45 dollars a week on iTunes cards at the store without my dad knowing, she also gets 20 dollars cash back every week. My dad knows about it and he has tried talking to her about stop getting the iTunes cards and cash at the store and she has threatened to divorce him. I’m not going to say exactly home much my dad makes but he makes low 6 digits so we should have plenty of money right? Wrong. Because if my moms money spending on stupid things we can’t even take a vacation we took our first ever vacation last year and it’s because I had to compete in a pool tournament. My dad is trying to save up for a new car(because his is a stick shift and his back is getting bad and he can’t drive it anymore) and because of my moms money spending he can’t afford it she has an Audi and my dad is trying to save up to get and Audi but my mom throws a fit about it’s to expensive even though she wastes money all the time. My dad is not going to be able to retire because of her money spending and this is the only thing he wants is a new car but my mom throws a fit about. So because of all of the things above my mom does it makes me want to kill my self. She in my opinion doesn’t take care of me the way she should. But anyway I just wrote that to see if any person could help me any help is appreciated thanks. And for those of you who are wondering I’m 14 my dad is 54 and my mom is 46. So yea any advice is helpful. Thanks.",1
"I have an INCREDIBLY complicated relationship with my twin sister. We're both stubborn people so it's hard to communicate sometimes.

I've been able to control my anger for months now and I've been very calm and happy. However, tonight, my sister and I had a conversation where we were both getting defensive about our own opinions. She ended the conversation by saying that we should stop talking about [lists topics, such as graduate school and vacations] because she couldn't handle it anymore.

That started my anger meter, but I tried to keep it in control because I understand that I was being defensive, too. It was a sucky situation overall, and I didn't want to escalate it. 

After a while, she started talking about how she wanted to move out after university and room with one of our close friends. I made a comment in a not-so-nice tone saying ""guess I would have to find a separate place, eh?"" and she's like ""well, yeah, obviously.""

My anger meter was going up and up and up and I couldn't control it. I snapped and told her that while I understand why she wants to move away, it still hurt to be told that your twin wants to distance herself from you. As I'm saying this, I **KNOW** that this is **PRECISELY** the reason she wants to distance herself from me, and I'm hating every minute of it.

The conversation ended with her walking away from me. I went to my room and started throwing pillows against the wall, chanting ""STOP, STOP, STOP"" to myself because I knew I was snapping. She came in, saw me punching pillows, and gave me a look that will haunt me forever. She shook her head in exasperation, ""tsked"", and said, ""Everyone in this house has problems!""

I ended up having to take a walk (it was 3AM at this point), that's how angry I was. I came back home and I'm sobbing now. I'm a terrible person. No wonder she wants to distance herself from me. I'm terrible and even by saying all this ""self-hating"" stuff that I know pisses my sister off is making me hate myself. I'm angry and sad and don't know what to do.",1
Did not do this for months. Then someone started talking shit like a fucking middleschooler and because it is a bitch I can't just beat the shit out of this person. Then there was an exam I failed and it got too much because there is also problems at home and too little time for interests at the moment.,1
"I feel robbed, like a victim. I am NOT a victim, but I feel like I'm being treated like one. Some bad shit has happened to me in the past--getting raped, being homeless--and I didn't have any family and close ones to call on for help outside from my parents. All my so-called friends were unable to help me.
I use video games as an escape method, and even there I get picked on, disrespected and treated like shit. They created lies about me and made a reputation that I'm this awful and bad person, and it's all a bunch of fucking lies, I tell you. They're fucking ASSHOLES. I HATE THIS POSITION I AM IN LIFE, and it feels like there's NOTHING I can do to change it. I wish I could be more coherent and more detailed with the things I am saying, but honestly, I feel like a tortured soul. I have my flaws, but I'm not an asshole, unless you are one to me. ""Treat others how you want to be treated,"" right? Apparently fucking not.

I have nothing. No money, no car, no job, no fucking reason to live. I'm 25 years old, and I feel suicidal. I want help but I know I am not getting it. That makes me SO FUCKING ANGRY. I HATE EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW. THIS IS SUCH BULLSHIT.",1
"When I get mad for one reason or another (hunger, failure, authority, etc) i get suspicious of my friends thinking they must hate me now that I’m angry. I get paranoid that they talk behind my back and then I get angrier. Not at them, just at the world and myself for being angry and disappointing the people I love. I am 99.99% my paranoia is unfounded, but I can’t seem to communicate that to my brain and I just get more angry :/",1
"Is it normal to want to get yelled at all the time? I was always yelled at through life just at the littlest things ever. If I don’t get yelled at, I’ll find something to do that will get me yelled at, because it feels out of place to not be yelled at for me.",1
I just wanted to know if there's a good way to calm down after getting angry. I just get angry a lot and want to calm down. I can't help it.,1
"I'm a fuckup. I ruin EVERYTHING I touch. Relationships, friendships, etc. And it's all because whenever I'm happy it's when I tinker but I can only do it one hour a day every other week.

But I feel so goddamn angry and afraid all the time. Am I not perfect? Does someone notice something bad about me? Who is gonna tell at me today?

"He guys, sorry to join and vent need an outlet. 

Backstory of tonight (moments ago);

- out for dinner with wife
- downtown 3 larger guys, young 30s I'd say but decent sized, sitting at top of subway station, drinking, pan handling the usual
- asked for money, we politely said sorry and as we kept walking one of em said 'cause if you pay me I won't have to come into your house at night in a Bella clava and...'

Ok. It was six pm and daylight middle of downtown. I'm with wife what can I do. We keep walking. I deal with assholes all the time downtown and lots of innapropriate comments, usually one off.

We go out eat go home. It's now 10:15pm. She's in bed and I say I'm gonna go grab a wine at the local joint. I was...kinda. it's been on my mind. This city is a warzone but I have to have a line, no? I turn around half way to restaurant and caught the train back downtown 2 stops. As I run up the stairs low and behold, the 3 pied pipers still sitting at the top.

I said 'hey you guys need some money, member me?!' then just all out laid into them like 10 aggression. Fist back saying if I ever say them or they threatened me again I'd smash every bone in they're face yadda yadda yadda. 40 seconds later I guess I missed an undercover. 4 cop cars. 2 then 2 more. 8 cops. By then I'd have gone from a high ten aggression to an 8. But still had to be ready if it popped off. They were 3 I was one. And I was bringing it to them.

Cops took my name and let me go after I explained it.
I've been in many street fight before. Many. But not in a long time. Years. And I'm older now so I can't and shouldn't. I'm not even in good shape.

The comments they made, felt so threatening in the moment and I was helpless to even talk to them. Would have probably even been a waste of time. Even walking to have a wine the anger was boiling up. Still when my line gets crossed and that's an aggregious line, I have a hard time cooling it. 

It was highly dangerous and wife is mad at me. Was this anger issues rearing it's head or my 0-10 temper when I feel ppl have acted unjustly, the number one reason by far for most of my 2 decades of fighting (a fight say once every year in twenties then every CPL yrs to 30's). Now not so much at all truly.

Thanks for any help. I feel I did the right thing but I also feel there might be still unchecked untold old anger that sits inside and literally that could have been a messy night.",1
"I’ve always had anger issues I get mad at tiny things and I lash out at people without thinking. I say really terrible things under my breath to people that i love really horrible things.
Sometimes I will focus on such a small situation and get so mad at myself for letting it happen. And then I get mad for being angry and acting the way I do. This happens every once in a while but recently it’s been happening almost everyday. I just sit there in my room getting more and more angry until I start crying. I know there’s something wrong with me I hate myself so much. I get so upset at everything that happens but everything is my own fault. I just really really want it to go away",1
"Tl;dr

I’ve been an asshole to my wife too many times. I got better but not 100%. Sex was infrequent and I had to shut myself off from her emotionally so rejection wouldn’t hurt as much. Confronted wife about it, she was an asshole to me. Sad and confused. Need help.

Long version.

With no particular pattern, sometimes I will get aggressive (standing up, talking down, raising voice) when something makes me angry. Usually directed at my wife. When I get like this I will try to leave the situation so I can go calm down but that usually leads to more problems/bickering which leads to more anger.

My wife calls this my “disproportional reaction” thing, and it forces her to walk on eggshells around me. It has had a huge impact on our lives and has put a bunch of stress on our marriage/family.

We’re both in our early thirties and we’ve been together for so long that while this might have been a deal breaker for some one else, she’s stuck with me.

My dad has BPD. Verbal abuse and scariness was basically the example I had growing up... my wife and I both know it and I think my willingness to be extremely open about it and actively working on it has been my saving grace.

We’ve been to couples therapy and that helped a bit with general communication techniques.

When our kid was born that helped a lot because I think something inside me changed, biochemically- though I have no real evidence, life just feels different.

So now I blow up a lot less frequently, but when I do, the intensity is still there. And my wife’s memories are still there of all the times I fucked up, so it’s an uphill battle trying to be good for a long enough time that those wounds can heal.

To be clear my goal is to be fully “good” but it’s hard fighting these patterns as I’m sure some of you can relate to.

Our sex life has pretty much not met my needs since we’ve been married but relatively speaking it was medium to low in terms of relative importance to me vs having a supportive partner and mother of my child so I’ve left it alone for a while.

Things have been good for two years, on the whole, and CBT has definitely helped. I continue to see a person myself every two weeks. I’ve had maybe 3 of these blow up incidents in the last two years. 

On the sex side, it has been really hard for me. I’m high labido. Wife is low labido. Her labido is partially due to my anger, but also normal post child stuff, as well as generalized anxiety disorder.

So last night I was fed up with her (from her perspective, totally innocent) jokes about our dead bedroom so I said something snarky and she forced it out of me. 

I told her how I was feeling, was vulnerable, cried. She yelled at me, was not empathetic at all and kept talking about why it was so hard for her to feel horny because of my anger and all the other things making her anxious... when I was just trying to share how it was making me feel and wanted her to listen.

She was so effing mean to me I couldn’t believe it... she was so cold about the whole thing, and now I’m just lost. 

The thing that makes it so much more painful is that the way she treated me is definitely how I’ve treated her in the past about her anxiety when I was less aware of how hard her struggle was, and before we went to therapy and had kids... so it’s kind of like I deserved it? Maybe I can use it as motivation to get fully better myself?

Either way the deal breaker for her right now is that my disproportionate reactions are still keeping her from feeling fully safe around me.

I need help not spiraling down into the darkness between now and next therapy session... 

any guidance from anyone that can relate would be appreciated.",1
"There are days when I just don feel myself and im just not the happy person I usually am. Then my mom walks in the room constantly bringing up my weight. I lose five lbs then gain 6 oz...its unacceptable. I cry screaming for her to stop as she brings u other things. I start digging my thumb nail into my wrist wispering ""please stop, please stop, please...etc."" until it gets quite and I hear her slam the door on her way out. I already feel like shit, but then she tells my dad what happened. He yells at me. He's not angry at me, but at our bickering. The thought of him being stressed from me or upset fucking kills me. I leave to my room, all I think to do is punish myself. I punch myself in the legs and punch my own arms. Then me sitting in the corner next the night stand crying is all that's left by the end.",1
"There are some people who pop up in my mind and how they behaved with me in the past. It gets me really mad. Especially considering what I did for them. One of these people is a close relative of mine. I wont go into details about who he is and what he did in the past because thats another discussion.

I try to avoid it and I am successfull on most days but within a week there is always a moment when I accidentally start thinking about it and I think about the exact dialog I would have with that person in the future or how exactly he behaved with me in the past . What would I say to him? Or how they treated me. This happens so quickly (in a matter of minutes) that I would have a healthy blood pressure in the morning and in the evening my bp would shoot up. This causes me to eat bp medicine which makes me weak and I get too weak to do my daily workouts. 

How do I stop this? Please help me control my anger.",1
"let me start off i get really angry where i dont know how to form good sentences and that pisses me off even more, it doesnt help when im not getting things done right specially multiple times. making this post to ask for help on where i can get help with starting to draw again after many years that ive stopped. it might have helped me in the years i was doing it but worry ill start to jinx myself and will scare and piss me off more. ive noticed i get mad way too much when i cant do something right and i know thisll happen too when i try to start and draw. ill get let down, ill throw fits yes.. and try to keep it from getting bad so i dont embarrass myself and thats hard within itself. can somebody help me with where i can find help in drawing again. im overwhelmed",1
"That's the only thing that gets me when I drive. Changing lanes is so scary and no one usually makes it easier. I keep my cool by tapping my left foot on that one part for the left foot, since I drive automatic. Love the sublimation/tension release of that. Today I lost my cool, though. What do you do when you lose your cool when you could've sublimated?",1
"I have this thing when either I'm accused of something I didn't do or I was wronged and the person plays dumb, I get into a fit of rage. 
For example:
My aunt accused me of not telling her that I was failing a class(which is true). Then, I got upset and disappointed in myself, that I would lie to my aunt. But she took it as me getting upset and crying as, I wasn't sorry that I did it, I was sorry that I got caught. Then my face got red and hot, to the point that my nose started to bleed. She then started laughing and basically making fun of how I was really upset about me getting caught. 
( this is where my snarky attitude / angriness comes in)
I then proceed to say I don't care / whatever. She then says that I'm just like my mom(my mom is definitely not the greatest person and I would not like to be compared to her). Then I go ballistic like I usually do. Fast forward a little bit, I'm in my room, crying saying why do I always have to be such a bad person. Basically putting myself down, telling myself stop, calm down, stop getting angry but then I always go to the why am I even here, why am I still alive, why am I still such a problem.


In conclusion, I can't seem to calm myself down even when it comes to my grandma. She always gets me angry somehow, whether it has to do with calling me a pig or her saying that she never said anything of the sort,  any name-calling. She all sudden doesn't even remember even though it happened a minute before. They say she has Alzheimer's and I can believe that to certain degree, but other times I think she just uses that and then she pretends "" oh my head hurts"" because of my yelling, and yet she herself is always yelling, and then she tries to hit me and that's when I'm like no don't you fucking dare. 


But that doesn't really matter what I need help with is controlling my anger if anyone could give me some tips that would be very appreciated. 
Thanks🙇",1
"It seems like no matter what I do today, I get yelled at. It’s been like this since I woke up this morning. I really hate being yelled at by everyone around me and they all know that I have anger issues and no one seems to care. It makes me just want to walk away, or yell back. I just want to do anything to get them to stop and I’m so angry about it, they only way I can think to resolve it is violence.",1
"Me and I gf, we just started yet another fight.

I've been getting psychological consoling for 3 about years, every time when things seemed to be getting better, they just didn't( btw that shit ain't cheap ). 

The therapist said I have a big problem with my grudge held against my family, which I have to resolve to really get out of my nightmares. Oh how I hate my family, but that's for another time.

My gf is( or was ) my savior, I had the reason to live because of her. But how things changed through out the years we've been together.

Tonight she was doing some online Black Friday thingy, she had to buy a few things more to get a discount. She wanted the purchase to be JUUUST enough to get a discount, and that was quite some brainworks.

At the last 5 minutes she started asking for my advice, anxiously, fearing that she might lose that f***ing discount ( we're not tight on budget btw, getting discounts is just her .... thing ).

At the last 1 minute I said ""You might want to buy the cheapest few things in your cart and ...""( return them after they've arrived ). 

But I got shushed, and little bit irritated, so I 
shut up, sighed through my nostrils, and shaked my head.

But then she started yelling at me, blaming me for giving advice at the last minute, and on and on...

I shushed her, and she got even more agitated, yelling even louder.

I looked at my watch and said ""Shut your mouth and make the purchase, we still have time"", she then yelled a few times more, to which I responded with ""Just shut up and do your thing!""

( Oh well.... )

It escalated quickly, we were all spitting fire at each other, though she never used any bad words. But I, oh how stupid, I said ""You piece of SHIT, you RUBBISH!"" with a few repetitions, because I thought it was so unfair that she could blame/yell at me out of nowhere.

Now she's sad, she hates me. We're living in the same room but we're not talking.

I hate it but I just can't resist. I overreact, but even if I overreacted, I could've avoid saying hurtful things... right?

Things like this happen more and more often, like 2-3 times a week, tolerance between us lessened day after day.

( I tried to follow guidelines on ""If it hurts, it's not love"", but I only ended up being the one who received more toxicities, and she being more inconsiderate, but that's not what I want to talk about. )

What should I do now? I'm still angry, angry at her starting the fight and ignoring me afterwards when I tried to really talk, angry at myself being a dumbass &amp; saying hurtful things.

Please help.

Tldr: Me and my gf had a fight, I said hurtful words. She's sad and hates me now, and she wouldn't talk, what should I do?",1
"Yesterday i was picking my son up from school, he's 16 years old and autistic, goes to a special ed class in the same school as the rest of the high school students. When i arrived to pick him up in the parking lot i overheardheard 2 highschoolers (which he has told me occasionally picks on him if he is alone) calling him a retard as he was walking to our car. 

I stepped out of our car to give him a hand but when i noticed he was crying and them just standing there laughing i suddenly just snapped. Ever since i had him i've learned to control my temper and be as patient as possible, but this just made me so furious i diddnt know what to do. I saw red and charged the one who called him retarded, grabbed him by his neck and pushed him to the ground, accidentally hitting his head on the pavement. I'm a big man, but i didnt intend to hurt the kid, just push him to the ground and intimidate him. 

I decided to stay there and try to help him since i didnt know if i had seriously hurt him or not, and fortunately he didnt get hurt, a very mild concussion at worst. However the kid started yelling that he was gonna tell his parents i randomly assaulted and beat him and all that stuff. The only witnesses there was my son the other kid, but he's obviously not gonna side with us.

I'm about to call his parents and see if we can solve this like adults, but im really scared of getting sued or even arrested.

Anyone else had to deal with somethign like this, and how did it go?",1
"I’m 16 and live with both my parents and have done for as long as I have been alive. I have a dad who shouts, who shouts a lot and hard.
For context my earliest memory is when he begun shouting at me for and the hitting me across the face. I have no idea at what age this happened but I’m guessing around 8-9 due to where we lived. This hasn’t stopped and has happened for just about every conversation we have had for years  in which I never reply or insult him back after he shouts although he hasn’t hit me in a long time since I’m pretty sure he is aware that I’m much stronger than him and could easily fight back.
Fortunately he never involves my mother or my sister although gets set off by them both sometimes but then finds some excuse to shout at me for half an hour whilst I just take it.
Today I fought back, It was a build up of anger that I can’t begin to describe that I had hidden and brushed under the carpet for years which just came out. I told him everything and how I fucking hated and don’t respect him and haven’t for years though once again have never shown or acted upon this feeling, I told him how he never has never brought anything but pain into my life which he fucking chocked for years with his animalistic nature towards me and broke down the scenario for every conversation we have together.
I think my younger self considered this to be normal for a while but kind of through time, I put together the pieces like I saw people shout at each other for years and how people got angry and make each other cry sometimes with near to no shouting or more importantly, the fact that my grandparents on both time have individually said that he’s to harsh or mean to me but he has never shouted at me with even a fraction of what he usually does. This also happened when I was cooking with him and he begun shouting for no apparent reason at me calling me various bullshit and getting angry at everything i did even standard things like opening a fridge to get something he asked me for.
Recently he begun to shout at me and I started to answer back harder and harsher to him, calling him out for the piece of shit that he is and telling him bout the sheer rage that a constantly bottled up inside of me and how he’s a shit parent, probably fucking me up worse than I already am.
This happened before but every time we talk and try to calm things and discuss our issues he just shouts at me and I take it, instead I walked out the house and walked to the forest for a couple of hours where I tried to calm myself.
This is the event that lead to me feeling nothing but anger for the past couple of days.
I’m scared and have felt nothing but those emotion and I get angry at everything, more than I was before, we talked but he kept on giving me bullshit excuses and paints himself to be the victim saying, stuff like maybe I’m a bad parent and putting on a sad expression for ages and ages no matter how far I push or dig to which he later on just pretends like nothing happened.
I now get angry at everything and have to try so hard not to lash out at every little thing and I’m scared.
I don’t like this, I’ve been angry most of my life but now it won’t stop and I feel a rage that I can’t describe, the only place where I can clear my mind being the forest or my friends.
Again to reiterate, I’ve never been disrespectful or insolent towards anything I’m Good in school and I’m pretty athletic, he is supposedly proud but uses me like a punching ball. 
I’m always angry now and have felt nothing else but anxiety and rage for ages and I’m scared, I would rather die than treat other like he does to me, I don’t want to become like him, no matter the cost.",1
"Im 14 years old and fully aware that this is just a phase and it will blow away eventually.
I dont know how to start this off, ive been here several times but been too scared to post anything.

Ive been angry for a while now, listening to heavy metal, doing drugs, looking at rekt threads on 4chan, all kinds of shit.
Im going to take my time with this post and hopefully not rush it and misspell half the shit.

Lately ive been visualising waking up in the middle of the night, grab a hammer and bash my moms head in til she dies and then start a stream, get a rope ready, blast some music as loudly as it goes and heat up some heroin, i put the rope around my neck and stand on something that isnt stirdy/whatever, inject the heroin and fall, hopefully the dopamine and the noding would keep me from feeling too bad.

But this is on the extreme side of things aka when it gets really bad. 

Alot of stuff has been happening to me lately in my life. Ive been caught many times while/buying  drugs, after this my parents have never been the same.
Recently i punched a teacher in the face because she told me to put my phone down while i was having an argument with my mom via texts.
Ive talked to the cops plenty of times WITH my retarded mom who thinks telling the truth is always the right answer.

My escape has always been playing with people online, listening to music or doing drugs... and lets just say my mom's doctor dosent give her any more oxy's. 

I mostly do opioids as they really feel fucking great and all my worries completely leave me. 
Its harder for me to get say weed or acid than it is for me to get 400mg of tramadol.  (not a hard drug but when you hit the 300/350 level it starts almost being worth it)

I talk to therapists and shit like that all the time but i never trust them, lets face it  therapists do not give a single shit about you, they care about the fat stack of dollars they get every now and then.

I dont think they are therapists, i think they are something else...
I talk to 2 different people every 2 weeks or so in school. 

Most of my anger comes from my mom, shes a tiny fucking 150cm rat, she can do the most normal thing any human being would do and i feel my blood wanting to make a hole in her head
She walks incredebly slow, every time we are in a group and we decide to go somewhere she keeps sitting in the fucking chair for a solid minute more, she smokes like every other rat does
She denys the most obvious shit if she dosent agree with it, for example:  Hey mom, did you know alcohol is a drug? Did you know nicotine is a drug... *she runs over to me*  NO! ALCOHOL IS A POISON, AND NICOTINE IS LEGAL SO IT ISNT A DRUG.
(And im fully aware oxy's are faaaaar worse than cigs, especially for a little kid like me)

Im still considering actually posting this because im sure i wrote something wrong or some shit like that. 
I realised halfway through this that i am going to make a throwaway account, i dont trust you. All of you probally think it would be better if you just called the cops on me or some shit.

Anyway, this might be a giant cry for attention, im not sure...  i think i just need to tell someone for once. Anyway, thank you for reading and i hope the rest of your life is a great time and when it ends it ends painlessly

I dont know what to achive by making this thread.

"I was just in the library. Maybe I’m old school but I feel it’s rude to make a lot of noise in the library.

I was wearing headphones &amp; trying to study. The guy on the other side of the wall was talking on his phone, loud enough that I could hear him over my music. He’s been talking for like the last 2 hours.

I tried to nonverbally ask him to be quiet. Coughing pointedly. Staring with a frown. What a jerk.

... finally I lost my temper &amp; was flipping him the bird with a face-scratch. Nope, still talking. After 15 minutes I left, flipping a second bird when I stood up.

"I've struggled with anger problems for a long time. I've done a lot to try to learn to cope with them. I feel that I have come a long way. I get mad at work a lot, but instead of it letting my blood boil and exploding, I've been working on keeping my cool and internalizing the screaming that wants to come out. At home, I've shared with my s/o my triggers. We've been over them many times actually. Despite that though, she makes no effort in avoiding those triggers and then makes me feel like a peice of shit when I let them get the best of me. Am I wrong in thinking that part of the responsibility lies with her? I can keep my cool anywhere but at home around her anymore. I know I've made progress, but it all goes out the window when she continually presses those buttons she knows are dangerous to press. Guess I'm just looking for advice. I love her and we have a beuatiful child together. I dont want us to break up but we will if things don't change.",1

Background stuff: I’m in 7th grade and this happened like last month. 



I got into a fight with a kid named (let’s call him Jake) Jake.  I fought Jake once already and I won  but the tension between us always lingered even after we became friends again. One day me and him just got into it. We went back and forth and he said he wanted to fight me again. I didn’t think much of it because he’s said that a bunch of times before and I just ignore it. The day went on as usual and when we left he was waiting outside for me. He wanted to fight and I didn’t want to fight him because he does this to everyone. I start to walk off and head home and then he just fucking grabs me from behind and pulls me to the ground. That’s when the kids start to record. Of course everyone starts to record me getting punched in the face on the ground. I managed to get up but he pushed me into a bush right after. I get punched again. I get up again. Now it’s fair. I got up ( still had my book bag and jacket on while he didn’t have anything on) and dodged his attacks. I then proceed to punch him in the face as many Times as possible. He makes a attempt to hit me again but misses and then a teacher saw us and told us to go home. I walked home limping and with a bruised face. At first I thought I did well but it’s just been getting to me. My friends were there watching me get beat up basically. The girl I liked recorded it. My Dad basically blames me for it. This is my fourth fight this school year. I’ve always been the “skinny kid”  and I’m trying my hardest to gain weight so I could do better in fights. 



Today about like 30-45 minutes ago I got on my PS4 and went into a party with my friend’s friends from another school. (Let’s call my friend Jeff and his friends Chris and maya). Chris asked Jeff who I was and said I was the kid fighting Jake. Chris say “ he the little black kid that got beat up by Jake?” Jeff said it wasn’t a fight because he snuck up on me but I cant help feeling mad about it. It’s not fucking fair that I get made fun of by people I don’t even know.  I guess it’s my fault for letting him walk behind me and not being the proper weight to defend myself.",1
"To understand this, you’ll need a bit of context. In vietnam, us students pick our major since middle school and we study in specialized high schools for our chosen major. I am studying for Language major and my desk mate(N) for 6 years is studying for physics. We also get along well with another guy(P) and the 3 of us have been friends since we were children. I and N are the top students of our class while P is only an average. Today was the last day of school and we were learning English and N started talking to me. The teacher(T) said that N was interrupting her lesson and N apologized. Shit should’ve ended there. But NO, T started going BITCH MODE on N FOR NO REASON and told him that the only reason he was good at both English and Physics is because he played with me, an English major student and that he would never get into his desired high school. He cried. I told her to stop and then P and I sat next to him to sympathize with him. AND OMG THIS DEMON OF A TEACHER THOUGHT CRUSHING 1 STUDENT’S WASN’T ENOUGH. She said that me and N would fail at LIFE if we kept on being friends with P and P would suffer when his parents’ company went bankrupt in the future. AND LET ME REMIND YOU THAT THIS WAS IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS. Later that day,P pmed me saying he won’t be taking the entrance high school exam anymore. N is now crying uncontrollably.

"So a lot of the books that I see on amazon about anger seemed to be targeted towards people who direct their anger outwards and explode.

"I forgot what it was about, but I think it was about how she's the one who does everything the most, and or more than everybody else.

&amp;#x200B;

all I  remember is that it started with her slightly raising her voice more and more  as she argued with my friends. then she began screaming at the top of her lungs nonstop, making me very afraid of her as she screamed. I've heard her yell a lot, but not this Loud and it wasn't out of anger. usually just her pure silliness and randomness.

&amp;#x200B;

so my friends kept making it worse, telling her she smelled like poop and stuff and then after many minutes of swearing and screaming and stuff, her voice began to crack more and more until she could no longer talk at a normal voice, which changed her emotion completely and she stopped talking. and my friends STILL kept pestering her, thankfully not for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried helping her and she nearly attacked me thinking I was on of my friends, and I saw the anger in her eyes.

"Hey r/anger
Just need to vent or need someone to talk to to help level me out. 
Basically, I move out of my place the end of this month and I’m stressing a bit. 

Today at work something happened and I couldn’t control my emotions. 
Which resulted in some broken things in the departments I work in. 
But I hate my job (there I said it) It’s been almost 2 years now since I was first given the opportunity. Before that I was a neet. Living comfortably numb. But I can’t stand being a wage slave any longer.

Anyways,
I thought I had it under control for the most part  these past months.
But it’s starting up again. Everything little thing keeps building it up.  I can’t yawn properly Or I gain access to that easy release of dopamine that I’m addicted to.

It’s starting eat me up inside, 
I’ve also been forgetting things a lot lately. (Dunno just thought I’d throw that in there)

On a side note DAE clench their teeth like super hard when they’re angry? I have my entire life. 
(It’s probably the reason my teeth are so fucked up) And it’s not even just when I’m mad. Just anytime I get a adrenaline rush.

I lack direction and not just internally but in the outside world too, I can never find my way around. And I thinks that’s something that stems from my anger issues.

I’ll get in a little bit more detail just for context sake 

Last year was actually really nice. Things were really looking good. I got the best therapist anyone could ask for, I had my first ecstasy trip at a festival. And at 25 I finally got my drivers license. But idk what’s up, but this whole 2019 has just been total ass. And I honestly have no one to blame but my self. 
it’s partly got to do with money. I’ve been kinda 
blowing it on wants, which has sent me in pit of empty funds and debt. 
Sprinkle in a bit of seasonal depression and loneliness and there you have it.

I want the suffering to end. There’s just too much. I want to let people know how much I’m suffering. And sometimes even the way I write I think I expect people to know how I’m feeling.
Cause everyone’s here on reddit is just a 20 something year old depressed male living in the US right? /s

 But I don’t want it to end like this. And I know for a fact it won’t, because I WANT to see what happens in the end. To humanity and the rest of my years.

"I deal with my severe anger bursts by mindlessly scratching my face and arms. It’s humiliating and I’m ashamed of it.

Does anyone know any other ways of regaining control? Or how to calm someone else down who’s angry?",1
"I’ve been making big changes in my life recently; I’m a pretty calm person and when anger releases it’s like a switch, I release it furiously. I’m ashamed of myself for how it happens. 
 
Since making my changes my dreams have been pretty relaxed and welcoming. Except the past 2 nights I’ve had dreams in which I have explosive anger all the time. I’m afraid this may become a norm for life as well as my dreams. 
 
Does anyone else experience rage in dreams?",1
"It's like a fucking 10 ton bag of steel inside of my belly-boddy.

Can't think, can't study, can't concentrate, can't do anything. It's fucking crippling.

Just now i reflected upon my weekend and realised i didn't do anything and i was like im gonna be more productive but then remembered the feeling

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling the tension surroind my legs (i feel anger in different body parts), a huge fucking stone that's on top of my mind that i can't fucking lift. Fucking everything.

"My brother thinks It's the most useless emotion in the world. I dunno how to counter him but I'm pretty sure there are times when being angry is OK and not OK. It's not OK if you get angry and shout with a joking insult. However, i think It's alright to get angry at certain things. Example. There was this A**hole in my grade school. I just ignored many of his insults but one of them, he said ""Your parents made a mistake 14 years ago"" I slapped him because not only he insulted me, HE INSULTED MY PARENTS. Slap because i felt punch was a bit too extreme. I got detention for three days.",1

What should've been a weekend of celebration turned into a weekend of snide remarks and passive aggressive punishment. I'm so tired and just wanted to sleep but everything had to be released so here I am chain-smoking after many years of no tobacco. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I love my wife and she means the world to me, but I am tired of this.",1
"I think I need a lot of help with this. My brother is always annoying me and he always how to get me on my nerves. Hedoesn't have to personally attack me, like insulting me, but, for example, making some noise or something. My parents tell me to ignore him but I can't. He just keeps going until I can't take no more.

 And then I explote. I start shouting, trying to hit him. And I hate it, not because of me hitting him but because I always seem the one ""harmed"" as I always end up punished. This ""count to ten"" stuff doesn't seem to work for me because once I started feeling angry I don't want to stop. Even if I'm separated from him I'm still stupidly angry, screaming and hitting walls for example.

 And then,in the end, I end up crying because of how stupid I am. I hate him ""controlling me"" and not being able to stay calmed. So, how do I gain more ""resistance"" to him annoying me? I'm in general a calmed guy and I don't usually get this angry unless with him. He just knows how to press my buttons until I end up fucking everything for me. So,how do I remain in control and avoid this from happening?

Sorry if there are any mistakes or something doesn't make sense, English isn't my first language and I'm writing this after one of this ""crisis"" in the moment I start crying and feeling like crap.",1

This is not it. All my life I've been rejected by women. I am 25 and never had a gf in my life. All of these adds up so well to ruin my life. I don't know if I should be out there working hard anymore. I don't know if I should be social anymore. I want to have a career where I am stable and able to support my old parents.

"My anger has reason and logic to it. I fully believe this but also know that this is a huge problem for me. I get most angry in situations that are out of my control, like my boss yelling at me for no reason or a driver cornering me on the road between parked cars because I’m too slow for them (I’m a cyclist). I get angry at people who rite for ring wing parties and those who vote against issues that have no affect of their lives, but simply vote against it because they think they are right. I’m a quiet and shy person and almost never react unless I’m drunk. But I’m fuming inside and that stays with me. I can’t get rid of the constant conversation I have with myself. I replay the situation over and over and think of all the ways I would destroy them. I almost want to learn how to fight properly (I’m a small dude and know I’d lose unless I took lessons).

"I'm an eighteen year old artist/college student who's been taking drawing actually seriously since 2016, and for the past three years since then, I've been getting more angry and critical with myself. I've had two artists who I looked up to before essentially spit on me, and no matter how much support I get, no matter how many compliments I receive from other more talented friends or not, I always find myself upset and worse, enraged. Recently, I was working on some artwork to fix some corrections, only to not be happy with how they were coming out and frustrations kept echoing so much that I punched my screen so hard, it's now messed up and will have to be taken into repair. I'm scared to tell my parents for the most part, considering they know my previous records of destroying things when I'm upset with thinking (I've thrown my phone and smashed my PS3 controller), but for now, I'm worried about what to do with my temper. I don't want this to continue, but I also don't want to stop drawing and prove the people who spat on me right. What should I do to calm down? Is there anyone else who's been in a similar situation that can relate and knows how to keep calm?",1
"Me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years. He’s a total wind up and likes to pester everyone around him in a playful manner such as poking and tickling, sometimes i enjoy it, however he doesn’t know when no means no. When i do things to him he gets mad easily but when he doesnt it to me he seems to find it funny to see me angry, possibly because I’m half his height and not very scary. We usually punch and hit each other back and forth in the arm or whatnot (not in an abusive way and rarely ever real punches) and then go straight back to cuddling. Today i had a long nap at his, when i woke up he immediately began teasing and trying to initiate a play fight, i couldnt take it and he wouldnt stop and i threw my phone at the wall for some reason. It’s smashed so badly i can hardly see the screen and it also smashed a mirror. Im getting it fixed for cheap and he wasnt mad but i had a proper panic attack and his family werent angry at all they actually were very sympathetic. Is this a worrying thing? Im really beating myself up about it as im usually a very happy person but i just blacked out in a fit of rage. Has anyone else done this?",1

I have got major anger issues. I’m to the point I physically can’t control myself some days. I can feel it simmering from the depths of my soul but at that point I can’t control it. I need help figuring out how to control it. The dr just put me on Zoloft &amp; Xanax but I almost feel worse with them. Im at my wits end I can’t keep living my life wanting to murder everyone for just being around me. I meditate but in the moment it just doesn’t help.

"19 M here and since I was a kid I always had this anger problem, I used to get angry and break stuff but in anger. But in school I was always the quite and the shy type to kid.Most of my friends told me that they have never seen me get angry at all! (kinda hilarious) I never got angry at school or in public places because I am really shy and don't wanna make a scene. But when I am at home it is a different story,I usually get mad at my little sister over silly things and shout at her but later regret and apologize etc. But over the past year my anger has increased 100%. It is due to the bad life decisions I made about college,social life and other personal stuff and now I am here with no skills for a job, no social life, best friend broke friendship with me, the girl i actually really like doesn't talk to me anymore and insulted me, college dropout and my friends enjoying their teenage years to the fullest. It gets me really mad thinking about but mabye.....just mabye,this is what fate has it for me. Yesterday I was sitting on my PC and outta nowhere I just got really really mad, i clenched my fist and started to shake violently and became red as a beet. My whole day consist of waking up, going to the gym and gaming the entire time and this is going to be a whole year of this lifestyle in June. IK this sounds like a losers life but mabye I am one, I tried to fix it but the damage has already been done. I just want to take control of my anger and not to ruin my life more as it is already fucked up big time. That girl I really liked called me a bloody loser, and I am pretty sure that everyone who knows about me thinks the same thing, It just makes me really mad because I was really nice and respectful to everyone and this is what I get?!?!?! I just need some tips to control",1
"I've been what I can only describe as ""chronically angry"" for as long as I can remember. I have a million reasons why that might be (Aspergers that went undiagnosed until last year, constantly getting yelled at growing up, not learning or being taught a way to manage anger, etc.), but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter, does it?

I've been trying really hard for the last year to get my anger in check. I've been to therapy, I've tried recognizing when I'm angry and walking away. I even tried a little trick where I ask myself ""how long will this make me angry for?"" and literally removing myself from it if it was more than 5 minutes. And for a little while, it works, but then small, tiny things make me blow up. Can't find a scrap of paper I jotted a phone number down on? Angry. Wife not being ready for something despite having hours to do so? Angry. Car behind me slightly closer than they should be? Angry. It's literally everything some days. I constantly feel on edge to the point of self isolation because I'm afraid of just blowing up.

I need to fix this because I'm slowly beginning to realize every good memory I have is tainted with some bit of anger. Very few good memories I have are void of anger at all. I don't want to hit my death bed and think back on every anger tainted happy moment. 

I registered for therapy again, but I'm on a waiting list, and I have no idea how long that will take. If anyone has any good resources to help, I would greatly appreciate it because I'm at the end of my rope here.",1
"I'm in a situation where I can't move out, so I'm forced to listen to my mother's voice 24/7. It's strange that she could say literally anything (ex. talk about the weather) and it will induce some sort of hot, red anger in me. My body gets twitchy and tense, my face distorts in disgust, and I can't look at her. 

Since there's nothing I can do to escape the moment (otherwise she gets offended) and nothing I can say (otherwise it's disrespectful), I resort myself to closing my eyes (or leaving them open if it's in a conversation with her) and delving deep in my imagination. 

WARNING: violent imagery ahead (i.e. smashing things).

In my mind, I picture myself making a fist and smashing the windows, banging the floor, punching the wall, etc. until my knuckles are bleeding and bruised. In real life, my hands are clenching and unclenching, but I slowly let them rest at my sides while I let the imagery take over (because I can't show signs of anger outwardly). Then, in my mind, I grab a hammer or something else heavy and picture myself getting up and smashing things that are the most satisfying to break: windows, glasses, the table, vases, the wall, etc. When that's done, I picture myself ripping my hair tie out, running a hand through my hair until it looks wild, and just sprinting out of the house, sprinting for miles, until I feel my body relax in real life and I feel the anger leave me in the moment.

I've become so good at this that I barely show any symptoms of being angry outside my body, though if it's particularly bad, an eye roll or two when my mother isn't looking really helps. I doubt internalizing my anger like this is healthy in any way, but it helps me cope in the moment.

Does anyone else have a similar coping mechanism?",1
"i generally portray a very calm demeanor and try to suppress irrational thoughts almost every second i am awake. i’m shy and i leave my bed not often and irregularly. lately i’ve been feeling especially empty for awhile and it drives me crazy trying to google things to figure out what is happening to me, it’s awful. i’ve been considering perhaps that i have a lot of pent up anger that i’ve maybe translated into suppressed passive aggressive behavior that’s almost unnoticeable because of my upbringing being very physically/emotionally abusive and it’s most likely because i’m terrified of being just like them(i live at home). it’s come out of me in different forms over the years, lately it’s been mostly sadness, guilt, depression and anxiety. i have no idea what to do with these emotions, i try so hard to be nice but my feelings constantly betray me and make me into this codependent person that i hate and don’t know how to respond to. i know if i don’t do something that i will stay like this but i’m so goddamn depressed and no this is not a joke. how can i get rid of my passive aggressive demeanor or at least lessen it, how do you find your motivation? i’ve pushed everyone away because it’s not their jobs to give me any opportunities.",1

"I was always a bit hot headed since childhood but there was nothing too serious. Although for the last 4 months I am feeling that things are getting out of hand.

I'm mostly angry at people and find the way they treat me unfair. And even when talking about it, I cannot control my anger. All this is a bit too sudden and I don't even know where this came from tbh.

I've tried talking to my girlfriend but now even she is tired of my shit. I know things are getting out of hand now and the college stress dosen't really help. I'm damaging meaningful relationships, throwing away opportunities and giving myself unnecessary problems.

"I came to this sub about a month ago to search for help. I’ve been struggling with anger all my life, it has just cost me my relationship and had cost me many friendships and relationships along the way. I received mostly great answers but honestly I think it’s because of what I discussed in my post: where I was at, what I was trying, and some speculation about the source. I’ll get to the point.

I don’t think this sub is currently working as intended. At least half the posts I read are just rants and venting, while important, I think are ultimately unhelpful in chronic anger issues.

I don’t really have all the answers, but I think that it would be helpful if we relegated these posts to a weekly vent thread or something along those lines. All in all, I think this can be a potentially great resource if we actually work as a community to help each other. I’m sure others must have ideas as well.",1

"So about 4 weeks ago I was having a really bad day and my class was being very disrespectful to a teacher and I decided to step in and try to stop them from causing any more problems as my class has already caused 2 teachers to request a new class to teach in replace of my class. When I spoke up and said ""guys come on, that's enough!"" When I said that they started targeting me knowing I have anger management problems that the school is aware of. They started shouting at me and this started to trigger my anger then this one person in my class who I have had problems in the past started laughing at me and saying ""oh no we're so scared"" I then went into what my friends call ""sycho mode"" which is when I completely loose control and get tunnel vision on whatever made me mad. I then got up out off my chair and flipped desks that were between me and him. My best friend who knows about my anger grabs onto my waist and pulls me back which does not have much affect. I realize I'm in class and I could get into serious trouble if I hurt him so I stop right before I get to him. I then leave the class and my friend follows (and flips off the class on the way out like a boss). I get called down to the principles office and the ass hole is waiting there and I tell my side of the story addmiting to everything I did wrong but he does not admit to disrespecting the teacher and purposely making me angry. I get 2 weeks detention and he gets 2 weeks community service lol.

"Tbh, I really love her. but whenever we play games and she/we end(s) up dying a lot or going on a losing streak, she turns into an absolute beast who would yell a lot, stop joking around and acting all random and stuff and would go completely silent and become hostile towards me whenever I interacted with her, it would stay this way until we actually managed to win or get a string of good luck.

Sometimes, whenever I would wanna quit playing (probably cause I was scared of her) She'd tell me that we weren't finished yet or that I shouldn't play with her if I'm gonna abandon her or call me a traitor or something.

She apologizes for it, but she ends up doing it again after, rarely.

In the meantime a mutual friend started insulting and hurting me whenever I share my feelings, belittling me and also blaming me for everything. Then in February 2018 me and my best friend managed to mend fences. Though he kept triggering me and then got annoyed at me for being triggered. In June last year we had an argument and he decided to ghost me again. And of course the insults and abuse from the mutual friend resumed. Though this time I was not hopeless, I became angry and bitter.

"I have been in quite exactly a constant attempt to get a test date so I can finally get my license. Living in rural New England, every person literally NEEDS a license, it's indispensable. Yet, every opportunity the government has had to delay me, they have taken. I sent in back in early November, because my permit was close to expiration at the end of December. My New Year's gift was not my test date (which are supposed to show up within 2 weeks of sending in, what a joke), but a letter telling me my permit had expired, they waited. I have experienced numerous more issues on this road with regards to government negligence, but that isn't what this is all about. A driver's license is quite honestly the one thing in my life that I need most. I have work, I have money, I have friends, I even have a car for Christ's sake, but the one thing that I need in my life, and have needed for nearly a year now, is as distant as the government's infinite negligence and incompetence. I wake up almost every morning and go to bed every night fuming about how unbelievable this is, and I've taken every suggestion which comes my way as to how I can get in touch with them alternatively.

"Hey everyone, I've never posted here before but I'm struggling more lately with being very irritable and just super angry. If I had to pinpoint any reason for my difficulty in managing my anger Id say it started in my childhood with my dad being abusive and having anger problems himself. I'm in grad school right now and I went 6 days a week last semester with classes, we've been a few weeks out so I'm less busy, but I'm still finding I am so stressed and angry and easily irritated. People I love who I would normally respond well to are now becoming victims of my irritability. They touch me, try to reach out, comfort me, and I just shrug them off. I don't want to be touched, especially not when I'm mad. The worst of it is mornings like this one when I woke up late for work. I work at 7 and set my alarms for 6:15 and 6:25, which I realize is very late but I generally just get up and throw myself together and run out the door... I shower at nights. Anyway this morning I woke up in a super bad mood, and my husband came in at 6:25 to make sure I was awake.. he often sleeps in the living room or stays in another room when he can't sleep if I have work. It aggravates me when I wake up and wish he'd been in bed with me. I wished I could have had more time to lie there with him. So I got up mad and took too long to throw on my clothes in the bathroom. Anyway, I was late because I took too long, and also because I got up 5 minutes later than usual (I'd normally get up at 6:20, I'm only a 10-15min drive to work at most. I didn't get out the door til 6:51, but that was partly cause I spent so much time being mad. I slammed the bathroom door, punched the wall, and that was me controlling myself. I had even used calming techniques (5 senses in this case), and then I got in the car and still just, SCREAMED, as I'll often do when I'm not wanting to go to work or whatever. I will straight up get in the car and scream, sometimes cry, and drive anyway, which is sometimes dangerous. I'm also passively suicidal most of the time but I'm wanting to address the anger right now. I know mistakes happen and I'm often late, but how can I be less angry about it? How can I control my anger so I'm not punching walls and screaming, which makes me miserable in addition to being late? Any advice or ideas are appreciated.

Also, I am trying to see a therapist. It takes time to get into an appointment.. thanks.",1

If I'm ever going to fall in love and try to date some girl, it's not going to be some local girl who does nothing but share generic, unfunny, memes on the internet. That's about 80% of the females in my area. The girl who I bought her soon to be new born made a suggestion that I have lunch with her so I can give her the stuff. I DID NOT WANT TO DO THAT. I just wanted to give her the stuff and that'll be it. I asked our mutual friend where she lives just so I could just drop it off and she just goes ""Cody, leave Maddie alone"" like I'm going to stalk her. It's always been like that.

"Hi,

A professor I had this year (my last year) really always pushed my down.

I'm so angry as the power games with me continued until the final lesson.

Should I confront her in person for her behavior, in email or just let it go?

Thank you.",1
"Oh, just meditate. Did you try watching a silly video? 

These are some of the things i see or hear when I look for ways to vent/deal with my anger, but I think its a load of bs. I don't want to take a deep breath, I don't want to distract myself from a situation that makes me angry, I want to solve it.  I want to lash out. I want to focus my hatred and rage on the thing that wronged me. Anything less than directly dealing with a problem, I feel, isn't an effective anger management teeatment.

Does anyone else feel like this? That the 'accepted' methods of dealing with anger doesn't feel adequate? That the 'appropriate' methods just seeks to distract you in the hopes that you'll hust forget about it?",1

"I hate it when people give me dirty looks, for any reason, even if I'm in their way or something. It's always got me giving the finger and getting in fights but guess what bitches. DON'T LOOK AT ME!!!!! And to people who want me to fix my behavior? Don't look at me either or I'll cut u. I'll never have control of my anger. It's impossible.",1
"I remember when I was a kid my parents would take my Gamecube away because I was screaming and punching things because I got so angry at Melee and Double Dash. That's the earliest I can recall attributing video games with anger.

It's so much worse nowadays. I would break a few controllers/headsets playing MW2 back in the day, but now I actually get so mad I start hurting myself. Like I start slapping myself in the face very hard and punch my thighs and have bruising all over my body. I have old keyboards laying around my room to break in anger to try to redirect the anger to anywhere but me.

Eventually, I couldn't play multiplayer games anymore. I started saying the worst things to teammates like kill yourself, slit your wrists, hope your family dies, etc. and it would keep me up at night sometimes because I felt so bad. Can't even play casual matches in Rainbow without seething rage.

For a while, single player was better for my health because while I did get angry, it was nowhere near as bad. Then for no reason it started getting bad again. I get mad now over fucking bots. What the fuck is wrong with me?

I am not an angry or a even a expressive person, but video games bring out the worst of me for some reason.

I really don't want to have to give video games up, it's all I have in life. Video games were there at my worst and at my best. But I've done so much damage to my body and various objects I just might have to quit.

Any comments or suggestions?",1
"I used to be bullied in school, if anyone even remotely resemble the bully physically or personality wise I would automatically assume that he is picking on me. My face would turn red and I would be consumed with anger.

Maybe they are in a friendly way but my anger doesn’t match the situation. I literally felt like getting up and punching the guy in the middle of class. I have no reason to do so.

The thing with me is though, I won’t get angry every single day, but when I do get angry about once a month, people should stay away from me because plates and furnitures will start flying.

I’m new to this sub, so I still don’t know what to expect from your answers but I’m pretty certain you can help.",1
Do any of you guys get that tight burning feeling in your chest when you get incredibly angry that only goes away when you beat the shit outta  something if so what do you use to calm down i've tried breathing and exercise nothing works for me.,1
" 

I'm pretty bad when it comes to road rage incidents. I get black out angry where my heart starts beating, I get light-headed, and basically lose any type of logic and self-control even if it’s my fault. I think pointing out that sometimes these occurrences are my fault is important because it seems like a lot of people who have road rage are not the aggressor but honestly, I'd say on rare occasions I make dumb decisions while driving or frequently do things that put me in road rage situations (such as speeding up to not let someone else cut in front of me, or slowing down to piss off tailgaters, or chasing down people who get pissed off at me). After the situation is over, my anger doesn't usually subside for *at least* a day, and even thinking about the situation days, months, or years later will reignite my anger to the same degree that it was when it happened. It doesn't help that in some situations, my dad encourages this type of anger and even criticizes me for trying to diffuse a situation to try and prevent him from reacting in a worse way than I would. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I want to learn how to just...let go of the anger and get over it. It gets so bad that I sometimes cannot concentrate on things that are going on in the present. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean at this point I fully expect that my cause of death will be from a road rage incident. Not even joking there, and that's pathetic, but I just lose control of my anger and once I am in that mode, I feel like I need to fully commit to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else been through something similar and have advice you can share so I can stop being the way that I am?",1

Once i calm down my depression takes over. I know what ive said hurts her and i make it worse by falling into a spiral of self hatred.

"It has been like this for years. I fuck up, I get angry at myself, I wanna hurt myself, wanna jump out the window, apologize to the people I hurt and the cycle begins anew. Recently I've been getting better about not hitting myself when I'm so angry that I just want punishment. On the downside that seems to make me go to the next best thing which is staring out the window wondering if it's high enough so I'll actually die or if I'll just become a vegetable. Yesterday I opened it and just leaned over for half an hour. I don't know how long this will go on for. Maybe years. Maybe I'll get over it.",1
"Recently neighbors have been harassing my family for incredibly stupid reasons.  The cowards hide behind red tape and societal norms to perform their actions.  The type of coward that enrages me.  However I don’t just have anger, I get bloodlust.  Every time I hear about another stupid thing these motherfuckers do, I can feel my mental floodgates buckle.  The defenses I’ve put in place can barely hold.  The results if they collapse would be devastating.

For I don’t just get angry, I don’t just get violent, I relish in it.  When those walls collapse killing every single one responsible in the most loud, brutal and painful ways imaginable is as pleasing to me as a summer breeze is to others.  The thought of they’re horrified faces as I laugh maniacally, covered in the blood of their loved ones like a demon straight from hell is enthralling.  Murder, violence and brutality in that state isn’t just a desire, it’s a physical requirement that will not be quenched.  Disturbingly it feels liberating.

I fear that if this continues the floodgates will collapse and the demon I’ve kept caged in for more than a decade will be released, this time in an adult form.  The carnage I could reap and the damage I could take even from weapons would be beyond human perception because I know that I ignore pain and all reason in that state.

"Ever since I was young I had anger issues. I knew it, my family knew it, but my friends and others outside my family (aside from the really close ones) didn’t know. I did my best to keep everything bottled up, as I know how I get when I’m angry, and I’m scared to let that out, and for the most part it has worked. The downside, however, is that because I bottled everything up, people took advantage of me and saw me as inferior. I’ve lived like this since middle school (I’m 21 now) and have grown tired of it, and I’ve been trying to break out of my shell. The problem is that I got into a scuffle today, nothing happened because I held myself back, but I haven’t felt this amount of rage in a very long time, and what infuriated me even more is that the other person continues to insult me by speaking to me in a demeaning tone. Honest to god, I wanted to beat the shit out of him. I approached him and wanted to talk, but he threatened to fight me halfway through the conversation. I’m a rather muscular guy with some experience in martial arts, so there’s no way in hell I’d lose, but I still held myself back. I don’t know what I should do, I’ve never come into contact with such a toxic community in my life (it’s not JUST the person I had a problem with) and I can’t move out of here until January because of college. I’m still pissed off but I was able to let some steam out at the gym, but on god my blood was boiling. I’ve never wanted to hurt someone so bad in my life, and I have no idea why his ego is so big to the point where he’d insult me like that. To him and his group, I have kept my distance, and treated them with respect even with them screwing me over, but I just don’t understand. I can’t fathom why they think they’re invincible. I can’t even fight the guy because I’m fairly certain he’d report me after, I’m in a rut, and I’m so fucking pissed",1

"As an asian female, I have experienced so much disrespect and discrimination growing up starting from my parents to pretty much the entire society. They have a clear preference for boys over girls and girls always have more rules to follow. This has caused a lot of negative experiences that traumatise me till this day, and any form of disrespect towards me causes me to be reminded of my past traumatic experiences and creates so so much anger that takes me quite a while to get rid of. 

Today, during a discussion in class about gender inequality, I was sharing my personal experience about how many adult men I know have to be taught household chores, how to take care of children etc. that most of the time the women just choose to do it themselves instead of having to teach and correct their partners all the time. I was clear about how this was my personal experience and by no means a generalisation, but my male classmate decided to take offence at my “tonality”(???), said how worked up I was, how red my face was (I blush easily and have pale skin) and that I needed to chill, instead of focusing on what I was sharing! 

I was so mad, but just smiled at his response and kept quiet because I knew that was how he expected women to behave and I also didn’t want to cause a scene in class. 

I find his behaviour so disrespectful and that is a major reason why I choose not to share my thoughts most of the time. It also doesn’t help my anger AT ALL which I am still feeling right now. 

What are your thoughts? Am I wrong? Is there a better way to handle this kind of attacks?",1
"First of all, please do not mention separation, it's not what I am trying to do. We have a kid and I would waste all options before thinking about separation and I do love my wife.

My wife is a genuinely good person, generous and has a kind heart. On the flip-side I realised now that she has anger management problems and me being a passive husband (always giving in, saying sorry first etc..) I have my part of responsibility of letting her treat me like a pushover.

I am trying to patch that behaviour of myself and at the same time regain back a happy family balance by reading more about assertive behaviour and applying it.

But let's get to the problem. She had massive family problems lately (brother suing dad, mum on her last breath) which made her even more anxious and she got angry (apeshit angry) over small things (food not cooked in time and she was hungry) 3 days ago and she has been behaving very badly, sleeping in another room, insulting me, saying very hurtful things to me and slamming doors. The affair is so minor that I can't understand how she could get angry three days in a row about that issue. Also her period is late so that might have played a big role in boosting her anger and I think she kind of lost it...

Anyway, the specifics is not important. I would like to know what I should do to diffuse the situation?  She's been holed in a room since yesterday and don't want to see me, have blocked all social media contact...

Because of all her family problem I am not sure if it's the right time to be assertive. I want to diffuse the situation and try to talk when things get back to a normal level.

What can you advise me? (except professional help, we can't afford it !)",1
"I haven't told anyone about this but I have to get it down somewhere as it is eating me up inside.

A number of months ago Rosie was making a lot of noise on the stairs. I was depressed and stressed at the time as something bad had happened in my life and I used to get really worked up inside, but never acted out on it. I was trying to concentrate on something on the computer and she was making this noise and I snapped. I am struggling to remember exactly what I did as it happened in a split second, but I sort of lifted her up with my foot (not hard, I didn't swing my foot) and she went flying down the stairs. She landed on her feet but the side of her body hit a flat surface and she had a small nosebleed :( I immediately recoiled in horror and went to help her but she kept her distance and wanted to go outside where she hid under the hedge. All I kept saying to myself was ""no no no no no"".

After about 10 minutes I got her back inside the house and gave her a lot of tuna. I was absolutely disgusted with myself and still am. I cleaned up the little spots of blood on the floor and she was back to normal soon enough.

Rosie was put to sleep on Tuesday and the memory of this has come back to haunt me. She was put to sleep because of pre-existing conditions (losing weight, being sick nearly every morning and a choking cough... possibly asthma but never diagnosed). I want her back. I want to spoil her and have her here. I stopped my parents from putting her to sleep in March and I wish I had stopped them again on Tuesday.

Sometimes my dad used to brush Rosie and get mad at her when she hissed or wanted to get away. He used to grab her and it seemed like he was spitting with rage. I used to shout at him to stop it. He has issues but I don't know why. I never got mad at Rosie like this. I just snapped this one time.

I only ever hurt Rosie once but it is killing me inside. I want her back so much. I am not well. I am 31 and live with my parents. I have long term social anxiety and depression. I spend almost everyday in the house and Rosie was always there. Now the house feels so empty and I can't come to terms with it (but my family don't seem as affected). I am thinking... more than ever that it is also time for me to end my life. I have mental health problems and suffer from lonliness and now also grief. I would rather Rosie was alive and I was dead. I was crying heavy yesterday and my mum was telling me to move on bit I just can't. I can't cope with change and I can't cope with this loss. We collect her ashes on Tuesday. I am really seriously thinking of joining her, wherever she is.

Ever since the incident Rosie was back to normal (in her own way). I used to stroke her and never thought anything of this again until now. Did she forgive me? Do cats forget things? I wish she was still here. So much.",1

That said, when I DO get genuinely angry, and I’m seething with indignation or resentment, I feel like I’m standing on a beach watching a storm on the ocean a few miles away Thankfully, I haven’t been pushed over the edge since I was very very young, and nothing has progressed past a verbal phase, but I’m still terrified as shit at the idea of what I might do to someone if I get pushed past the breaking point. My dad always said that I handled my anger with dignity and poise, but I’m not convinced that I’m not just fortunate enough to have never been pushed to my limit. The fear comes from the fact that in the only real precedent for such an occurrence I pinned a guy to the wall by his throat and three football players had to pull me off him. That happened in eight grade, and I don’t know what might happen if I lost control of myself all these years later.

"I am 19M here and since childhood I had an anger problem,I used to break my toys in anger and other stuff but I never created a scene in public or in school, I used to be quite kid in school and everybody thought i was calm. Now fast forward years later I am here, dropped out of college with nothing to do and no idea what i wanna do in life. I dropped out back in November 2018 and right now i just play video games all day and focus more on gym. I always wanted a good college life where I would make lifelong friends which I will cherish all the time,hanging out with them etc but ofcourse JUST MY FUCKING LUCK!!!! I took a shitty college and ended up leaving it. I see my friends instagram/ snapchat stories about college life boils my blood!! the jealousy turns into anger and I am pissed off all day because of it. If you ask my friends they would tell you that I was always a calm and cheery kid but on the inside i am very pissed off, i punc walls till my knuckles get swollen etc. Everyday i think what my life would be life if I had gone to a good college and it pisses me off more. This girl I met recently and went on a few dates with was really fun, I opened up to her about my college thing and she was supportive and gave me encouragement to join it again, she is fun and for the first time i really liked someone,but the thing is that she is super ambitious (which i am not) and when I asked her if she wants to date me she said no because she wants to focus more on her ""career"" and ""studies"". I respect her decision but I am pretty sure she would pass up on me with some other guy and thinking about it makes me anxious.

Does anyone know any good anger management workbooks? I tend to do better with step by step work.,1
"Nothing makes me crazier than something that should be a simple easy task ends up becoming a big time consuming ordeal. I can't deal with it. I lose my mind every time.

Example, my expensive Bluetooth headsets worked perfectly every day, but now they don't work, and i had a raging meltdown cursing, screaming, and crying. I'm 36 years old. My mom and my girlfriend tried to calm me down, but i just couldn't get past it until about 90 minutes. 

I've worked on my anger in other aspects, I've been much calmer with my girlfriend, and my mother, I learned to control myself. I also try to stay away from competitive video games, but sometimes I still play them, but if I lose my temper, I'll take a break from the game. 


 Last year I had a scuffle with someone and had to take anger management, i learned a lot from it but I am back to being really angry when my high tech gadgets like my phone or computer stop working or run slowly, or when the wifi stops working or is extremely slow even though I have 400mbps and a nighthawk router, it still gives me problems and is inconsistent and slow. My famous phrase is ""I don't understand""  I'll just say ""I don't understand"" over and over again when I'm spiraling out of control. 

It's pretty embarrassing when my girlfriend sees me having a temper tantrum, especially at my age, but i always lose my patience when an easy task takes longer than it's supposed to. My temper tantrums consist of me crying, screaming, growling. What's really amazing is I can go work in front of kids and be this amazing talent, and then as soon as I'm alone, I go back to being highly combustible. It's mostly when I'm alone is when I have the worst meltdowns.",1

"I was thinking about where to post this, when I realised I'd talked a lot about being angry and pissed off at the situation and thought maybe there's a pattern here. Anyway welcome to my shitty group project, I tried to keep it short so people would actually read it, there was too much bs to list.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

I was in a group project at university, nobody wanted to work with me and the other exchange student and eventually we just got put with a group. We had to make a wildlife documentary, and pick our parts so I said I'd narrate. The group worked exclusively via whatsapp and the local students being on the same major would work together, via whatsapp, sending hundreds of messages while me and the other exchange student were in class. Then the tasks we were supposed to do would be carried out by other members who would note our absence and take it upon themselves to do our work for us.

&amp;#x200B;

I was then threatened with being reported for not contributing if I didn't pick a new role -.- so I chose narration. In the end, I was told that the script would be finalised 3 days before the deadline for me to do the narration - 3 days later, the same guy submit it, with the narration at 11pm before the 9am deadline and they ended up reporting me.

&amp;#x200B;

This ended up being four weeks of stress, hundreds of whatsapp messages per day from people who were ignoring our attempts to help, systematically excluding us, and threatening us. I received an email from the professor asking why I've been reported, and I meant to just send one back saying ""look I did nothing, fail me, the group was dysfunctional, sorry"". But writing and thinking about it resurfaced all the stress and anger I felt towards this shitty group and I ended up ranting about the whole thing, talking about all the dysfunctionalities of the group. I even said that I've not had issues with other projects but both of the ones organised by him ended up being stressful shitshows. He ended up sending one back saying he wasn't deducting my grade, he's aware of the issues and that he's quite upset about how I responded \*facepalm\* 

I realise I shouldn't have alluded to him being incompetent in organising the project. I do stand by the fact that I think he's pretty shit at his job (for a number of reasons, not just this project), but it wasn't really his fault and he was trying to help me. Somehow in my brain I turned this into a conflict between me and him, when I was redirecting anger felt towards my shitty group members to the guy trying to help me. For some reason I just had to send that email outlining all the flaws because I knew if I didn't I'd just keep thinking about it. I feel pretty bad about the whole thing tbh, just wondering if anyone has thoughts or advice.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: One thing that also triggered me was how my friend forced his way into helping (his tactic was to just take someone else's job and do it himself, like what they did), sent pics and stuff to the group showcasing his work, they gave him the OK and still reported him - so I felt the need to vouch for my friend but this still pissed me off. I felt like we'd just been set up and that he was stabbed in the back.",1
"Hey everyone, first time posting here but I don’t know where else to turn to for advice.

So recently, like 3 of my friends and I have gotten in this weird state of them thinking everything is anti-me.

I was under the impression that we’d talk about different combinations of people, but it just ended up with them against me. So after feeling bad about all the horrible things, I tried to change myself for the better. One example they had was that I talk about social politics too often, something I really enjoy, because it divides them. So I stopped talking about it completely. 

But they have gone as far as yelling new people we like that I’m a horrible person, to the point one guy has a literal list of why you shouldn’t be friends with me. They talk to my external new friends I made a few weeks prior that I need to apologize to all of them (my original friend group) so they can apologize because they (my new friends) will realize that I’m a horrible person and I’ll just be alone. Another thing that has realllyyy made me upset is that I was taking about going to a concert in New York with my new friends and this one guy said that I complain about paying for my apartment for next year but goes on a trip. Have in mind that I complained ONCE 6 months ago because I was unsure of how I was pay due to me being on scholarship for being poor.

Sorry for the length, but I have no idea what to do. Right now the one guy is messaging me to accuse me of things right now and I just want to attack him verbally and end the friendship. I do struggle with my anger and it is SO hard to just sit and let this happen.",1
"Nothing's ""wrong"" at work or anything, I just woke up in a bad mood, and I just feel like I'm super angry for no goddamn reason. To the point, I almost want to ""go off on someone"", for no good reason.

I car-pool to and from work, so I'm stuck here until the end of the work day. Any suggestions for just dealing with it?",1
A few minutes ago my uncle made a joke that if I had my own kid I would body slam and this pissed me off. I smacked him around and told him that he needed to respect me and that I was tired of him disrespecting me like that.,1
"I have a real problem controlling my anger when I’m in a situation I don’t know how to deal with. I end up punching myself really hard or hitting my head against the wall really hard.

This morning I came home drunk at 9am and my girlfriend wasn’t happy because is a recurring thing and she never knows where I am. We get into an argument and I lose my shit. I’ve thrown myself against a wall, broke down and started punching myself. Now I have a cut on my head and I’m starting to get a black eye, all because I can’t control my shit. It’s not fair on her and I just can’t stop once I flip. I would never take my anger out on her I would always take it out on myself. 

I don’t know what to do, I’ve never been able to control my temper due to stress and depression and I’m just stuck.",1
"A little over 2 weeks ago I posted about deleting an app off my phone that was causing me to rage. At first, I hesitated because I enjoyed the game but also got extremely mad at it. Since I deleted it, my overall mood has stayed very calm and I haven’t had many problems at all with anger. Even at work (I work in customer service at a restaurant) I don’t get as mad in my head about customers because I’ve come to accept maybe they’re just having a bad day. The screen time on my phone has gone down an average 30% a week since I deleted it, and that has made me happy as well. 

If you’re debating getting rid of an anger-inducing hobby, reconsider how it makes you mad and possibly if you need to find another hobby. If you really enjoy that hobby, then go for it! Just keep in mind how it affects your mood throughout the day. If it’s something like a game on your phone, I promise you won’t regret getting rid of it.",1
"I'm hyper critical of everyone and I have been trying not to be, but so many people are so dumb. 

I had two really close friends, and in the last few years I have been realizing more and more how mean and immature they are.

How do you know when to forgive? 
How do you recognize people that are important not to cut ties with? I just really need some discernment and advice.",1
So I'm usually a pretty easy going patient guy but I have been telling my stepson to do the same thing over and over again..so wen I told him to go get clothes n get in the shower I waited about 10 min before I went upstairs n he was laying in bed yelling out his window so I yelled at him I cussed..I was a lil tickled off..I had to come back up another 5 min later to tell him yet again get downstairs..I was goin on and on bout how it would be much easier to just listen the first time..then he shut the bathroom door and i heard him mocking me and i just fucking lost it i started trying to get the door open yelling at him told him if i ever heard that again i was gonna bust his fucking ass (I've never touched her kids and never will) wen I walked back I  the living room I could see the hurt in my gf eyes and I immediately knew I went too far...so now I'm coolin off in the garage thinking of a way to apologize to her 10 year old boy..,1
"I’m very known for wanting to fight people or punch a wall or even putting actual holes in my wall due to various outbursts of anger. I know this is not healthy but until I’m able to deal with it head on, I need some alternatives to...let out my anger in a physical and violent matter. It may seem counterintuitive but when I get in a fight or punch a wall or something, I get exhausted afterwards and forget I’m angry so I’m a way, it helps. What are some things that can help me get out the physical anger? I know punching bags and pillows are good ones, how about something a little smaller and more practical?",1

"I probably shouldn’t be even thinking of it since i’m too young but I hate my grand auntie, from the bottom of my heart

She exploits my great grandma who took care of me even though she’s so old, she cooks all the meals in the house even though she’ been sick for a long, I don’t know her disease but it’s obvious one of her organs are starting to fail, she took care of me when my mom and dad works in different countries

But her, my goddamn (GA = Grand Auntie) GA is exploiting the person I love most by faking a disease.

Maybe I’m wrong but no disease gives you a reason to take from your mother’s health insurance, she wanted 20k dollars because my great grandma bumped into her by accident, I saw it with my own eyes that GA’s fall was intentional.

There was one incident that she had an attack of some sort, she said she couldn’t breathe and puked all over the floor and when I asked for her help (she went to nursing school but never became a nurse) she FUCKING CLICKED HER TONGUE

Maybe it was an annoyance to her “disease” but that doesn’t give you a reason to click your tongue while your mother that took care of you has a chance of dying on the spot

She did come touched her a little bit and just said “you’re fine” and ignored her, while she was trying her best to say thank you

I want to express all my hate but keep it inside me because i know that my great granny will be filled with despair.

I’m sorry and I know i’m selfish for asking this but what do I do?",1
"I have been diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder with severe anxiety. I have been dealing with this disorder for years.

Unfortunately, I am now out of my meds and the anger demons are crawling around my head and spine. I am not in a position currently to go buy something from a dispensary or caregiver.

"Hi there, I'm a 20yo 4'10"" gal. I've been lucky to have been in a 4 year relationship with my best friend in the whole world and recently we got engaged. 

I have had anxiety my whole life and recently I've really been tackling that and succeeding rather well. (In therapy for over a year now and taking meds, yay!) Though, I have noticed my anger has been really out of control. I always thought it was anxiety irritability, but now I have recently realized that it is MUCH worse than that. 

I feel like my anger at such tiny things is ruining my relationship. I want to be the best person I can, but instead of articulating my concerns in a calm manner like I want to, I explode, lash out, and get so intensely angry. 

I just am embarrassed being such a small gal who I really pride myself in being calm, sweet, and helpful. My anger is absolutely controlling me and tearing a rift in-between me and the love of my life. I have started an anger journal and read through the stickied post and talked with my therapist but I feel like nothing is working. 

I just would like some advice from women or people who feel similar to me because I am so intensely angry, but I do NOT feel like being physical ever. I just want to scream and scream and scream. 

Sorry this has been all over the place but I would love some help, I feel so lost and like a failure",1

"Hi, My name is Brooke 

  Okay first off let me tell you that i have no idea what the fuck is going on in my life and i am currently 16 years of age. I will Split this up into sections so you can get to the point.

Background
Ever since the age of 1 i have been physically and mentally abused by my Schizophrenic Mother and “Father”. My sister who classifies me as “not her family” and “not related whatsoever” is now terrified of what i could do to her. I never knew how to properly talk to anyone or socialize with anything up until hitting age 12 when i was adopted but thats a different section. At age 6 where most of the abuse that i remember happened i was made fun of by my own “parents” and was shown only anger and how i was a absolute utter mistake, ha no wonder people don’t understand why i think bad of myself. Things like being locked in my room and watching my “sis” grow up being treated like a princess infront of me made me sick to my damn stomach. After 5 years of that shit i wanted out and my grandma would make weekly visits to babysit us while mom and dad were out working. While we were being baby sat i told her what went on and soon i was out of that hell hole.

Working On It

Now after a couple of years i am just starting to open up but, at age 12 after leaving that house i started becoming very mean and “menacing”. Every time i get mad i turn into this fucking monster and i grit my teeth, laugh, go fucking insane and tell them to leave me alone. I have suffered from depression like 4 times and i am now just always bored. I have no fucking emotion either besides anger and sadness. I tried to explain this to my damn physc doctor and she called it “teen years” I have showed this kind of behavior since the age of six. At the age of six we had a dog and i developed this kind of mother daughter kinda relationship with this dog. I would imitate her since the other people would terrify me and make fun of me. Even at age ten i would run on all fours like a damn animal and growl when i would get mad, now i grit my teeth, scream, laugh, stare down people, and all sorts of horror movie physco behavior. I have no idea what is wrong. I swear to god that i may have ASPD because i just hate people and get mad for no goddamn reason. 

Ugh

Honestly my therapist has diagnosed me with ADD and ADHD and some Depression but even though i told her about my strange behavior she just blows it off. It makes me fucking angry. Also to the kids in school who i’ve told them to shut up or i’ll place them on skewers ( i never mean that but it sure comes out wrong and crazy sounding) they piss me offf soooo damn much.

So what the fuck is wrong with me. Am i a true american physco, just crazy? My sister is terrified of my horror clown tendencies when i am mad and i am usually okay. By the way i have PTSD and that shits horrid.",1
"Hi. My SO recently left me because of my anger issues. I’m having trouble acknowledging them personally but I know that they exist. 

I find I get most angry when provoked.

I also get explosively angry in arguments. I truly do not want to be this person I am anymore. I’m almost certain I use anger as a defense mechanism. I’m hardly violent, although I suppose you can be violent without being physical.

I know fixing these issues won’t magically bring this person back into my life but I still need to fix them regardless. I can’t afford a therapist and I have underlying anxiety and fear of therapy. (I know, not great.)

Does anyone have some advice of what I can do on a daily basis to work on these things? Or do I really have to be in the moment actively to be able to work on them? 

Thanks for reading.",1
"I've had anger issues for as long as I can remember. I don't like to think about them or really claim I have a problem in front of others, but I know something needs to change.

I can say since starting college I've gotten a better handle on my problem but I've had outbursts I'm not proud of. On the basketball court with friends, playing videogames by myself, having verbal spouts with friends you name it. Pre-college I had a huge problem with anger. Outbursts happened much more often and were worse than they are now. I always blamed being bullied as the reason I got so angry, but time and time again my mom told me that I shouldn't react. Which, at the time, I thought was bullshit. Like why would bullies just stop when I decided not to react? It made no sense to me

I'm jumping all over the place here but the point is that I've dealt with this problem my whole life and I hate having this side of me. I really wanna make a change but I find myself believing it's not a possibility. I can't find the source of why I get so angry in the first place. I get angry at a lot of things so it's hard for me to understand why I react the way I do in those situations.

I've decided that this time I'm gonna get serious and do whatever I need to finally kick this problem to the curve. Does anyone have any advice for identifying the source of their anger and where do you go from there?",1
"Okay, now that I have your attention, I hate it. I hate being angry, and I’m starting to lose friends over my impatience, and have trouble managing my anger in front of them.

I keep wanting to fight my friends about something that I think is true, but they don’t. Every time I talk with friends it just leads me to asking if they want to fight outside or something along those lines.",1
"I was an introvert in school. As a result in situations where someone is doing something and I don't want it that way, I'd hesitate to talk and thus just put up with it. This made me frustrated and angry. I have always been this way, even I overcame some of that hesitation of talking to strangers. As a result I'd fight often with my brother (3 years younger). Probably because unlike other people he was always in sight and would never back down. I had two outbursts of rage that stand out because things got physical.

A few years ago, we had a big fight over something irrelevant minutes later. Everything escalated quickly. I got so angry, I smashed whatever I had in my hand, which turned out to be my first ever smartphone. I've never since bought a smartphone, it was a reminder so I would never do something like this again. I spent two+ years meditating, keeping my mind still and trying to detach from my emotions.

But I forgot. Today, again something so unimportant led to a quick escalation and I hurt him. Smashed him in the head with a floor wiper. He bled. Took him to the doctor later.

But I think I would never get past it, and neither would he. I never had guilt before. Now I do. It's heavy and I cannot live like this. It's heavy because I never would have done had I had time to think, but no my fucking brain had to be impulsive. I feel so guilty, I have been crying for hours.

Will I ever get past this?

"First time posting in this subreddit

I have had my anger issues since I was about 15. They didn’t get me in much trouble then because they weren’t strong enough emotions. A year later they started to get stronger and more physical. I was punching walls, yelling at people, and I hurt a lot of people emotionally because of something I couldn’t control. Another 2 years later I was on track to getting my anger issues under control until a certain PE class. We have a very small school. Our town is only 1000 people. We were playing capture the flag and we had a guy in my class that was mentally challenged. I’ll call him Bob. The teacher didn’t have any flags or towels to use in place so he used those rubber circle things that the younger classes used as spots. You’ll either know what I’m talking about or not. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, they are circles made of rubber that are about a quarter of an inch thick. Bob was on the opposite team as me and he ran across. He wasn’t very fast so I was able to tag him. He had picked up a “flag” first before I tagged him. As soon as I tagged him he started hitting me with the flag. I was hit in the face multiple times and I was reaching my boiling point. After about five seconds of that I lost it. I picked him up as high as I could and slammed him on the ground as hard as I could. I landed a few punches too before I could realize what I was doing and stop. I’m a pretty big guy too so it’s not like he only dropped a few feet. The teacher wasn’t in the gym at the time so it was only students at the time. All the kids in class knew I had severe anger problems but still freaked out on me. A few ran from the gym to get a teacher and the rest were yelling at me and calling me an anger infused monster. The principle came in to take me to the office. When she sat me down she was very mad and was about to scream at me. I started to lose it emotionally and she remembered that I had severe anger issues. She said that the only way for me to not get expelled was to apologize to bob and go to more intensive anger management. All the kids in school were still very mad at me. I lost all my friends and even all the teachers hated me. This was the second half of my junior year. It felt like it lasted years but it was only a few weeks until summer. The next day at school I was called to the office. Bob and his family were sitting in there. Their was also a lawyer. They were suing me and the school for assault. The case against the school dropped because they agreed to punish the PE teacher. Meanwhile, I was left with 6 months of community service, paying medical bills, and 3 weeks of in school suspension. I had to finish my junior year sitting in the office doing homework I didn’t know how to do and taking tests that I almost failed. I figured that everyone would forget it by the time summer came. I was in baseball but had to quit because the coach was bobs uncle. He never played me in games even though I was good. Once senior year came around I thought “they had to have forgotten about it by know”. Boy was I wrong. It was the same thing as junior year. No friends, all the teachers hated me, and the entire town knew about it. Going to a different school was out of the question because I would have to move to a different school district and my family couldn’t afford it. I faked the rest of my senior year up until the second half. I decided I wasn’t going to be treated like shit anymore. I started standing up for myself and eventual a few people forgave me. At this point I still had my anger issues and they were a little bit better, but still dangerous. I made one friend and we’ll call her Rose. She listened to me and forgave me for what happened. I began to realize that when I was around her, my anger just disappeared. I didn’t need some 6 week long anger management class. I needed someone that didn’t make me angry. I graduated with my one friend and was happy about it. I put the entire school behind me and looked ahead to the future. The moral of the story is that if you have anger issues, all you have to do is find that person, place, or activity that gives you happiness. It may just be right in front of you.",1
At my school there’s a rumor that’s going around about me. I’m not for the life of me ever going it say what it is. I can’t take the rumors anymore. (Chill I’m not gonna shoot up the… yknow) I’ve already started think about fighting those who popularized the rumor.

"I am a private person. I like being alone, and I DESPISE being bothered. I am also super impatient. Some days I am calm and serene, but other times I am just... soooo irritable. The worst part is that I get super snappy at my family, and several times the arguments between us have escalated. They aren't angels, but the thing is that, even if the blame might lie at them, or even if nobody is blameless, it would naturally become my fault once I start yelling and losing control, obviously. Being irritable is not an excuse to yell all the time... Even if I am provoked by my sister.

Yes, grown ass men are playing SMASH at work. I've had my full time benefits stripped from me and I can't take personal time off now. I've always been the one to hold my ground and snap back when people test me. I am NO pushover.

"I have sought out professional therapy through my University but I'm still at a loss. All they really did was provide some more of what google already did of relaxation and ""controlling"" anger but I'm looking for a deeper solution than what comes down to ""well just don't be angry"".

The prime target is video games. I'm getting good at just quitting before getting angry, but I want to be happy to just play sometimes. Repeated failure (not necessarily a loss, but usually related) even in solo simple games like dumb mobile games and even Mario can bring me to the point of breaking things. I quit league for this reason and while that was all around a good decision for this reason and more I'd still like to dispel the anger. 

And just so it's clear it's not merely a ""gamer rage"" issue, I'd like to add I have also gotten mad to the point of breaking things over homework. As in, I couldn't figure out this one problem time and time again and broke my calculator or ripped a notebook in half. 

And while never to the point of destruction, I have gotten very angry over... Others' happiness? Namely in what's popular that I don't like; ie fortnite/overwatch is out and seeing everyone talk about it just makes me angry, or seeing everyone getting excited over the latest big movie I'm not a fan of bugs me irrationally.

"I snapped at the only person I'd hate doing it to, my mom. I've always had anger issues ever since I was a kid or maybe it was influential because I do come from a house where both my parents always keep fighting and similar to me, my dad also has anger issues we both react the same way, break whatever is in our sights or punch into a wall. I feel like just screaming out loud hoping it'd help in someway. But it doesn't take long for me to realize what a shitty thing I've done. I yelled pretty badly at my mom and made her cry which is just the worst feeling one can feel. I just don't know how to control these snaps that I have, it's all so sudden I'll be doing fine and something annoys me and the next thing you know I'm punching the wall or kicking the door. I do calm down fast afterwards but still won't be able to face my mom for atleast a day afterwards. It's just the sickest feeling.


Update : thanks for all advice people, I apologised to my mom today and it was a big step as it's the first time I've ever done it when I snapped at her. We had a good talk about me needing to realize that anger is something can cause damage not only to me but to the family. I promised her I'd try my best to control and calm myself.",1

You can be irritated but if you're too tired to do anything with your rage there's not much reason for the anger. Do you think there's a clear connection between energy and anger? 

Do you think anger is energy like a potential energy that builds up in your body? If so what happens to that energy when you think about something else and it goes away?",1
Just to help visualize the scenario imagine your significant other cheated on you with your parents or something and youre beyond livid going around ripping your hair out growling and someone walks in with a big gift basket full of living puppies and kittens. How do you envision that going down?,1
"I feel like my anger comes from stress, and I'm finding this book ""Stress Control"" by Jim White really helpful. So far a big thrust of the top pinned post in this sub is dealt with in this book, but I would say in a better way. It prickles me not at all which is rare for these things; it feel fresh. I am steadily working on the exercises in there, which after reading the first couple little chapters I was eager to get stuck into. And it feels like having a conversation, unloading, rather than some tedious big ask.",1
So I've been breaking things more often and frankly I don't know how to feel about it- I'm just angry right now,1
"First, I come from an abusive home. Outbursts of physical anger (breaking a phone, throwing things, etc) cause panic attacks and verbally expressed anger makes me anxious to the point of being physically sick (throwing up, rapid heartbeat, etc.). 

My SO and I are somewhat new (three months) and I’ve never dated a hothead before. I’m not sure exactly what’s best way to handle this because in the moment I freeze and panic. 

He tries to avoid having arguments in person. He waits until I leave for work or to go to my place to call me and discuss a problem he has. It can very quickly escalate to yelling, cussing, and being nasty (name calling, etc.). 

Yesterday, I pulled a blanket we were sharing closer to me and accidentally tipped over his beer, spiking it all over him. I automatically said “I’m sorry” and he got up, threw his phone and juul across the room and stormed into the laundry room for a towel. I immediately began crying silently, trying to control my breathing, and my heart was racing. He calmed down shortly after but it took me a minute to calm down. When he asked why I was crying, I just told him it was a reaction to him being angry enough to throw his phone and knowing it was my fault even though I didn’t mean to. I said he wasn’t wrong for being mad but that it was slightly excessive. He asked “how would you feel if i just dumped an entire beer on you?” and that was the end of the convo. 

Today, I let him know I was dropping off something at a male coworker’s house after work and that I’d be headed right over. I’ve done this before, called him right after and it wasn’t an issue then. However, today he claims we never had that conversation and that it absolutely isn’t okay with him. He began swearing at me, telling me I’m going to a sketchy dude’s place and that it’s “real classy” behavior and very “girlfriend-like of you” (obviously sarcasm). Although I apologized, explained that I thought it was okay based on our previous convo, and said that it won’t happen again because he was this upset, he still was beyond angry with me and told me I shouldn’t stay at his place tonight as we had planned because he’s too mad to even look at me. 

While I don’t want to drive an hour back to my place after my hour drive here after a long day at work, I also believe that we should discuss this in person tonight rather than wait for him to inevitably call me later. So I’m currently in his apt, waiting for him to get off work to discuss it. 

Am I wrong for staying here? Should I go home?? Should I let him know that I haven’t left his apt before he gets home or just let him find out when he gets here? I don’t know the best way to deal with this and I’ve had an elevated heart rate/upset stomach all day thinking about it. Please help!! Any advice is welcome",1
I’ve been seeing a therapist for a while and I have a lot of anger issues. I lashed out at my sister calling her names like whore and saying some vile things towards her. I was doing good until today. I just want to improve.,1
"I was mad because my finances were confusing. My credit card was at 800 something, I paid 600 into it. Spend almost 200 and went to pay and it was back up to 600 balance! I called and she tried to explain my transactions but I was pissed that the transactions were not shown when I paid my bill. After she tried to explain it to me and it still made no sense, I hung up on her and slammed my fist 3 or 4 times. Now my wrist and pinkie hurt and it's my fault I hurt. 

 I looked for pending transactions before I made my payment too. I was so sure I was right. I still dont know how I possibly fucked up. It's not even a big deal I'm just mad because I dont understand.

 I hate being confused. I got angry and started to cry when I was starting out fallout 76 because it doesnt tell you anything about the game at all. It's my husbands favorite game and all I want to do is understand it and play it with him without having to play all the previous games. 

Therapy on the 3rd. I truly cant wait to find myself. I've always expressed my emotions through yelling and crying. I hate it. I hate my parents for not teaching me as a child how to cope with the simplest things. I hate my grandmother for abusing me and yelling at me my entire life. I hate the health care system and how it's taken until I have decent finances to scrape by to afford therapy so I can stop my destructive behaviors before they damage my family. I just want to feel in control.",1
"I don't get angry enough. and I hate it. I feel like I should be angrier at things that make that I hate. yet I feel no anger inside me. it's so wired that I know that I dislike something but yet feel no anger inside when I think about it. I don't feel normal, I just don't",1
"Punched the wall for a second time in my life, I can barely feel my right hand. I'm pretty sure my middle finger knuckle is broken. It's the second time I've a rage this big. I feel frustrated. Not enough for anybody. I'm an asswhole. I'm a selfish jerk. Not a good catch and definitely not worth it.

I'm a fuck up. Tons of mistakes, never learned from them. Tons of opportunities taken for granted and still fucked up. 

I never get out of this self punishing circle for my mistakes or whatever. I honestly don't know what to do. I've been to a therapist that obviously didn't work, tried a psychiatrist and was just a waste of money. I don't know how to cope with this feeling of insufficiency inside or call it whatever. 

ps: the whole frozen peas on the hand is bullshit.",1
"I’m 14M and i some days feel that every little thing that goes wrong annoys me and makes me want to break something. It ruins my day and my motivation is also gone for the rest of the day.

Do you have any tips to manage this?
The breathing in and out and counting to 10 doesn’t really help me

Edit: Thank you all for the tips, when i feel getting angry again i’m gonna try those tips and hopefully not be angry.",1
"Today I went to a fast food place for lunch. I normally don’t go there anymore but my girlfriend asked since a few days ago we were talking about how we remembered the food fondly. 

I pull up and the restaurant is extremely busy, one of those days where the drive through wraps around and extends into the street and is messing with traffic some. The food is great and it’s lunch so I think nothing of it and hop in line excited. I wait 20 minutes to get up to the kiosk to order and I’m immediately told the Drive-Thru’s credit card processing machine is down and they are only taking cash, and if I only have a card I have to wait to go through the drive-thru line, park, and go inside to order. 

At that point I loose it, I try to ask if I can order there but come inside to pick it up to which I’m told that’s impossible. As I pull forward from the kiosk I try to call the restaurant and see if I can order on the phone and that I’m stuck in the drive-thru and haven’t placed an order. The manager tells me that’s not possible and she’s sorry for the inconvenience.

I hang up, and promptly chuck my phone away from me towards my windshield, as it hits it the windshield begins to look more like a spider web.

I now have to pay $480 out of pocket to get it fixed because I’m so angry and immature that I did something that stupid. 

I wanted to tell you my story to remind everyone here that breaking things when your mad is the most childish thing you can do and in the end you are left mad, angry, sad, and ashamed. I also believe talking about your problems or writing it out can help with closure.",1
"Whenever I’m angry, I feel like I’m not supposed to, like it’s not an emotion I’m supposed to feel. Whenever I’m mad at my father, he makes me feel insanely guilty. When I’m make at my mom she makes me feel like I shouldn’t me angry.(ex. Well you didn’t have to make dinner for the whole family you could’ve just woken me up) And now I feel like I can’t express my anger and don’t know what to do. Just needed to vent.",1
"Yesterday was horrible. I stared off angry at my husband and his family and it just got worse from there. Ended the day with an outburst where I broke things, and it scared my children and I will never forgive myself. I don’t deserve them. I hate myself for what I did. How do I make things better?!",1
"(warning: I should probs look into this more, but figured I'd get the ball rolling here.) 

I feel like I go through NASTY ups and downs, but through the course of about one year to another, as opposed to a few months.",1
I dont think it's broken but it's hard to move 2 of my fingers and I'm still angry so it didnt even help,1
"My anger really started at childhood I’m a twin and I feel like on my dad side of the family it was always favoritism they treat my brother better and still do. I feel like all of this is a build up over life that I’m still holding on from childhood my dad was in and out of jail (leaving my mom two raise to kids by herself)not taking care of his responsibility as a FATHER.  My whole life has been obstacles they just spoils my twin and I hate it now that my dad is out of jail and is staying out and actually working he’s been giving my twin money for his birthday, Christmas, etc you name it. But can’t even cal and tell me happy birthday, merry Christmas or give me money my grandma does the same. She will sit there and talk about me on the phone to my family. I always asked myself what is it that I’m doing wrong. I get mAd over the past and now it’s affecting my relationship I just blow up over little shit I’m now the same when I blow up I turn into a  completely different person I sometimes realize I don’t know how to handle my anger and it’s getting worst I know the person who I’m with now isn’t going to keep putting up with this. I have no one to talk to and just looking for help. Then my boyfriend always calls me hateful when I don’t want to be bothered with the fakeness of my dad side of the family.Maybe a sponsor who would be willing to listen to my problems.",1
"I'm just going to post here because I am just realizing that my anger is ruining my life, and that makes me angry.  It contributed greatly to the collapse of my marriage a year and a half ago and another relationship only recently.  I have outbursts on my kids who are only young boys of 7 and 3.  I'm never violent towards people with my outbursts, especially my children, but I dont want it to creep out sometime and not be able to control it.  I'm angry at the world, I'm angry aty exes,  I'm angry at my parents, and I'm angry at myself.  I am not insured at the moment and cannot afford to seek counseling.  This is my first realization and confession of myself being the problem and not other people.  Ive read some of the techniques and resources here but have yet to start my process of addressing and managing my emotions.  I'm tired of feeling this way.  I'm tired of sabotaging my own happiness.  I hope to find some guidance here to get my life back on track.  If you have read this far, thank you.",1
"I hate loud noises, but they sometimes don’t even have to be loud. It can be a squeaky door, or it could be someone smacking. I not only get annoyed, I get so angry sometimes I want to punch the thing making the noise.",1
I think this is just me but when someone just swaps their attention to me or something I'm doing out of no where I just get a little...grrr,1
Like I would be cool for days and everything would be going well. But then suddenly I would think about some relative and in 2 minutes I am fuming and I have high blood pressure. I dont know how to stop it. Someone please advise me.,1

**Here are pivotal days contributing to my dysfunctional psyche.**

**December 25, 1975:** Dad humiliates my then 14 year old cousin whose pants were apparently too high (“you have to unzip your pants to blow your nose”); cousin cried in another room, nobody defended him; Dad brags and laughs about it monthly ever since.

**December 25, 1976:** Dad slapped Monica full force at 4 years old in front of 20 people, she had asked “is this all the presents I get?”. Apparently, she was the only greedy toddler in world history. Dad has bragged about this one monthly ever since as well.

**October 14, 1985:** We move across the country for Dad’s new job, against the will of all five of us. Eight year old I am saying goodbye to my childhood friend, and Dad announces to everyone that I’m “lazy and out to lunch”.

**May 22, 1986:** Dad humiliates Monica regarding the national anthem at a baseball game. “Anthem” is the word she misspelled at the fifth grade spelling bee in November 1982. “Look, Monica they’re playing the national a-n-t-h-E-m, not U, E!”.

**February 26, 1987:** My maternal grandfather had passed away about 36 hours earlier, and I was humiliated in front of 20 people in my grandma’s living room. Four months earlier as a fourth grader, I had tried cooking an egg in the pan in the microwave, not knowing that cause sparks. Mom brought up the four month old incident, called me “Chef Boyardee” in front of people we hadn’t seen in years. Nobody laughed except for Monica and her facepalming. Mom never humiliated her other three children in front of 20 people, so why me? My grandpa was a bully, and I suspect my mother wasn’t all that upset about his demise.

**May 20, 1987:** Basketball in the driveway against the kid three years older and two feet taller. I drive to the basket and my shot is swatted away like a mosquito at a family picnic. Dad and Monica laugh hysterically, and Monica says “he won’t do that again.” Dad ponders the next five years why I am not aggressive enough on the basketball court. I did make it to the final 24 out of 124 players for the eighth grade team on November 9, 1990. Several classmates remark that I’m a far better player when my father is not in attendance.

**July 27, 1988:** Dad teases 14 year old Rachel about her acne for days, and she finally snaps to shut up about it. He spins her around, throws her up against the bunk bed and her head snaps back; “Did you have hot dogs today? We all know nitrates turn you into a real bitch!” I’m 11 and I’m next if I defend her. “Nobody tell your mother about this.”

**December 6, 1988:** My first organized basketball game. I dribble the ball off my left foot with 30 seconds remaining in a tie game, and we lose by two. Cue Monica lecturing how “humiliating it must be to lose the game for your team.” The radio is off so I know my parents heard this. Self-confidence problems in sports continue for years.

**June 26, 1989:** The girl across the street told 9 year old Phoebe about an awesome museum, which turned out to be a disappointment. Phoebe pouts for hours, Dad slaps her to knock it off as dozens of tourists are walking by. She’s in a better mood 30 minutes later. Dad always wins.

**June 27, 1989:** Phoebe (recently completed fourth grade) humiliated me on vacation by telling everyone that I had asked Julie to dance two months earlier, and was rejected. The truth is, I had chickened out on asking Julie, thanks to severely low self-esteem (wonder why?), not your normal middle school jitters like people thought. Mom and Dad just sat there in the van, and Monica whispered “It’s true isn’t it?”. Not the most mature response for a 17 year old girl.

**August 8, 1990:** Monica is about to go off to college, and has been generally anxious and bitchy all summer. Dad has had enough, puts both his hands around her throat, and shoves her head up against the kitchen cupboard four times at full force. I’m 13 and just stand there or else I’m next. Mom comes home from work, Monica is bawling with a massive headache, “You know your dad has a temper”.

**March 16, 1991:** Dad yelled at Phoebe at 11 years old at the movies because she didn’t want to see that film and wanted to stay home. Forced her to go anyway and the Silent Treatment towards each other prevails for months. Saturday night is ruined, and Dad just HAS to win.

**July 17, 1991:** College freshman Monica shoves my eighth grade feet aside on the cooler in the van on vacation. I do the same in return, and she violently kicks me resulting in purple golf ball on the outside of my left ankle. Mom says we “need to try harder to get along”. I have trouble walking for two weeks, but I’m “milking it”.

**September 14, 1991:** I am grilled with 11 questions about my diet since Friday morning at a Saturday morning overnight cross country meet. What I ate wasn’t good enough, and I told my coach if Dad apologizes, my running career will continue. No apology ever comes, and my last cross country meet is on October 19, 1991. I loved cross country with a passion. We had 87 male runners, and I was 11th best on the team as a freshman, not good enough apparently.

**January 12, 1992:** We all ride five hours to watch Monica compete in her college sport. Phoebe is bawling on Sunday night (picked on in seventh grade), can we PLEASE spend the night and miss school on Monday. Dad says we need to get back, and I said “karma bitch!” regarding the remarks from June 1989 above. Phoebe is screaming at me, and Mom tells me to stop provoking her; no comments about the behavior from almost three years ago, and I tell her so. Mom sighs to just be quiet and let’s go home.

**February 4, 1992:** Phoebe blows up at Dad “so you think I’m faking” being sick; the only person who mentioned faking is Phoebe. This was followed by two months of silent treatment to each other.

**August 18, 1992:** My contact lens rips in half on vacation. I ask from the back of the van if anyone has tissue, solution, anything at all. Nobody answers me, then 20 year old Monica and 13 year old Phoebe snicker. I’m quiet for the next 400 miles all the way home. I just don’t matter.

**April 8, 1993:** I was reaching for a cassette on the floor of my car, took my eyes off the road, and 16 year old me crashed into a brick mailbox, totaling my dad’s ten year old Chevrolet. Phoebe announces this the next day at Monica’s competition. Monica facepalms, everyone stares at me, and I leave the dinner table crying. I had whiplash for a month, and I was charged with an improper lane change. It was removed from my record 365 days later because of no further violations, and my mentor/academic coach wrote the judge a letter of recommendation. It used to be brought up yearly by one of my sadistic relatives, but I put a stop to it in the Nineties. We haven’t discussed it since.

**January 17, 1994:** I accidentally left behind a bag of toiletries in my hotel room for an academic competition. For two hours one way, my dad lectures me on being more careful, etc. because he had business in that same city and I had Martin Luther King Day off from school. I offered to pay the postage to send it home, but he obviously preferred the lecture. Monica was home for Spring Break two months later, and he told her the story, and she facepalmed. I asked why she wasn’t at Daytona Beach with some friends, and then “Oh that’s right, you don’t have any friends”. Mom told me to apologize to Monica, and I refused. The last thing I heard leaving the room was Monica asking “why is he so disrespectful to me?”.

**July 13, 1994:** Monica and Phoebe force feed me twelve pairs of sunglasses to try on while on vacation. Try these, try these, and try these. I walk away, which is followed by “don’t ignore me asshole” in front of a dozen customers. Mom says “they’re talking to you” and Dad says “tough to blame him for ignoring the two of you.” Then I, at the age of 17, bought my own fucking sunglasses without their help later that day. “He’s so stubborn, what an asshole.”

**December 22, 1994:** Julie (1989 crush from above) and I are on our sixth date. She dumps me in my driveway. I’m not heartbroken, and we’re still friends years later. Monica asks me the next day at the dinner table “what were you two doing last night in the driveway for so long?” in front of everybody. So I looked down at my food, and said “I was getting dumped”. So Monica started pointing and laughing at me. My parents pressed for details, I refused, and they never said a word to Monica about her behavior. Monica was 23, and still four years away from her first date.

**June 14, 1995:** I’m at a national academic competition near Monica’s college, so she and Phoebe tag along (just what I was hoping for). I bought a giant bag of candy at the hotel to distribute to teammates, friends, opponents, chaperones, etc. Monica and Phoebe chastise me in front of everyone:** “Asshole”, “Yeah really”, “you were going to eat all of that by yourself”, “yeah right…give it to everybody else”, “sure you were, loser”. Nobody in attendance defended me. I cried recounting the story to my parents when I got home, but they said to let it go.

**August 12, 1995:** Leave for college for freshman year at Family Jock School. Cried myself to sleep because I don’t want to go, but maybe I can solve my awful relationship with Monica. Dad insists that having an off campus apartment and living with her and having no friends is better than fighting with a total stranger and having lots of friends. This is all a charade to pretend we have a great family. My major is chosen for me, and Monica opens an account (VP tells me that she illegally monitors, I refuse to press charges) in my name because she is a bank teller. I have now had no say in my school, my job, my major, my housing, or even my bank. I press on because we’re a “close family”.

**August 15, 1995:** Monica reveals that I am living with her and attending Family Jock School not Ivy League Dream School because Mom and Dad don’t love me; I somehow always knew but I’m upset anyway. This happens right after I’m fully unpacked.

**Fall 1995 through Summer 1997:** Monica found me a job at the family jock school that I never wanted that I struggled with for 2 years; I was yelled at dozens of times by an abusive boss (her friend) right in front of her, she told me “you need to pay attention and do better”. I’ve had trouble leaving abusive relationships my whole life.

**November 3, 1995:** Falsely accused of stealing a radio at awful job above, exonerated, no apology. Suicidal thoughts so I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #1.

**November 23, 1995:** Monica announced at Thanksgiving that I stole a radio. My dad talks to my boss’s boss in person a couple weeks later; boss’s boss says “Monica is such a bitch because that isn’t true” and walks away. I spend the rest of Thanksgiving Weekend in my childhood bedroom, mostly crying. But I was defended in December when my dad picked me up after Finals.

**November 27, 1995:** Suicidal thoughts so I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #2.

**February 1, 1996:** Recent birthday with no acknowledgement, so suicidal thoughts. I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #3.

**August 31, 1996:** Monica insisted that I walk a mile past a football stadium to meet up with the family before the game; I asked to be picked up or to meet AT THE STADIUM and she said “be at the McDonald’s” 16 times in the next 60 seconds and wouldn’t let me talk. Silent Treatment from Monica and snickers from Dad all weekend. “Son, she’s in charge, there’s nothing we can do about it.”

**September 4, 1996:** Suicidal thoughts so I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #4.

**February 3, 1997:** Recent birthday with no acknowledgement, so suicidal thoughts. I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #5.

**November 22, 1997:** Monica meets up with Phoebe and my former coworker, who all acknowledge I am “the family loser” (Phoebe tells the story a few days later). I suspected that was my nickname behind my back, and now I have proof.

**November 30, 1997:** Bawling in my childhood house because of Phoebe’s revelation from abusive colleagues I thought were out of my life. Freshman Phoebe drives me back to the dorm, I’m bawling the entire way.

**December 2, 1997:** Suicidal thoughts. I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #6.

**May 10, 1998:** Monica spends the entire summer trying to break up Phoebe’s relationship with Mike (a guy Monica had known for a long while who never made a move on her); intentionally spread a false rumor that Mike was a child molester for dating someone younger; Mike is 31 and Phoebe is 18. I was there when Monica said that about Mike, and 30 people are horrified at the restaurant because it’s an engagement party (for people I didn’t know, I was just there because Monica said there’d be extra food).

**August 6, 1998:** Stuck in traffic in downtown Chicago on a Friday afternoon because I “have terrible map skills”; said “can I see the map please?” 17 times in the next 25 minutes before Dad asked her to stop; insisted on pulling over at 5:**30 on vacation so that I wouldn’t get to see my girlfriend the next day; Monica said she didn’t feel well but Dad insisted we keep going. Mom is puzzled by Monica’s vague symptoms.

**August 25, 1998:** Phoebe’s boyfriend Mike calls me and says he’s “had enough” because Phoebe just gave him a 15 minute lecture about the “correct” way to cook mac &amp; cheese “skim milk dumbass”; they break up two months later. Monica is over the moon because “I warned Mike that Phoebe is an awful human being”.

**September 4, 1998:** Monica took me five hours to see my girlfriend on Labor Day weekend and intentionally went through downtown to delay me an hour.

**November 1, 1998:** Monica goes on her first date; two months shy of turning 27.

**November 23, 1998:** College girlfriend dumps me, and I’m puzzled beyond belief. I found out later she had been fucking an ex during our entire relationship. Worst Thanksgiving ever.

**November 30, 1998:** Suicidal thoughts. I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #7.

**December 21, 1998:** Ex emails me that she’s sorry and wants to get back together. I show up at her work (where we met) to talk about that, and she calls the police. I produce the email, and the cop tells her to not contact me again.

**December 24, 1998:** I find out about my ex cheating from her ex on America Online. It’s 5am on Christmas Eve so I went to bed. 36 hours later, my dad tells me I’ve been “moping and need to get over it”. Merry Christmas to all.

**February 7, 1999:** Monica took me to a concert as a birthday gift, said that I must be cheap because I thanked her verbally instead of taking her to a concert with a $38 ticket. I make $7 an hour at a new job (non-abusive boss though). Monica’s now husband tells Rachel he was dreading meeting me, so the concert was a setup from the start.

**February 27, 1999:** I was the only one not dating someone; Monica asked me “is your hand tired?” in front of about 20 people (roommates, siblings, parents, friends, etc.).

**May 1, 1999:** College roommate’s ex-girlfriend calls me a loser (due to my depression and social isolation) on my college graduation day in front of about 50 people. Everyone laughs, and I walk across the stage anyway because I’m a pussy. I receive a letter the next week that I still have one more class to go, and I won’t be graduating until August. The dean says I “fell through the cracks”. My relatives to this day think my severe depression that semester was due to my college girlfriend.

**July 17, 1999:** My college ex shows up at Julie’s (girl I dated from 1994 above) wedding (the college ex knew the wedding date and location because Julie got engaged while we were dating). I call the cops, then talk to her anyway while waiting for them. The cops show up, tell her to stay away from me, and I refuse to press charges.

**August 6, 1999:** My actual graduation day, but we head out of town. Phoebe humiliates me on vacation in the car in front of Mom and Dad for having a CD collection not female enough to suit her. Phoebe got mad and told me to “shut up” when I named female CDs that I owned; this one was my fault because why was a 20 year old man on vacation with three such toxic people?

**August 13, 1999:** The entire family is heading to my ex’s place of work; I refuse to go because the cops said not to go. My family doesn’t know this, because I don’t trust any of them. Phoebe says “Oh, GET OVER IT!” in front of all those people and Dad says “Yeah, really son!”. To this day, they still don’t know the truth.

**October 25, 1999:** I come home from my first job out of college, still wearing my necktie; “why don’t you take your tie off?” for the 50th workday in a row; I change into a T-shirt and sweats, still wearing the necktie; Dad tells me I’m disrespectful.

**November 25, 1999:** I refuse to go to a local tourist attraction with the family, and you can understand why. Phoebe calls me “a loser”, Monica calls me “an antisocial asshole”, and nobody defends me. Thanksgiving is my favorite day.

**January 7, 2000:** I walk in on my ex riding her ex on her living room couch. She and I had agreed to be monogamous a week earlier. I had surprised her with flowers and candy on her off day as a nurse. Lock the door, you idiots.

**March 6, 2000:** Girlfriend of a month confesses to me that she cheated on me with her neighbor. I had suspected something earlier, and she said I was crazy.

**December 8, 2000:** Girlfriend of eighth months confesses to me that she cheated on me with her best friend’s ex-boyfriend, but she wants to work things out with me. I tell her to pay the bill, and then I walk out to my car and drive away. If only Dad knew that her parents were born in Taiwan. He’d never speak to me again.

**December 24, 2000:** Monica accuses me of driving all four of my exes to cheat on me. She mentions this during the gift exchange to nobody’s interest but mine.

**March 3, 2001:** Suicide thoughts. Hospital trip #8 via sleeping pills; I woke up in a cold sweat and drove myself to the hospital; I went to rehab where I was surrounded by people who had lost their homes, their marriages, millions of dollars combined. I told the counselor I’ve been scared straight. I haven’t taken sleeping pills since.

**November 5, 2001:** First date with my now wife Janice.

**November 22, 2001:** Monica and Phoebe get in a huge fight at Thanksgiving because they both think the other puts me down too much. Rachel and I haven’t laughed so hard in years. Monica and Phoebe don’t speak until Phoebe is a bridesmaid in Monica’s wedding a year later. On a side note, I think Monica has trouble making friends.

**February 11, 2002:** A lawyer in a different county called me that my identity had been stolen. I was falsely arrested the next day at my financial analyst job for not returning a moving truck that someone had rented in my name. Mom lectured me (“Uh hello???”), after paying the bail of course. The guy was charged with eight counts of forgery, and I successfully sued the moving company for negligence. The checkbook and the signature were too completely different last names. My mom is comfortable bitching at her sister, at my sister Rachel, and at me; nobody else.

**June 12, 2002:** My dad and I get in an argument regarding Janice and I moving 200 miles away for school (my masters and her bachelors). I don’t want him “helping” us move because he takes over instead of helping. Getting my masters is my opportunity to shed the demons of The Family Jock School. Janice and I have pleasant memories of going to school there.

**August 3, 2002:** Dad is bossy and complains we are all moving too slow like I knew he would. I let it go.

**September 20, 2002:** I started shaving my head when I was 25 because I was losing my hair; Monica told me it looked awful. At her bachelorette party (one friend from high school and my now wife), Monica tells my now wife that “Chandler has always hated me”. I let it go.

**October 5, 2002:** “Cheerleaders are a waste of human flesh” very loud from my dad at my graduate school’s football game; dozens of people turn around and glare at him; he rubs it in every 30 minutes all day because we had walked 100 yards, and I had to go back to the apartment to get the tickets.

**November 16, 2002:** Monica is bossy all weekend for her wedding, especially towards me. I let it go.

**September 18, 2003:** Phoebe is in my graduate school city on business. We meet up for dinner, and it is one putdown after another all night. I let it go.

**November 23, 2003:** Dad is doubled over in his recliner laughing at my wife’s family and their backwards logistics for my wife’s birthday party. It involves driving 20 miles past the restaurant to their house and then coming back to get my wife instead of just meeting at the restaurant. It is humiliating, and I let it go.

**December 12, 2003:** I get my masters even though I should have refused to walk across the stage due to so much up above. I get a speeding ticket after my graduation dinner, and Mom announces from the back seat that Dad and I both need to slow down.

**March 5, 2004:** Phoebe humiliates me as I watch my favorite NBA team down at the end of the third quarter. “Do we HAVE to watch this, loser???”, so I change the channel so she’ll shut up. This becomes relevant in a few years.

**August 14, 2004:** Mom humiliates my Dad on vacation with the “proper” way to load batteries into the camera. Nobody else was there.

**August 28, 2004:** I accidentally reveal to Rachel that Mom has breast cancer; everyone knew but bawling Rachel, who “now has evidence” that’s she’s not part of the family. Phoebe is horrified when I accidentally spilled the beans *hands on her face Home Alone style* (“Oh my god oh my god oh my god you dumb fucking loser”). I’m no saint because I shove her out of the computer chair on to the floor, and punch her in the head four times.

**December 24, 2004:** Monica humiliates middle sister Rachel with FIVE suggestions of “I can see up your kilt” (the first four were ignored because Rachel and her Scottish husband like to dress up in kilts for special occasions). Monica pretended to be the victim and sulked when middle sister Rachel (we are very close) snapped at her to shut up about the kilt. Monica was furious when I told her that she should have curtailed the kilt comments because it's Christmas Eve. Phoebe gives dirty looks to me and to Rachel all night. Rachel cries the rest of the gift exchange, and Monica gives me the silent treatment for two years.

**March 6, 2005:** Mom asked me 17 questions about my diet, and I humored her and answered them anyway. “You aren’t drinking enough milk” she says after my doctor said I’m at risk for a second kidney stone. The doctor says I should have cheese occasionally, milk never, and take calcium vitamins. It’s humiliating to be interrogated by someone who’s not a doctor, followed by being chastised for doing what’s best for my health.

**May 7, 2005:** I called Phoebe (I don’t know the fuck why) to tell her Janice and I are engaged. She asks if I called Monica. I changed the subject to not give her the satisfaction. Dick move by Phoebe.

**December 10, 2005:** Dad tells Monica over the phone (while I’m there): “You treat your brother like a child, and he’s tired of it.” Monica gives him the silent treatment for weeks.

**April 22, 2006:** My Wedding day. Dad humiliates my groomsman’s wife regarding my transportation to the wedding. I take her out to dinner a couple weeks later as an apology. Monica, Phoebe, Mom, Dad all make passive aggressive comments all weekend, but nobody responds. Mom told me to make nice with Monica during the Mother/Groom dance, knowing that I wouldn’t make a scene. Dick move by Mom.

**December 23, 2006:** I call Monica to bury the hatchet; through tears she says, “My heart is ALWAYS in the right place”. I laugh and she hangs up.

**November 22, 2007:** Go back to March 5, 2004. The football game is a blowout, so I change the channel. Phoebe abusively says that Rachel’s husband is watching that. I get up and leave, and then I stay away from Phoebe for months. My parents have Christmas without me and Janice.

**March 2, 2008:** Mom and Janice are done shopping, and waiting outside the store. My dad is in the front seat with me. My mom is 5-10, and my wife is 5-6. My dad says “let’s pretend they’re prostitutes….how much for the tall one and how much for the fat one?”. I drive the four of us home in silence, and my parents leave. My mom and my wife both want to know why I’m so quiet. So I tell them, and my wife and my mom both say to let it go.

**May 11, 2008:** Janice and I pay for a Mother’s Day day trip for our mothers. The entire day is Dad criticizing my high school mentor for being a loser (because the mentor tells me not to put up with the abuse); mentor is the closest thing I’ve ever had to a father. Dad criticizes my driving, the restaurant, the tourist attraction itself, the entire day is ruined. He closes the day by saying “Phoebe didn’t do anything wrong at Thanksgiving”. I don’t speak to my Dad until Christmas. I see Phoebe at Christmas, but I don’t apologize.

**October 19, 2008:** My father tells my wife over the phone regarding the March 2nd comments from seven months earlier: “You have to understand, my mother didn’t love me, and I had to pay back her social security debts.”

**January 11, 2009:** Mom sends me a long email that says “you seem too busy for us” somewhere in the middle.

**May 25, 2009:** The last time I have spoken with Monica and Phoebe; no particular reason.

**May 1, 2010:** My mom’s retirement party at Phoebe’s condo. Janice and I do not attend.

**July 28, 2010:** Janice has breast cancer.

**September 17, 2010:** Janice has her lumpectomy, and I insist that I will not argue with anyone at the hospital. Mom and Dad are not there. Rachel wishes her well on Facebook, Monica and Phoebe do not.

**September 22, 2010:** Therapy with a wonderful shrink named Marilyn begins.

**January 29, 2011:** Janice is cancer free, and she has been ever since.

**May 12, 2012:** Janice, Mom, Dad, and I have dinner for Mother’s Day. I hadn’t seen my parents in over two years. Things go well for a few months.

**December 30, 2012:** Mom and Dad come over for Christmas gifts. I remark to my Dad that I’ve never seen him wear jeans before. He remarks that “you’d know that if you weren’t gone for two years”. I don’t know why I let him in the house anyway.

**December 31, 2012:** Janice is pregnant and due on September 2nd, we don’t tell anyone until 16 weeks because it’s high risk. I spend her entire pregnancy asking for advice from every good father I know.

**August 18, 2013:** Our son Jeffrey is born at nine pounds, and he is perfect in every way.

**August 16, 2014:** We have 40 people at Jeffrey’s first birthday party. Dad humiliates me when he announces that “your bald head is ruining all the photos”. It’s hard to regard that as “only teasing”, given his track record.

**February 24, 2015:** My monthly visits to my shrink Marilyn end. The last thing she tells me is “nobody has the right to mistreat you, no matter who they are.”

**December 30, 2017:** I leave the room while Dad tells a story I’ve heard literally 100 times. I’m disrespectful apparently.

**May 14, 2018:** Dad announces the only reason we stopped by for Mother’s Day is it’s on the way home from my in-laws.

**April 19, 2019:** Things are better, we’ve paid off a lot of debt, I start a new job soon, and I’m scared for my future anyway. I haven’t seen my parents in almost a year, and I don’t feel bad about it; neither do they to my knowledge. I’m at a loss for how to proceed.

I know I am some kind of weirdo for remembering these 97 dates, but it's also painful to relive them roughly twice a week. It's so much negativity, so many putdowns, so much emotional abuse, so much sadistic cruelty at my expense. Rachel and Janice are very close, Janice tolerates my relatives, and they tolerate her. I have anxiety about my new job because I have had 27 employers (20 contract, 7 permanent) since graduating in 1999. Depression looks like laziness from a distance. I'm starting to believe in myself for the first time since 1995.

Please help with any advice, suggestions, directions to other subreddits, analysis. I'm trying to figure out if I can continue putting this stuff behind me, or perhaps I deserved it on some level. They would all flip the fuck out if they knew I was posting this.",1
"I know it sounds weird, but my anger literally possesses me. It takes over my body like a drug. I say and do things that go beyond what people mean when they say ""she was mad, she didn't mean it."" I do mean it, when that red haze settles over me. I genuinely want to hurt whoever it is I'm speaking to and I mean it with all my heart.

&amp;nbsp;

 If I try to hold it down and keep myself from flying into a rage, it physically HURTS. like I will cry and have shaking panic attacks if I keep myself from yelling and going nuts. It's like the anger is a monster inside of me and if I don't unleash it on someone else it starts to eat me instead. It doesn't go away either. Even if I wait an hour it will still be there waiting to be let out. Sometimes I even throw up from how it feels. 
But if I do let the anger out on someone, even if they deserved it or I felt justified, when it's over I just feel worthless and shameful, the way someone does when they see how they acted when drunk. And that monster never stays gone. It will just come back another time when it needs to be fed again. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel hopeless, like I will never have control over this and I will never solve anything. Sometimes it feels good to lose my shit. Whenever it's happening, it feels necessary and right, like I need to do it--not only to feel better but to protect myself from emotional vulnerability. Just like a drug. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel completely broken down right now and I just wanted to know if any of that was at all something you guys could understand. I just feel alone with it.",1
"Let's see how negative this community this. I know, I have anger issues and I know I've royally screwed up with my girlfriend. 

I've had anger issues since I was a little kid. I've just always been a quick tempered guy but I've been to doctors, therapists. I've been put in mental hospitals because my mom couldn't handle it.

In highschool I met my girlfriend, Katie. She looked passed my anger, she looked passed everything and only saw me.  

She and have dated for almost 4 years. We live together, usually quite happily. I have a punching bag in the garage I use when I'm angry to blow off some steam. 

I run, I lift weights, I bake, i sew. I do everything they say is supposed to help you calm down. 

I've never hit my girlfriend but I am scared one day my anger will get the best of me, and I hate to say that. 

My rule to myself has always been ""Everything in the house is replaceable, everything except for her.""  

I did grab her arm during a massive fight, I instantly knew that I fucked up, and I hugged her, told her I was sorry. And, she left. 4 days later she came back. 

It's even more of a wakeup call for me. I WANT to get better at managing my anger. I NEED to. Or the love of my life WILL leave. 

Do you guys have any tips, advice, or anything to help me? I do see a therapist and have coping methods but..I feel like they aren't really working",1
I have 5 broken phones but 7 shattered screens in total,1
"I’ve recently been on a roll of self-improvement and my next step was I deleted a game off my phone I devote a lot of time in to and causes me a lot of anger. I don’t have an issue of anger with anything else except that game, and I cannot stand when I lose. In the last couple days, I understood that I never really accepted that it was just a game. Today, I was getting frustrated with the game and decided to delete it once and for all. This also goes along with a personal goal to get off my phone more and spend more time doing things that matter and mean more. I hope someone gets some inspiration from this because it felt like such a relief to delete that game. It may seem like you don’t want to delete it or that you can’t because you’ve put so much work into it, but you can always quit. I wrote down my log in just in case I ever want to go back to it when I’m able to control my emotions more.",1

I cry myself to sleep worrying about what I'm doing to my sister and how this will affect her in the future. I wouldn't blame her if she grows up to hate me and everything about me. I get mad at the smallest things that most would see as nothing. I try so hard not to be angry I love my sister and my family but my anger affects drastically. I have no control over it and it keeps getting worse I have these horrible dreams where I hurt her sometimes just a fist and others to where she is in a hospital and sometimes worse. I need help but my family just pushes it off as teenage anger but in truth, I know it will affect her I remember the small things my brother did to me growing up I can't imagine what will happen to my sister. I want to control it I really do but nothing works. I don't have anyone who listens to me when I need to talk I have thought about working and paying for a therapist but I'm only 16 so it is not that easy. the amount of stress I go through is a lot to me but I know there are people in worse situations.

"Warning, this is going to be a long one. 
Changed names for obvious reasons.

TL;DR, I nearly choked my ex friend to death because of repressed feelings from a long term previous beef that we had in high school that almost pushed me towards suicide. Almost got shot up by a gang because of this. Parents weren’t very proud of me.



It had been almost 3 years since we graduated, and I had been invited to a birthday party from Tina. Tina was my friend from high school, and I had no idea that she invited my ex-best friend, Antwan. 

Antwan and I were best friends from 7th grade to about 10th grade, until I found out he was undermining multiple opportunities that I had (with women, and with other guy friends) , and was sleeping with my then girlfriend, because he was jealous of me for various reasons. It didn’t help that these people were my only group of people that I associated with, and that I was struggling to graduate. He knew this, and continued to pick fights with me, but I couldn’t risk suspension because I didn’t want to risk missing any more assignments. I always knew I wanted to fight him badly, but I always pushed those feelings to the back of my head so that I could focus on graduating, as I already knew that I had a quick temper.

Fast forward 2 years, I had gotten myself together. I’d been working out, I was starting college, and I was playing rugby. I had also cultivated a great group of dedicated friends. I essentially was doing everything right in my life for once, but most importantly, I was making my parents smile because I was doing so good, and that’s when I got invited to this party.

Apparently, Tina had gotten cool with Antwan over the years, and invited him to the party also. I had no idea until he showed up. As soon as he walked in the room, it was almost like a demon walked in with him. The energy shifted dramatically as everyone proceeded to talk and chat with the occasional awkward pauses. While everyone was having a good time, getting high, and drinking, I was trapped in my head, reliving all of the moments that he made me feel like shit, and how he had manipulated my whole graduating class in high school into hating me and almost pushed me towards suicide. I had been mindlessly eating a family-sized bag of Doritos while I was reliving these moments until I finished. And then there was nothing but myself and the shitty situation that I was placed in. The new me that I was trying to be would have just got up and left the party to avoid confrontation, but I had to throw my trash away. Antwan was sitting near the kitchen entryway, where the trash can was. So, there I went. As I was coming back from the kitchen, there he was, sitting there completely vulnerable. Without thinking, I went behind him and put him in a chokehold. He said “get off of me” in a way that meant that he was going to beat me up if I didn’t. So I tightened my grip to about 85% strength, while trying to get out and he was flopping around like a fish trying to get out, and he could not get out. He was barely gasping for air when I snapped out of it and let him go. Everyone was pissed off for (1) blowing their high, and (2), me doing that in general. He left the party in a fit of rage, as I ran after him to apologize. He was obviously angry as hell, but didn’t want to fight me. Instead, I got numerous calls later on, telling me that there’s people coming to get me back for what I did to Antwan. I had no idea that he was tied to people who are in local gangs. I told my parents and family to watch out and I was completely honest about the situation that went down, and how his gang friends may shoot up the house. 

Long story short, it never happened, and I think that they let it go, thanks to Tina persuading him not to do anything. 

When that situation happened, that’s when I noticed that I truly do have anger issues, and that I have a pattern of behavior when things go wrong. Mom and Dad suggested that I go see a therapist.

I can’t forgive myself for what went down that night.",1
I was being berated by my parents over something that happened earlier and as you'd expect I got annoyed. I just stared straight at the tip of a chair while the grilling went on. I noticed that at regular intervals I would twitch a little and my vision would get very blurry. What's going on?,1
"I'm not usually one to get angry quickly, and I have never gotten into nor tried to initiate a physical fight, until today. I've been having a very hard week, and had to go help out with this event for one of the organizations I am in. I'm in college, and I have a lot of work piled up which has been giving me a lot of anxiety. I also didn't get much sleep last night, and ten minutes before the incident I had found out that I probably wouldn't be able to go home this weekend and away from this college I'm at. I hate this college, so when I have the chance I drive two and a half hours to my mom's house. It's a sort of oasis from the stressful life I have on campus. I haven't been home in two weeks (a very long amount of time for me) and I found out I might not be able to go home this weekend. I wanted to cry. So there I was, tired, very anxious, and sad, having to help out with an event I didn't care about. I'm just a member, not an officer of this club, but nonetheless I had to make an announcement asking the people there to not use all of the product because we only have so much, to which someone replied in a sarcastic tone ""that's tough."" I didn't hear it, but one of the other girls told me and I. Snapped. I asked who it was, she described the person, but I wasn't sure who it was. I started to walk over to where she pointed but then stopped because I didn't know for sure who it was. I ended up walking away and not doing anything, but I am sure that the other club members, including the executive board, President, and advisor (a professor for the college I attend) saw me and knew I was about to pick a fight. *I* have no doubts I would have, too. There wasn't a little voice in the back of my head saying not to. No voice of reason. Just pure *anger*. Thinking back on it now it could have gone so much worse had I known for sure who it was that made that comment. It scares the hell out of me the very severe consequences of what could have happened had I gotten into a physical fight. This has never happened before, and I just want to know how to not let shitty remarks like that affect me. I'm also, like the title said, freaking out over what COULD have happened and its consequences, not what did. It's scaring me. I just really need some advice/comfort. Thank you for reading all of this, I know it's really convoluted, but I needed to get it out there.",1
Im trying to calm myself down but im having a hard time every small situation that can be solved so easily and inconvenience that settles down after a while from my family turns into screaming and exaggerated reactions which I hate deeply just a while ago something similar happened and I know it couldve been just a conversation but we ended up screaming again I hate that part so much I wanted to avoid the screams and be rational but its so tiring to always 'understand' I have this daydream that when I get a decent job ill enjoy seeing them suffer in a financial crisis I wont be helping them at all Im glad I hate them,1

This result of this, plus a combination of other factors, is neverending homicidal ideation. I wake up and go to sleep with a mindset that goes well beyond the point of what could be described as mere anger.

"So it’s a long story FYI. So I was never an angry person and to majority of people in my life I’m not. I really only get mad at my mum, my sister and my boyfriend. This anger literally makes me see red, I get these intense strong feelings of I don’t give a fuck. I know there’s only so much anger my boyfriend can take but when I get in those zones it’s like nothing matters except feeling that anger. I feel a lot of my anger comes from my sister. I’m 22 and she is 16. She has borderline personality disorder and so I’m always getting emotionally and verbally abused and mum never stands up for herself and when I stand up for myself my mum says not to because we don’t want to risk the wrath of my sister. Sometimes I get so frustrated I go up to her face and scream right in it til she’s quiet because she is so rude to me. The anger gets so intense that I’ve thought about hitting when I’m in those anger zones out of frustration but obviously never acted on it but that is just an example of how bad this anger could be. It’s horrible not being able to stand up for yourself and being treated like shit. So I think that’s where a lot of my anger comes from (that I’m stuck in a shitty situation). I wouldn’t mind tips for anger management strategies or just conversation with other people who have become increasingly angry. Are there groups you Can attend for anger (similar to AA meetings)?",1
"I hate my co-worker who is rude to me but nice to everyone else. I hate that I let her get me so angry. I hate how weak my personality is and that I stay silent 95% of the day and have no friends or family to talk to. I hate how pathetic my life is.


I am angry about a lot of things right now.",1
So me and my girlfriend will be dating for 3 years come Monday and my anger has started when I was a senior in high school and I was in wrestling and not to brag but I was a pretty good wrestler so I took it very serious and I was really dumb with cutting weight so I would get mad her very easily. I don’t hit her or abuse her I just get very angry and I stay really quiet then explode all at once or become a dick and say really mean things. And just a couple days ago she went to her last prom and she had this weird friend group where it’s her two best friends and three weird guys that she met in choir. Now I don’t like the guys because one of them texted her and asked if they could go on a ride and talk. I asked her if she would stop talking and hanging out with them since I don’t like them. I didn’t say she had to but I asked and she said that it’d be rude and hard but she respects that I don’t but won’t stop hanging out with them because she doesn’t want to hurt their feelings. There’s more I could talk about but thought I’d start with the most recent.,1
"I’ve always had anger issues my whole life, even my parents say when I was a toddler I would always be angry for no reason.


When I was in elementary school things were pretty bad. People used to pick on me and I would force down the urge to start screaming. I could tell many stories from those days but I want to keep this short.


I’m older now but it’s been a struggle. If someone starts yelling at me for something I can feel this build up of anger and then I will say something or do something that I will seriously regret later. I find my self punching walls or breaking some of my stuff when I get angry. It’s like I have to do something to get rid of my anger like hitting something to do it. I find myself yelling at someone when they did absolutely nothing.


I just want help or have someone who struggles with anger issues tell me about their issues.",1
"I have 2 roomates. One of them is great and almost like a sister to me, the other is a problem. She will find something to yell about from the moment she gets home, then she will spend a few hours murmuring obscenities under her breath. I've caught a few of the things shes said and they are either her complaining about my roomate and me (she never actually adresses these problems she seams to have with us) or she is talking about how she going to hurt us for not cleaning to her liking. If I ask her what shes saying she says its nothing. 

Today we were both in the livingroom and she was complaining about the unfairness of a  TV show, not it being unfair toward a certain contestant; just that it was a difficult challenge. (F Bombs are sprinkled liberally through this rant.) I tell her that I have no opinion because its a dumb thing to be mad about. She responds, and I quote, ""I'm allowed to be angry, I like being angry.""

It really scares me to think that she's enjoying it when she yells and swears at us. I don't know how I can live with someone who enjoys that feeling. Especially because my family was really mellow when I was growing up so I don't know how to deal with a furious person.",1
"I'm autistic and I have a tendency to piss people off by saying the wrong thing. I used to believe that this wouldn't happen if I was in a group of other autistic people, but now I'm having the same problem even with other autistics.

I don't feel I can talk about my issues to anyone I know except my parents or random strangers on the Internet, and my parents are getting on my nerves and don't understand my autism or the younger generation very well and some of the responses on here are hit or miss, and the only people willing to listen to the most serious issues without judgement tend to be grooming people for some political agenda.

I have other family members, but they don't seem to be straight with me and I can never judge what sort of reaction they'll have.

I've been told to go to a counselor or a pscyhiatrist for my issues, but I don't really trust them. I don't see why I should trust someone who has the power to claim I'm incompetent or delusional, or someone who is legally obliged to call in the authorities if they think I'm going to harm myself or others - I'd be better off talking to friends or strangers about that stuff, even though they might not give enough of a damn to listen to me or are part of the problem!",1

So, I'll get it out of the way right here: I have anger management issues - I know that, I'm aware of it. I have not dealt with it and all the common sayings like ""turn the other cheek,"" ""offer an olive branch,"" *and especially* ""treat others how you would want to be treated"" are just bullshit, preachy sayings to me that come from someone who doesn't really know what it's like to be shat on all the time, or they only experienced a little bit of negativity in their life that was easily handled.

I'll try to not be overtly long - and I will definitely try to put this in a way that's not ""woe is me!"" whiny or edgy - even though I believe it will come off that way anyway:

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't say my *whole* life, but a good portion of it, directly after my childhood up to this point, has been shit. I flunked out of school in the ninth grade due to immense depression from constant bullying and just giving up with studies due to that. Lived as a shut-in until I turned 18 when I landed a crappy job at a retail store. Of course it's retail so I have to deal with smartass, rude customers and smartass, rude managers and corporate above them not giving a shit being full of privileged folks who managed to get a degree in college and kissed enough ass to make it to where they are, only caring about how much money they're making. I only have one person from my workplace I can confide in and talk to and that's it. She's a 45 year old mother of three and a backup manager while I'm just a 25 year old immature, angry shit so there is kind of a gap when it comes to trying to relate.

&amp;#x200B;

My family on both my mother's and father's side are dysfunctional and I hardly keep in touch with my extended family. I live with my parents where it's only my mother with a job, my father being without a job due to an automobile incident a decade ago. I understand if I am to live with my parents still, that I should help around paying for stuff, but my checks get eaten up all the time that I have no hope of ever getting a vehicle and moving out or going to any trade school or community college.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends list I can count on one hand and only one of them, my coworker, is anywhere near where I live. Everyone else is online and I know people online are human beings too but words can only do so much for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I accidentally did what I tried not to do in talking too long. Okay, when I was young I used to get in constant fist-fights with kids in various schools due to petty, small arguments that didn't warrant the fights to begin with, then I decided ""Ok, no more violence,"" partially due to being tired personally of fighting, and partially due to violence leading to an assault charge once you're not just a kid in school anymore. And that's the thing, I know I'd enact in violence way more often if not for jail time. I also do not believe in forgive and forget or trying to talk things out and believe once I've been what I personally believe attacked or done wrong - I have that person on my shitlist for a good while if not forever, and scheme of ways of getting back at them.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, my manager was being a smartass, sarcastic ass like always, and I decided ""You know what? Fuck this guy,"" and snuck around, went to an area with no cameras around, collected my own piss, found his office door with nobody around and lubed up his closed door's knob with the piss and my snot, as I'm sick at the moment, all over it before leaving work.

&amp;#x200B;

Before that, when I quit the job beforehand, I called to a district manager to inform them that I've been hurt on the job, which was 100% true and accurate, and they demanded a doctor's note *while I was hurt on the job.* So I cursed them out on the phone, hung up, went to the restroom and flushed the store keys down the toilet before leaving the store unattended.

&amp;#x200B;

*Before that,* I was being called a brat by a manager at a job prior because I didn't say ""Hello"" back to him as he was honestly mistreating me, alongside the other managers, so I decided to simply walk out the job, leaving my job unattended.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel guilt about what I did, and I felt like it was rightly deserved of each and every one of them. Trust me, I understand if I have not been living with my parents and was actually on my own, I would be *fucked.* I just feel the urge, the need to let out how I feel about every cunt and trying to keep it in is too much, I can't talk it out to them because I seriously doubt they care and I don't care to want to even try to be diplomatic with people being shitty to me, and I have no one to really talk to and when I do, it's the standard advice that I expect and I just nod along and go ""Yeah, okay, you're right."" *But the anger is still there. I want to give people their comeuppance.* I'd feel better if I could knock them out with a punch, sometimes I envision killing them and that makes me feel so good.

"Hello all, I am an 18 years old and this whole anger problem is new thing to me. I just recently stopped taking my anxiety medication and a huge side effect after stopping is anger and irritability. Literally everything makes me upset. Its destroying me and my relationship. I cannot handle little things like dropping something without becoming furious. Whenever my boyfriend tries to have a calm discussion with me it's like a beast takes over, and I don't remember half of the things I say or do. We have been together 2 and a half years and I say things to him he doesn't deserve in a lifetime. It's terrifying and I hate hurting the people around me. I want to be better. Any recommendations?

"So first of all let me start by saying I’d never hurt anyone. Seriously i think it’s wrong. In my 30 years of life I can say I’ve never physically hurt anyone. 

Now for the main issue. Recently my wife’s been going through a rough time and might get let go from her job. Well when I hear this I get mad and say how I’ll fucking kill her dick boss. I say pretty violent and angry things and in a way it’s like a release for me. Problem is she hates it and tells me to “grow up.” While I want to stop, in a way saying those kind of things is a release, especially since I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I know it isn’t healthy to say things like that. 

It also doesn’t help that I was bullied and sadly to get it to stop I’d threaten kids. And it wasn’t like I was over sensitive. I got called fag, queer, fudgepacker, cocksucker. However I could be an asshole to. I even falsely accused a kid of mooning me because he was a porn freak and asshole. 

Anyways how do I stop these thoughts? It’s tough because in away it’s my way of venting and I also feel like my wife and I are trapped in a shit situation where we are working low wage jobs and living off of food stamps. It really stresses me out. I know I’m just worried and it comes out as anger but I feel nothing else will help and when I get angry I also get in a fuck it kind of mood.",1
"Has anyone experienced physical pain traceable to repressed anger? 

I have experienced a “mystery” intermittent back pain for years. Like a muscle ache that is hard to pinpoint, but also like indigestion. It only happens every few weeks, for a day, and is gone the next morning.

I’ve sought medical treatment recently, and my doctors have about ruled out anything physically wrong with me. So it seems increasingly plausible there is a psychological origin. I keep detailed records of my pain episodes and suspect I know which triggers may be responsible.

If so, obviously I should seek to avoid my triggers and manage my reaction to them, but in the meantime, can I do anything for the pain? Over the counter medications, ice, heat, or stretching are all pretty ineffective. I’m wondering if anyone has been treated for a similar issue and how you resolved it.",1

However i missed some asgments last week so she noticed them today and started telling me that if dont act now im going to be a failiure for the rest of my life and that I was gping nowhere. I took it for personal level and just fucking snapped at her, told her how she was a bitch when she got hit by a depression wave, told her that her high school diploma from my country is useless, and told her how fucking bad she struggles with English.

My dad passed away about 4 months ago and in the last month-and-a-half I found it very difficult to deal with my anger again, it's always over the little things and it's starting to affect my work environment and my friendships.

"Hi, so I’m not going to try to convince anyone that I’m a good or bad person, frankly, I think it petty to concern myself with others view on how moral I am with. I only care about not harming others the best I can. Anyway, so ya, I hate her. 
Besides how I am to my gf, I’m generally cold hearted inside, not outside, inside. To me my dog is mostly an annoyance. She is supremely stubborn, she wines to go outside but runs away when we try to take her outside. Idk why. It’s like she’s lazy or fears we will leave her out or something even tho we never did that. For whatever reason it’s a chore forcing her outside to pee and poop, I have to force her every inch of the way. I’ve tried gentle and friendly, stern but kind, and yes I have gotten angry and just pulled her by the collar. Nothing makes it easy, so now I just brush my fingers on her collar all the way to the door, to the porch, to the end of the porch, then out to the grass. Often she will try to come back in without peeing and I nudge her  back until she does. And before you think my anger was the reason for her weird behavior, no, weird behavior came first, anger came after. Not only this, but I have to do the same drill for pee then poop, and it’s not that rare that after multiple attempts at making her go outside, giving her ATLEAST one opportunity for it, she dumps inside. She also just smells and wines a lot lol. My gf takes her for walks here and there and so does my mom sometimes, but we are too busy keep her truly happy(personally I don’t think dogs should be without other dogs). So what’s the problem? Well it’s like I said I’m a cold motherfucker kinda, and I’ve has dreams of stabbing her but her skin is rock hard and I can’t, and I don’t mistreat her really but she can tell I’m furious with her. I get overly angry at her and it makes me very tense and I’m convinced I have made her behavior way worse because of that; so I didn’t cause her behavior but worsened it. I just don’t want to scare her anymore, or make her feel hated. I feel sorry for her because my gf is nice to her but doesn’t give her much affection, my mother is very affectionate and is her only true love I think but she works all the time, and then there’s me, your hateful bastard who can’t seem to give her love. Sometimes I think I’m incapable of love for an animal idk. Maybe that shouldn’t be my goal; my main goal is to not be angry with her cuz I know she can feel it and I don’t think she feels secure. I can be so angry I envision myself cutting her in half or leaving her outside for the alligators. It’s not good. I don’t hit her or anything, I can control my actions I guess, but I think she can sense my hate. I just want her to not have to be  in a negative environment anymore, but don’t know how to just chill the fuck out.",1
"Everything I’m about to say is something I’ve discussed with this ass. I’m just tired and I want him out of my house.

The thing that got me was that he talked about his living with us was the first time he’s been independent.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember the feeling of uncontainable rage when my dad beat me as a child. Always with the wooden duster handle that hung next to the TV. 

I was trapped in a tiny body, afraid to do or say anything wrong for fear of getting my ass beat again. I held it in. I can’t tell you how many times I felt that rage growing up. It felt like every day. 

I don’t remember crying much as a kid, but when I did, it was because my body couldn’t contain the anger that boiled inside me. Hatred streamed from my eyes. It was the type of anger that came with knowing that I had no control over my life. 

**After getting beat**, I’d be sent to the kitchen to kneel on the air conditioning vents for a few hours to think about what I had done. Sometimes it was for fighting with my brother. Other times it was for not doing my homework. 

The time I spent kneeling on those vents didn’t do much to calm my rage. I felt trapped. I didn’t know how to reconcile my emotions. I was never taught how. How could I be taught something that my parents didn’t know? 

Anger comes from the fear you feel inside - fear of looking weak, fear of not being loved, fear of being rejected. But it takes shape in the outer world in the form violence. It’s a defense mechanism. There’s power that comes with it. Anger inspires confidence within oneself. 

**I think that’s why I’ve been an angry person for so long**. I saw how my dad’s anger made me feel as a boy. I was intimidated, helpless. So I turned around used it as a tool to manipulate others, to make them feel intimidated and helpless. 

As I grew up, I used anger to intimidate people. If they hit me, metaphorically or literally, I hit back. And I always tried to hit twice as hard. 

And the thing is, it worked. *Anger worked*. 

As I grew up, I continued to use anger to my advantage. I used road rage to inject fear in strangers. I used threats to manipulate actions. I went at people’s throats if I didn’t agree with their actions. Confrontation was a dear friend. 

**It was only a few years ago that I realized that my anger stopped working**. Or maybe it never really worked before. Maybe I just thought that it worked. Instead of being in control of my life, I was lost. I started seeing the hurt in people’s eyes when I said hurtful things. I started pushing people away. People that I loved. 

First, it was my friends. Then it was my ex. Finally, it was my girlfriend.

My tolerance for verbal abuse and violence is high. It had to be when I was growing up. I didn’t realize that other families weren’t like mine, and thus other people didn’t have the same beliefs I had. 

I went to see a therapist when my ex-girlfriend left me four years ago. I was in shock when she left. I didn’t think she would ever leave. She still loved me. She didn’t want to leave. I knew this and had taken advantage of it. But regardless of how much she loved me, she had to. For herself.

**That was the first time I looked in the metaphorical mirror and saw who I was.** An angry, manipulative, controlling person. I finally understood. I had to change. 

**The first step was to learn how to stop**. Pause. I was used to reacting without thinking. I *embodied* my emotions - what I felt, I did. Instead I had to learn to recognize early signs of anger. Then stop. If I could do that, I could do the next step.

It took me months to be able to stop, to pause. But I was far from perfect. There were moments when I would see myself becoming angry, notice that I was angry and pause, but let myself argue anyway. Whether I was right or wrong. 

In those moments of pause, I watched myself and saw how I was arguing from my ego. I saw how I was arguing because I was scared of being wrong. I was arguing because I wanted to feel in control.

These observations helped me face the reality of who I was. A person who was so tense and tight with anger that I would have to stretch to loosen up. I had to learn that there was another way to live. A way without anger. 

**The second step was to hold myself accountable for my anger.** I still didn’t think it was possible to control my anger, but the least I could do was take responsibility for it. 

Whenever I let myself get angry, I would come back and apologize. Apologize for letting myself get out of control. It was embarrassing. I felt weak. And stupid. But I had to use whatever psychological tools I knew of. Negative reinforcement was one way. 

**The third step was to sit with my anger.** This last step was when I really got to know my anger. I got know how it felt when it moved through my body. I got to know the thoughts my brain had when I was angry. And it was uncomfortable as fuck. 

When I felt angry, I stopped. When I stopped, I could now force myself to not say or do anything impulsively. It was only after this that I could sit with the feeling of anger.

As I did, I noticed how it swept through my body. I watched my body when I got angry. I noticed my fists clench. My jaws tighten. My heart race. My ears hot. I noticed how I blamed and deferred. 

I just watched. Felt. Listened. Let the anger move through me. Screaming for me to let it out. I told myself that it was okay to be angry. That other people’s aggression could be returned with love. I spoke to my inner child. I didn’t ignore the it. I addressed it. And within minutes, I saw that my anger would slowly fade away. Just by sitting there.

My problem was that I didn’t just feel emotions. I *was* the emotion. I embodied anger with my furrowed eyebrows, clenched fists, loud voice. Now, instead of a knee-jerk reaction, I started talking to my body. 

*What are you currently feeling?*

*What triggered the anger?*

*Why are you angry?*

*Why do you think is the real reason you got angry?* 

*What are you scared of?*

**This is the final step.** I had learned how to stop my impulsive reactions. I had learn how to watch my body when it got angry. Now I could finally have a conversation with it. I could now dive into *why I was angry.* What insecurities? What fears? What trauma?

Anger has become a signal for me. It tells me that there’s something that needs to be addressed. Something I need to deal with. A fear of loss. A fear of being out of control. A fear of change.

When I started this journey, I knew that other people weren’t angry like me. And if they were different, I could be different too. I could get to know myself better. I could start to untangle the knots that protected my fragile ego. And I could finally become me.",1

"I feel like I’m a serial killer waiting to happen and it disturbs the hell out of me.

I can’t stop my brain from conjuring these extremely vivid depictions if how I’m going to attack and severely injure, maim, torture or murder the people in my life I feel have unfairly rejected me or who aren’t ‘on my side’.

This has been going on for a while bit recently in the past 4 months or so I’ve taken to self-harming to interrupt the intrusive thoughts by biting into my arm as hard as possible. I used to just shout and scream but now I don’t do that instead I just ‘erupt’ into this fucked up reaction. I haven’t broken my skin yet but there are bruises where I’ve bitten myself. Not good, and obviously fucking weird.

I have a therapist and they’ve suggested wearing an elastic band and snapping it against my wrist to interrupt my intrusive thoughts but it hasn’t helped. The intense murder opus thoughts bubble up SO FAST that I don’t have the time or focus to do anything practical about stopping/calming down. It’s almost like when your hand automatically flinches from a hot stove, it’s so fast. 

Has anyone else gone through this? How do you stop your brain hijacking your mind/focus into deeply problematic violent revenge fantasies?",1
"I fixate on it and if I let go, it feels like I will damage my self-respect. I can’t let it go and it drains my energy, almost stopping me from focusing on my daily activities. Extremely angry especially when it is about someone whom I can’t express feelings as they are toxic. I don’t want to forget about what they did but this also makes me feel bad and sad. It is like a vicious cycle.",1
"I'm 33 and have problems controlling my anger when I'm alone and things go to shit.

Last night a few of my pigs got out of their pen and wouldn't go back in. I was in a fight of rage yelling and screaming ended up punching the a wall land breaking my hand.

I have gotten some medication for my anger issues but I stopped taking them for a little while I guess I need to be better about taking them.",1
"So when someone that I am close with be it family or friends does something like change plans unexpectedly at the last minute I go full rage mode. I need some helpful advice on how to stop myself from letting my anger out at the people who I am closest to as it is really affecting my relationships with those people.

Thanks",1

"I look for fights sometimes just to get some attention. I know it is stupid and it won't help in the long term, but I've tried to find friends for so long and no one wants me anyways, so this is the only way I can get attention. It's always also the ones that I know over the internet which are my only social contacts on most days and I don't wanna loose them, but they have to put up with it so frequently, I don't know anymore, I genuinely consider suicide",1
"that piece of shit.

we are working a project that has had to be restarted multiple times, mostly due to him, but atmittedly sometimes due to us.
so today he tells us that we have to come in and complete it over the weekend.

fuck that piece of shit.
i still dont know if im just gonna lie down and take it or if i am going to not show up and probably be fired.
im too angry to make a decision right now.",1
"I have major Anger issues. In my worst moments, I have hit people, punched walls, thrown things to the floor, screamed violently, always could find passive aggressive ways to 'get back at people'. But what came after these moments were hellish, the guilt, the shame of acting like a mad person, the regret of loosing the battle just for loosing my temper

I wanted to improve myself and I have done some growing up on my part. Also, since the past decade (I am 30 yrs old) I have been practicing being mindful and it has helped a great deal.

I can read the physical signs in my body when the Hulk is trying to take over. It sort of feels like my whole body is vibrating, like a dragon that is breathing in before it opens it's mouth and pours out fire. I am able to catch myself when it happens and try to remind myself to loosen my shoulders, unclench my jaw/fist, straighten those angry eyebrows and lips and make an effort to listen to the other person.

What should be the next step? How do I get to place where I am actively getting a resolution to the issue at hand. I would give you an example - My husband and I share all household responsibilities. We have designated duties (he pays the rent on time, I pay the bills on time) but we also take turns (for cooking, walking the dog). Also want to mention that we are both working full time jobs. Gender equality personified isn't it? But lately he is giving me the vibe that I should be grateful that he considers me his equal (is oxymoron the correct word for this?). At one point he said ""people (like him) who font force others (that would be me) to do something ( cooking), who care about other people, start getting taken for granted. And I swear the dragon was breathing in HARD. I almost felt dizzy but I caught it and calmed myself down.

I tried to ask  questions to make sure I was not misinterpreting  but his face and silence were telling me he did mean what he said and I could also see the conflict on his face. I decided that it is not worth digging any deeper, it is only going to get uglier. But I did not know what to do in that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I am afraid if I do not get to the next step, all this will lead to resentment build up and that's a dragon I don't want to face. HELP!!",1
"My whole life has been filled with anger and confusion. Ever since I was like 5 years old I've always been extremely pissed off with myself. I feel like everytime I try to do something I don't think of what I'm doing and I end up screwing everything and people get mad at me, so I get confused and then I get really pissed off after I just realized what I have done. I also feel like everytime I try to get a point across, I sound like a fucking retard and it ends up with so much miscommunication. It's complete ass please help lmao.",1
"I am 38 and pretty even tempered except around my period and when things start spinning off into the deep end.  I cant remember a time when i have handled stress and anxiety calmly and think it is the cause for my many break ups and loss of friendships, mostly at my decision. I have tried and am still trying everything in my power but the ugly monster still lurks in my body waiting to get out and go crazy. Has anyone been medicated for such anger and could you please let me know how you feel about this medication?",1

Do you remember the first time you felt rage? Did you feel it when you were young, or did it develop over time? What sort of things triggered it for you? For me it was authority figures and anyone who treated me like a little kid (even though I was).

An example of this would be me lashing out my girlfriend. I was in a really bad mood that day all ready and she said that a poster I showed her looked fake and wasn't real. For some reason this just set me off and I got angry at her. It seems at if the smallest dumbest things trigger me and I don't know how to handle it.

I’m 30 years old and I’ve been dealing with envy and rage issues since I was 13. The other day I expressed how I wanted to lash out at this one twitch streamer on a discord server and I got banned from it and the discord servers admin banned me on her twitch and this morning I lashed out at my uncle because I woke up and thought of a cousin that stole my job from me and how it was unfair I want to attack her. I’ve also had these feelings towards some random girl that gets voice acting gigs living California while I’m left to rot in this hick town.

"I’m feeling anxious, angry, depressed, stressed all of a sudden this week and I have no idea why. My behavior is normally optimistic and positive, but recently I’m getting offended easily, irritated easily and my anger is hair trigger. I don’t yell or explode on people but I handle it privately by exploding on things that are mine (throwing shit when no one is around crushing styrofoam cups are just 2 examples of how it’s happened) and I’m always thinking about it constantly, I really just want to break my phone in half, which sounds stupid but as I’m writing this I’m going through my thoughts and getting mad. The worst part is that the feedback loop repeats the cycle of all of these negative emotions and I don’t know how to handle it. I hate who I am feeling angry like this for no reason.",1
"I'm writing to see if anyone has had the same thing. The last week or two I've been incredibly on edge for no apparent reason. I'll feel calm and then suddenly a small thing like not having a spot to sit on the public transport or a small thing at work going wrong will set me off and I suddenly feel like I'm about to explode and have to stop the urge to completely destroy something.

Once I'm able to calm down I feel like a completely different person and like the anger doesn't even belong to me, like I don't know that person who was about to put his fist through a computer screen. What I don't get is how suddenly it's seemed to pop up.

I used to get really angry as a kid about specific small things and punched a couple holes in walls, but this feels much more unbridled and like it could get dangerous if I don't find a better way to be present and ok with some of the things going on.

I'm going to try and see a therapist to talk about some things, but live in an area where I think their main patients are homeless people, drug addicts, and schizophrenics, so have a feeling they might just tell me to grow up and deal with it and get real problems if I want to see them.

"I am a college student and dealing with a high-stress academic environment out of state ... a couple of weeks ago, I was on the phone with my dad. He has been dealing with much bigger challenges at his job than I am dealing with at school, and since I have just been ranting to him for the past two semesters almost non-stop (and he has told me repeatedly that he wants to be there for me but it is hard with his work responsibilities), yesterday he lost it and basically told me I need to just stop complaining about all my problems, that I have the rest of my life in front of me and I'm worrying myself to death over a single semester's or a single year's worth of grades ... I didn't get this message immediately and it took a couple of days before he made this clear to me. In the meantime, I smashed a plastic hanger against my door, threw my bunk bed ladder across the room, and slammed a drawer so hard it broke ... in the past, hangers have been enough to calm me down but even that was unhealthy ... this is just ridiculous. I scared my roommate's girlfriend while she was in his bedroom and after I came crying to his room for a hug, I could tell she was afraid of what I had just done. I feel horrible about it and I avoided my roommate for the couple of weeks since that happened, and only just now told him about how I was feeling and everything that happened. I feel so guilty. My roommate is one of my few friends at this university and I need to find ways of dealing with my anger against other people and situations that I can't control in a healthy way VERY soon (right now). Does anyone have anything I can start doing now, besides starting to see a psychologist or counselor regularly (I've gotten this recommendation before but I have never considered it seriously until now).",1
"I hear a lot on this sub how many don't know how to deal with anger, so I wanted to share with everyone something I found useful.

This one song found me serendipitously when a stranger played it walking by. It swayed me deeply and then wrecked me emotionally with abandon. I tried to shazam the song but's name wouldn't show. I ended up catching up with the stranger to ask her its name. Since then I have found it, and many other songs, painfully therapeutic to sing. Music has since brought down my walls of anger and released the flood of sadness I was holding in. I am free.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could sing this song with my little brother Philip, who died by suicide last month when he was only 28. For all of you struggling out there, I hope you can find a song that helps you release your anger positively. It doesn't have to be anything religious, just find yourself a song that connects. If this song is for you, I encourage you to look it up and sing along. I hope it helps. Peace be with you.

"Yesterday my mother sharer (she's not a sister anymore) lmk that she invaded all my personal property including my phone and diary and told me she wishes i get beaten by a group of people on the street and that i get pregnant only to suffer. Despite never meeting my bf, she tried to tell me that he doesn't love me and will leave me anytime soon so family is more important. There's a reason they haven't met. She's toxic in every way and my mom lets her be. She's never once even admitted she was wrong or stood up for me. I felt myself so angry and almost lost it and punched her in the face in front of her 1yo. I shoved her out of my room instead and cried and since birth she's always made fun of me for crying. Every. Single. Time. She laughs in my face and tells me i have nothing to cry about. She has this attitude that simply because she has been alive longer, nothing she could possibly do could ever be wrong. It feels like I'm gonna have a heart attack just thinking about her and yesterday after my bf picked me up away from my disgusting mother sharer.  i felt faint and like my heart would give out any moment. I almost want it to, that way I'd be free from anger and the hellish nightmare that is my """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""family""""""""""""""""""""""",1
"Yeah well title says it all, was sitting down trying to draw something I had come up with in mind from earlier in the day but I couldn't get It right and suddenly  I went off . Threw my bike around a bit, kicked over the couches, gave my ironing board the power of flight, destroyed a sketchbook (surprisingly enough most of the art survived) and threw around (and broke) some chairs (they were shit anyway)

Haven't gotten around to cleaning up yet, it happened probably not 20 minutes minutes ago and honestly I am still pretty mad

I seriously dont know what to do about outbursts like this ",1
"I want to know why the beautiful, popular people of the world find it their personal moral duty to bully less liked, less attractive people of the world to suicide? Is it because they think they need to clear out the gene pool? Is it because animals on the nature channel do it, so we should too? I'd say if you are able to recognize the cruelty of that, you then have a moral duty NOT to do it. Not to double down on it! In fact, most of those unattractive, awkward, weird people were getting abused at home by their families or partners. They didn't need you to help them feel like shit. They were raised in it.

I'm an older student returning to a college campus after more than 15 years since my undergraduate degree was barely earned. I was chronically ill and fighting like a dog to finish, and I did. I am here getting a masters now. I find myself fantasizing about beating in the faces of beautiful sorority girls or shooting into a crowd of people. I fantasize about laying in traffic until the police come, screaming the whole time about how ""Didn't you know all those losers you pick on come from abusive families and are already in enough immense pain that your ridicule is just fuel for the fire? Don't you know you can't get away with hurting people anymore now that I'm around? You're all going to die.""

I'm so angry and I'm really terrified about these feelings. I've never had this much anger. Normally I direct it all toward myself, through suicidality. I've at times thought about yelling at people and getting into a fist fight but I have never felt this strongly about it to where I feel like if someone looked at me funny while I am in the midst of this thought process that I actually WOULD rush them and climb on top of them and just mindlessly beat their face bloody. My road rage has been getting worse, too, and I'm scared. I walked into my office over the weekend and found that someone had unplugged my computer and plugged a VOIP phone into that port. I literally wanted to storm down to the IT office and start screaming and throwing things. I need my computer's internet connection. Was it not clear the way I had the desk set up that a laptop is usually plugged in there and I just took it home with me? If i act like this it will ruin my career. THis is what happened to my dad, my abuser, and I can't let it happen to me.

I've only recently come to terms with the immense abuse I suffered as a kid and how it shaped my entire life. I feel like I can never ever get it back and I'm terrified that the self hate and depression and lack of motivation I feel will never go away now. The chance for that is long gone because I didn't confront my abuse soon enough. As a child I wasn't allowed to call it that. My mom actively discouraged me from ever telling anyone about what my dad was doing because she didn't want our family to get broken up or get in trouble. I hate that parents do this. They completely ignore their child's well being in order to save face.  These people should be locked up in prison forever.

I don't want to commit mass murder. I just keep feeling like I want to and I need help. I am afraid to tell my therapist about this because I don't want her to call the police. I want help so that the police don't have to get involved.",1
"Few weeks ago I made a small list of things I could try and do to manage my anger the best I could. Breathing exercises never worked so I thought some life style changes would go well

Now I basically just ignored the list for a while until I remembered while flipping around my phone and well I thought why not start with what I can do right now in the middle of the night

As of now my ps4, switch, 360 and other junk are all locked away in a big chest I have in my room as well as uninstalling steam, time to see how this goes 

List (Cutdown version)
---------------------------------
-go outside more

-try and be around people more 

-less screen time

-excercise more

-cut out video games 

Etc etc

Will this do anything? Probably not but why not try maybe I'll like it a lot more anyways, probably need someone who actually knows what they are talking about to help but that can come later 

Arrivederci

At least 70% of them were casually sexist, racist, transphobic, homophobic... every time I stand up to it I'm told to 'calm down' or 'not care so much'. It drives me mental.

"But I once saw it written that anger for an individual was in fact just grief. They learned through introspection that they were only angry because they were grieving. My teacher Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist master, has said that when we discover the source of our anger we will discover a supreme lightness of mind and spirit. He has also written that our anger is our wounded inner child. This paints a scene for me.

I see a sad little boy, maybe 5 or 6. He is lonely and afraid and he is suffering. His mother has just yelled at him and he cannot understand why, except that it caused him to feel very hurt and scared. Normally his mother is so tender and loving and he can look to her for safety. But her behavior was just terrible and he doesn’t know what to do. He wants to cry but he is worried she might yell at him again. This little boy is inside of me, and he is housed in a little shell of anger. In there he is isolated, trapped, and even desperate. But he is safe inside of my anger. He can be protected there for now.

But he needs to be grieved for. He needs to be held and loved by me again. He needs my apology for having left him alone in there for such a long time. Over that time the shell only grew thicker and more rotten. He needs to grieve for what he lost, for the love he needed but didn’t receive. I need to grieve with him. I need to let him out of that shell so he can live safely as a part of my life, so my anger will fade.

Thank you for reading this despite the title and I hope that it will speak to you and help. If you are interested in learning more about what I have learned from Thich Nhat Hanh on anger, I highly recommend his book, ‘anger: wisdom for cooling the flames’. Anger is like potatoes, he says. It takes a while to cook.",1

I feel like my mind is changing; I can't control it anymore. A part of me doesn't even want to change, because it's comforting to know that people who led me to become depressed are suffering. I'm afraid it will get worse with time. I'm especially afraid that I will appease my anger with physical actions.

A little bit of a backstory, my whole life I grew up being abused but I was docile and quiet I was kind to everyone around me. Then I was in 3 abusive relationships back to back , I was also kind and quiet and tried to do everything in my power to love these people, now my current partner who is not physically abusive, we have issues arguing. It was fine for about a year and then all of a sudden I started to get really nasty, telling him to off himself, telling him I hated him, telling him I was better off without him even though that's not true all sorts of things it just feels like it's coming out of my mouth without control. I have physical and mental disabilities so at the time I was on quite a bit of medication and I started a new one and went into what was thought to be Mania, suddenly I started hallucinating and I started trying to take the wheel and drive us off Bridges , I would hit him I would scream, I would try to kill myself almost on a daily basis I was in the hospital all the time and then one day I snapped and tried to stab him , days before I pulled a machete out, there were holes in the walls from me stabbing them I had even stabbed through my own hand without feeling it from how angry I was. I wasn't on any drugs other than marijuana, no drinking either. Eventually I snapped and when at him with scissors I believe with the full intention to kill him , but I was really delusional at the time so I don't fully remember why he really didn't do anything. The cops got called and I went to jail , once I was done hallucinating and out of that mindset I just couldn't believe what was happening it was traumatizing. I took myself off of all the medication , and I got better stopped smoking pot a little bit better. 

Now my concern today is, I think it's starting to happen again and I thought it was medication-induced it's pretty much my worst fear for this to start happening again and I'm scrambling to figure out what to do I'm getting suicidal I would rather kill myself than hurt him. I snapped and hit him yesterday I was so angry I was literally almost blacking out, I haven't felt that way since I took myself off the medication which was about 6 months ago everything has been pretty normal since that happened and now suddenly this is happening again, I wielded a knife in my hand screaming at him and eventually snapped myself out of it and now I'm just so so scared I can't afford for this to happen , I'm finally getting my life together I'm going into college soon to become a psychologist I'm working off community service to get that charge dropped I've been doing really well on my new medication I don't know what's going on",1
"Okay so i'm feeling completely like shit. Its not a huge deal but yesterday I took our recycling out and we keep it in one of those plastic storage containers with three shelves. Well big dumb stupid me lost it and can't remember. I feel like i'm so fucking retarded. Like literally whenever I lose something or do something really stupid I feel like i'm a complete retard and will fly off the handle and beat myself up and talk about how I wish I could just be left alone or be put on disability or something since normal people don't lose things or aren't forgetful, or don't get angry over stupid little things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is I've always been this way. When I was 6 I used to beat myself up when I couldn't beat a level of donkey kong. I felt stupid. I also got bullied at school. A lot of it was because I just was odd and I hated when other people called me that. It was to the point I threatened a kid in 5th grade. Worse thing was it happened later. I was bullied after being called gay (i'm a straight white male and I guess I hated being called that) and also just felt like I was socially ignored, so I threatened people. I felt bad, but honestly it also felt like a release. Its like people didn't leave me alone or listen until I was angry. Granted I also got in trouble so I tried my hardest not to be angry anymore. It still happened.

&amp;#x200B;

In college I remember how I'd get upset when I worried that i'd fail. Strangely enough I did well in college. I still felt socially like I was weird and awkward and that people were just fake nice to me (that's another thing. I have this belief people are only really honest when they are angry. Maybe i'm projecting or maybe that's what I do. I don't know) and I still had outburst where i'd hit myself or yell or scream. Once I even smashed a plate of cookies and I lied and said I tripped over the table they were on. Yeah, no one believed that.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course it kept going on. I taught school but i'd get mad when students were not very nice to me. I still got mad when I lost things, or when I lost at games. Honestly, I just feel so angry, but its tough because I'm a nice person. Its not like i'm just hulking around waiting to blow up. Its like when a storm comes up on a nice day. Its almost out of nowhere even though there are signs of a trigger.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I just hate it. I'm 30 and I still throw tantrums like i'm a fucking baby bitch three year old. 30 year olds don't do that unless they want to be put in a mental hospital. It almost makes me wish I could just go to a doctor and tell him to take the parts out of my brain that make me angry easily. Even if I was a vegetable at least i'd never hurt anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

What sucks too is that while I want it gone, it also feels like a release. I get this weird feeling when i'm upset that I have to keep going. Its almost like i'm acting in a play. I can only let go of the anger if I let it out, or else it will just sit there until the pressure builds. Its why sometimes I just wish I could have brain surgery since counseling or medication don't seem to help much. I just hear the same old BS anyways of breathing deeply and being nice to myself. Big whoop. Lets just give everyone participation trophies and tell everyone that its okay to be a loser and that failure is okay. Life is shit and I guess sadly i'm one of those losers for whom life sucks. 

&amp;#x200B;

So is their anything I can do to get rid of my anger? Its tough because in some ways I don't want to. Its my way or releasing, but I know other people are hurt by it.  I just feel so sick that I can't just get rid of it, but its to the point I don't even know if I truly want to. I guess all I want is acceptance because I feel my anger is a disability. Its not like I choose to get angry. But maybe I do and i'm just an immature man child brat.",1

"I need help trying to channel my anger into something positive rather than negative like hitting walls, pillows, myself, and yelling at my cats and dogs when I’m at a breaking point. I never really wanted to confront myself about my issues because I was scared to say that I had anger issues but I’m more worried about my animals and my loved ones being afraid of me and my unpredictable behavior when i’m angry.

"I find myself at 27 developing the same hate and anger and rage I had in my early 20s. 23 to 26 I calmed down a lot. I've never been an aggressive or violent person in any circumstance but in my early twentys I had a boiling anger and hatred inside and I wouldn't hesitate to retaliate in any aggressive circumstances. Thankfully it never resulted in physical violence. 

But now I've recently started having this same emotion come and stay - if this emotion develops more for me I am going to become a hazard. I'm not a small dude ( I've been a butcher for 8 years and it's a physical job ) and as such now I wonder if I will become an explosive angry adult. Has anyone else experienced this as they get into their late 20s.
Little sleights by others against me are now making me incredibly mad and it's not a good thing, I will look up ways to handle my anger should this happen.
Any thoughts or opinions on this would be great",1
"My brother’s episodes worry me. His girlfriend has confided in me about their arguments, and how intense he gets. Whether it’s a learned behavior or if it’s in our genes, I understand where he’s coming from. Our dad is awesome, and he’s come such a long way since we were kids, but he definitely had a temper. As a girl, my temper manifested differently.  I silently withdrew and took things out on myself when I was angry. My brother gets an intense look in his eyes, gets in his girlfriend’s face (or mine if I’m the trigger of his anger) and points aggressively. Although he wouldn’t lay a hand on anyone (I don’t think), his body language, his tone of voice, and his facial expressions all invoke fear in me when I see him angry. It gives me a pit in my stomach. I would call it emotional abuse. 

His episode this weekend ruined what could’ve been a really fun night. I don’t think he remembers what really happened, but the next day all he said to his girlfriend and I is “I owe you guys an apology”. Even though alcohol was involved, I don’t think that’s an excuse. 

Is it okay if I call him today to gently say his anger worries me? Any tips or suggestions for how to tell a loved one they have a problem? I’ve told him before but it was always in the heat of an argument. ",1
"I was never an angry person at all. No traumatic events, no anxiety or mental health problems at all. Everybody generally knows me for how kind I can be. But today, I just lost it once I got home. The rage started when I realised that I'd lost my $10 bill. Then every little thing and thought started to make me angry. Uncentered pillow, homework, mom calling me, etc. It got to the point where I just started swinging at the air from pure rage, jumping and stomping on the ground, and slamming drawers and doors. From the title you probably know that much of my anger was pent up. I don't want this to happen at a bad time or against a friend.",1
"BTW I'm a small female in case that puts things into perspective. I'm not a large dude just walking around laying into small people that try to hit me and I wouldn't ever touch someone much younger or smaller than me but I get intimidated when it's someone my size or larger.                  

       
When I was younger I used to get beat over stupid shit and since I couldn't get help I realized my only option was to fight back. And ever since then a switch just goes off in me when someone lays a hand on me in an aggressive way while they're already pissed off. I feel so much burning rage, and the other person is already pissed off too so it gets bad.           
        
       

The last time this got me in trouble, was with a manager. I wasn't supposed to leave my podium but a customer had spilled something and no one was helping her, and she was looking at me like ""why are you just standing there"" so I went over to help her and in the middle of doing so, my boss grabbed me by the shirt and forcefully started pulling me away while yelling ""how many times do I have to tell everyone to stay in their place?!!"". I immediately smacked her hard to release her from pulling on me. And got sent home, and almost fired. I couldn't help it, it was just so fucking disrespectful and embarrassing to be pulled away like a toddler.                           
              
Another time, someone had bumped into me on accident and I said something like ""geeze"" and she gave me the dirtiest look ever then purposely pushed me all pissed off so I decked her and she started crying. And I took off.       

I mean it's a really good emotion to have when I truly need to stick up for myself but my brain can't just understand there are some things I can't react to.        
         
It's going to get me into more trouble I can handle one of these days.

"My partner is naturally angry, but all that rage is pent-up with no way to express it... I was hoping to gift her a way to let it all out.

I was imagining her swinging a mallet into household items, smashing them into smithereens. But I can't seem to find any 'rage rooms' in London (UK).

I'm thinking about putting this together myself... I'd just need to find a mallet, safety goggles and discarded everyday items.

Just wanted to see if anybody has any ideas or knowledge that can help! Or if anybody knows the best place to find the above items, that would be appreciated! Thanks",1
"Nothing much to elaborate on. My mother just called me over the phone as she's wont to do every two weeks or so and for some reason, I just got really irritated. I felt like I had been interrupted even though I was just browsing on the internet. These anger issues have been affecting me for a while now. I've come pretty close to breaking my laptop on multiple occasions in the past couple of weeks. Of course, I have more restraint in public because if there's one thing my anxiety is good for, it's ensuring that I don't have any emotional reaction at all by basically being a statue. Nevertheless, I had to make a little effort not to punch my laptop screen in a library yesterday, which I guess is big. I feel like I'm irritated by a lot of things nowadays.",1

"Don’t know where to start. Twenty year vet, 3 combat deployments as a medic and did some mental health support stuff. Been married for about 10 years and recently had a baby boy (just under 4 months). I feel like i am a happy go lucky kind of guy, usually get along with everyone I meet and have good relationships with people. My wife and I have a great relationship except when my anger flares up, and that’s (I feel) usually caused by her. 

I can tolerate her moodiness and backlash until I can’t, then I blow up. I don’t touch her or get physical but I have gotten verbally blatant with her, probably abusive - and I hate this about myself. I don’t feel I start our fights, my wife is very particular about stuff and she will tend to talk down to me, at least that’s how it feels to me before I react. For example, if I’m on the couch and I get up to go to bed or do something else, she will get at me for not putting the couch back in order, like fluff the pillows and put them back I guess. She’ll get on me and tell me how she’s not my maid and I’m a grown man and I should pick up after myself, which I get I am not asking anyone to pick up after me but it’s just not a big deal to me or I figure I’ll do it later, granted maybe I’ll forget and not do it. I just don’t feel I deserve that kind of tone and attitude, I’m her husband. So then I feel attacked, get offended and say something smart ass-y like I don’t get on you for leaving shoes all over the house, then she says well I’m the one picking them up so don’t worry about my shoes. Anyway, I’ll end up blowing up and then it becomes all my fault and I’m the monster for having an anger issue and not getting help. 

I take accountability, I shouldn’t blow up to the level I do. I become irate, loud, and very mean. This is just one example. I’ve tried to talk to her about how she talks to me but all she says is that she didn’t mean to be demeaning and that’s just how her house was growing up, everyone was just direct with each other. 

Anyway, things get better, we do better, and then the cycle starts over. Next time it will be about how I didn’t clean my bathroom, or clear out the fridge, etc. Well now we have a baby in the picture and I don’t want to blow up this way and traumatize our baby. I’ve seen counselors, it’s been about 2 years since the last time, and they help a little bit, but I just want to get to the root of my issue and start treating it from there.

I know it has to start from within me, even though I feel she is the trigger, I want to be able to control myself and lead us in a better direction. Like I mentioned, I worked as a mental health tech during one of my deployments and learned about relaxation, guided imagery, counting to ten, reframing my thoughts, but it feels like it doesn’t work for me.

"They are literally responsible for the best and worst aspects of my life. There are a lot more of bad aspects though.

My depression from being bullied was fueled even more by them yelling at me when I needed an open ear

They refused to get me help with my problems because ""people could think we're the worst parents in the world""

Being incredibly rude to me at times and there were 2-4 times where she actually began to hit me. No matter what I would never do anything to her, and always did my best to show my love and care, but eventually I began to slowly have a building of anger with no way take it out. It would boil to where I eventually just punch walls or any inanimate object I feel could take the beating when I was alone. When she eventually broke up with me I felt destroyed, but the anger never went away. Only burnt in deeper. I eventually began to workout to relieve my stress and that helped incredibly, but than she called me about a week ago  after a month of no contact.

This sent me on a sprint of hope, and I began to think about her every single night even more than I did the last time. Today rolls around and I finally decide to text her and talk to her about our last conversation. I began the conversation very lightly and slowly eased into it. Asking how her week has been. Her nights out, and anything else I could before I eventually began to talk about our last conversation and the way it went. She than told me that it had just been awhile since she last talked to me and needed someone that understood her to talk to and share things with.

"Alright so a bit of information about me so some helpful people out there can give me advice. I’m a 19 (f) and I’ve known for most of my life I’ve been a very short tempered person and get annoyed easily. 

However, I notice there are only a couple things that stand out that seem to be my triggers, my mom (a whole separate story) when shit happens, video games, and people I’m very close too. For the most part though majority of people in my life have never seen or expected this side of me. I keep it pretty private, but I still don’t like feeling like this. 

As of recently I’ve been very short tempered with my boyfriend and I hate myself for it, i don’t want to blame it on him. Others I’ve been close to in the past I see patterns in myself where I act the same way. I get annoyed or upset about something and for some reason feel compelled to get angry about it and it turns into an argument. Sometimes there’s reasons but a lot of the times i blow things up or pick on small things. 

When my anger gets pretty bad which is when I feel the need to hit things. Never a person, it’s always been like a wall or table. This might be a stretch but i feel that when hitting something it inflicts pain on myself, it gives my mind a distraction. I don’t think about what I’m mad about I’m just like “ouch my hand hurts” lol but I don’t want to hit things either because I just don’t think that’s healthy either. 

One thing I’ve learned to do is when I do get mad is walk away and cool off, I try to watch funny videos and usually in about 10 minutes I feel better for the most part. However, I want to find ways to stop myself from getting mad at all. I don’t want to be short tempered or easily annoyed, I hate these traits about myself and I want to learn ways to fix it. ",1
"*throwaway account*

My biggest fears are going to jail and ending up alone or ending up broke.  I know that in my current state I have learned to control my anger for the most part  but if i have a certain amount of frustration or stress and someone says the wrong thing at the wrong time, I’m capable of snapping in the most damaging way to not only my potential victims life but also my own.

I last got in a fight 4 years ago.  I was a senior in high school. Varsity Goalie of the hockey team with my high school. After a joint alumni game, a freshman forward from a different team in our locker room was slapping me on the back as hard as he could. He did it about 5 times before I even told him to stop. Even after I told him to, he kept going. I had enough, I threw a punch at his jaw and screamed in his face like a complete psychopath.  My teammates thought I was going to kill him that night.  I’m not just coming to the realization now, I came to my senses about 2 hours after the incident and my anger had worn off.  I apologized to him a week after the incident took place, but if i ever come face to face with him again, I think I owe him another apology. When I played hockey, I tried to pick fights during rec league games for the hell of it. Now I know it was just so dumb. I don’t play ice hockey any more, not competitively anyway, just for fun and fighting isn’t even on my mind when I play anymore. 


Even today I still hang around certain people (one or 2 people, the rest are amazing)  who I consider amazing friends but I know are toxic. My biggest fear is fucking going crazy on them. I’m in film school now and am aiming for a career in making music videos and advertisements. Whenever I am editing and my computer is being laggy I scream at it like it’s a human being. Weirdly enough I don’t have the heart to treat another human like that anymore. Maybe it’s still some lingering psycho in me but I’m scared it will come back full force at some point.

I’m even scared to talk about a lot of shit to my therapist. Idk why but I guess I’m trying to maintain a face of a normal functional human being. I do a good job of presenting that most of the time. My coworker caught me punching myself over winter break. We both laughed it off as I did my best to cover up the breakdown I was having in that moment.


I’m just deep in thought, drunk after celebrating my best friends 21st and I understand I’m all over the place with my words.  I just felt like getting that out there.

"Okay, so, I'm still in my teenage years and as everyone knows, they can be a pretty rough time in life, however I wouldn't necessarily say I have the roughest life. My parents recently split up about a few months ago and it hasn't bothered me in anyway (except for angry outbursts), I'm currently living with my dad and my older sister and we're a little tight on money.

I've always had an issue with anger, I use to slam my head into the ground as a kid when I didn't get what I want and I still am very self destructive  to this day (biting, scratching, punching). I never show my (extreme) anger to anyone but myself in my room and I usually get so angry that I emotionally tire myself, leaving myself in tears. As, I said, I'm very self destructive, so I don't punch walls (mostly because our house is rented) and I don't cuss at other people, I berate myself until I'm calm.

My mother is very petty when it comes to issues with my dad and I think that's where my temper comes into play the most, whenever I go to talk to her about something, say getting a dog (we recently got two), she turns around and yells at my dad about spending money on useless things, than my dad turns around and yells at me.

It's an endless cycle that is seriously starting to piss me off to be honest. I hate agruing because I can never speak properly without crying or just getting more and more angry. I've also discovered that sometimes sounds also throw me into a fit of rage, like when everyone is just talking too much or too loud or when I hear a sound I'm practically sensitive to, I was babysitting last night and almost screamed at the kids because they were so loud in my ear.

Is this normal?",1
"I’m 17 Female. When I was 12 my mom became severely disabled due to an injury and lost most motor functions and a lot of her memory, this caused me to develop anger issues. My dad has really bad anger issues and I guess I got it from him and it never showed up until I essentially lost my mom. Anyways I have a little brother (11) who is undiagnosed functioning autistic, in the past I have lost my temper with him (My dad is now a single father so I have taken on a lot of the parenting role for my brother) I would end up beating the crap out of him over the smallest stuff. Tiny annoyances would build up over weeks until I couldn’t help it and I would end up hitting him and then I would break down crying because I love him more than anything and I hate myself for hurting him. It’s like I can’t control myself because I’m filled with so much rage. I’ve been going to therapy since I lost my mom and that helped a lot. I haven’t hurt him in about 2 months and before that it was about 6 months. Despite all of that we somehow have a great relationship which is really sad because I don’t want my brother to accept the way I treat him when I’m angry. He is so kind and loving and I hate myself for hurting him. Anyways I’ve been relatively calm over the last few months until today, I was driving my boyfriend (16M) and my brother somewhere when the guy behind me honked at me (I was turning left and so was he but I had to wait on the traffic to clear and this guy was steady laying on the horn at me!) anyways I started honking my horn furiously and I rolled down my window and shot him the bird. Then I realized that we were going to the same place, I drove into the parking lot holding the horn down and I put my car in park but didn’t turn it off. I ran out of my car (and left the door open) towards his car, he got out and started making angry gestures at me and then my boyfriend ran up and had to physically restrain me (I’m 5’0 103lbs and the guy in the other car was a buff bald dude) and carry me back to the car. I’ve never had road rage this bad before, I’ve flipped a few people off but never anything his severe. I could have gotten my brother and my boyfriend killed. I honestly don’t know what to do about my anger issues. I sat in the car and cried because I hate myself when I explode like that. I’m so scared that one day I will lash out at my brother again or at my boyfriend (he seems to be one of the few people who can keep me calm when I’m angry and I love him so much for that) my brother is so sweet to me and he has told me that he understands my anger issues (our dad is the same way but just yelling, he got past the physically lashing out part of it in his 20’s)  I don’t want the people I love to be scared of me. Any advice at all would be really appreciated. 

TL/DR I have a history of lashing out physically and today I had an extreme case of road rage that put the people I love in danger. I’m afraid that my anger issues will cause me to hurt the people I love more than I already have ",1
"**I want to figure out how to address my anger behind video games.**  
**I want to learn how to grow some self-esteem.**  
**I want to control myself and stop saying horrible things to people.**  
**I want to learn to trust people and how to interact with them.**

  


I'm embarrassing my friends, making a fool of myself, and saying horrible things that make me hate who I am. ( It isn't just throwing around vulgarity either, It's seriously messed up stuff that could get me in trouble, but when I calm down and realize what the hell I'm saying it's both embarrassing and shameful. Even if it's strangers on the internet, there is still a lot of guilt building up from saying horrid things I'd never say to another human being if I was thinking clearly.)  
Games I used to enjoy are no longer fun.  
I've had to take over a year break from Overwatch and rainbow six siege.  
I've been playing a ton of Warframe and Vermintide 2 however as of recently.  


I used to be somewhat decent at both, and used to have fun with the games.  
I never do as good as I used to, and now I immediately get angry and toxic when I die, even if I know it was my fault I died. I try to blame game mechanics instead of accepting my skill level isn't where it needs to be. Any sort of toxic response back, even if I provoked it, always bothers me for far longer than it would anyone else, and I believe it's because I have low self-esteem. Not only that, but it seems like I constantly try to use video games as a measure of my skill because I feel like I'm not good at much else, or even that interesting of a person outside of playing games.  
I'm tired of getting so upset at video games that I act like a complete manchild. I want to learn how to build some self-esteem and believe that I don't have to prove myself anytime I get on a video game and play.  


I genuinely feel so angry all the time and I just want to love myself and treat others kindly. Even if someone is talking smack I want to learn how to ignore it, instead of impulsively snap a comment back at them.  I've always hated myself and thought that I'm confined to video games skill-wise because it's all I've done my entire life. My lack of self-esteem is to the point where I don't even try to socially interact with other people at college and I'm a complete shut in. No one talks to me and I don't talk to anyone else unless it's a professor or it's to be polite if they greet me. I'm afraid of the outside world and interacting with others because of what they think of me. I'm afraid to ask for help from a therapist or a doctor and I don't know why; it might be that I just generally distrust people after people have hurt me in my life and I've never developed the skills other people obtain to cope with that pain and grow from it. Even as someone who drives an hour to and from college it's to the point where I struggle to talk with someone at a drive through window and I avoid human interaction if it's possible. I feel so unhappy about everything and I hate that I whine so much as well. It's frustrating because when I wake up it's going to either be a mundane and slow day, or a just a horrible one.  


Another issue is that I feel like I need to be in a relationship 24/7 to feel validated.  
(I have many supportive online friends, but I always feel like I need a relationship because otherwise I feel alone and depressed.)

Before my ex in high school broke up with me 2 years ago, I was functioning well, being responsible, and following good morals. I didn't get as angry, I didn't throw tantrums, I didn't shut myself in and I tried many new things, I was social and would talk with people even if they where a stranger. After I broke up with her (for a multitude of reasons; a few being of her constantly emotionally hurting me and taking advantage of me.) I was afraid of being alone so I crawled back to her. After she denied me I went into a deep sadness for most of that year. This year I'm not as upset about all the stuff in the past and realize it's better that I didn't get to go back to that situation, but a lot of my old habits that I had before I was in a relationship started coming back out, and I'm starting to act like an idiotic edge lord when I just want friends, to be accepted, and to find love. I'm so tired of feeling alone. I want to apologize to my family for the way I've been acting as of recently too, but I'm too filled with shame to even consider approaching them.  
   
The constant anger and sadness in my life, lead me to act poorly in times when people need me to be mature. I don't have the energy some days to be responsible and take care of things I need to. I get upset to the point where I feel like a lost cause, and I feel like I can't talk to my parents because of how horrible a son I am.  


I'm sorry if this was messy and all over the place, but I really need help and I don't know where else to look.  
I just know that I'm at my wits end and I  can't keep going through life like this, and I want to change for the better.",1
"For example, if I walk into a door, or stub my toe, i'll kick the door extremely hard or punch the table, anyone else get this?",1
"Hey fellow angry people I’m beyond livid I’m beyond boiling I’m beyond pissed and I’m trying not to blow up on people who haven’t done anything wrong because there is only one person I’m anger at and I can’t blow off some steam by punching them straight to Hell... so uh any advice would be great.
Thanks in advance all my love (in the least angry way possible)",1
"Ever since I was little, the only way I dealt with my anger is through self harm. First it was punching and scratching myself, then stabbing myself with pencils, and final evolved into cutting. I’m self destructive to say the least. And that goes for any slight mistake or anything less than perfection.

It’s far from healthy and I know that, which is why I’m asking if there’s any small ways to start getting better. Any help is appreciated.",1
"Not entirely sure if that's what I have, FoA, could just be Intimacy in general, but I hit every single bullet point for FoA except one. It stems from a childhood of physical and emotional abuse, if that helps.

But yea, I used to be beat (for lack of a better term) on a daily basis because I had anger issues. I now understand my childhood anger as being a symptom of the abuse, a self-fulfilling prophecy, but it has left me scarred in more ways that one.

Now I can't express anger. At least not willingly or especially sober. I feel it, trust me, but ive been so conditioned to bury it that I'm sitting on at least 2 decades worth of sheer fury. Quite honestly, it's not even anger, it's to the point where I'm worried I'll boil over and kill someone. It's not like I have any moral compass anymore, the sole reason I haven't is because I don't want to deal with the hassle.. seriously. I'd kill myself first.

Now, I'm obviously aware how unhealthy and dangerous this is. I wouldn't make a post otherwise.. but I need a way to release my rage as well as feel validated, in the moment, for whatever is currently making my blood boil. Because quite frankly, all I was taught to do was to hide it or you're not gonna see for a week. There's never been a time in all 21 years of my life, that anyone has ever /really/ cared enough that I could even have a minor outburst.. something normal people do all the time.

I've gone through physical abuse, neglect, and emotional abuse due to my family. Found a relationship and started dating a similarly damaged girl only for her to ghost me after well over 4 years together. Literally ghosted me... So I've learned to trust no one, which prevents me from seeing a therapist (I will lie if forced to go, and will never voluntarily go.), Venting to my family (else it turns into a blame game and just adds to the fire that I'm not allowed to release.), Or even venting to someone who you trust with your everything..

They all leave, and I'm the one stuck with this never ending rage. And don't tell me to breath, I know how to bottle it up, but thank you. I'd even bet that I'm better at it than most people here, the not expressing anger part. The don't break shit, curse, or even let your smile fad from your face part. The problem is, it never goes away, and validating why, because my history and my now fears due to every single relationship (all, not just romantic) I've ever had proving not to trust others... Does nothing.

Edit: Also wanted to note, any kind of visualisation or whatever just makes me imagine myself putting my head through a window... Very vividly. So that's also out, no expressing anger in my head. It will leak out, I need to find a safe way to blow up. I haven't gotten to blow up since I graduated high school and got out of football. (Kept me sane for years, despite being part of my neglect. I hate sports. Utterly and completely hated every second of every sport I've ever played, which is quite a few. Three sports every year, all year, since I was 6, till I turned 18. All forced participation.) So I don't have any desire to go back to playing sports, just noting that it was very effective for me to be able to fully give into my bloodthirst. This need to make others feel an inkling of what I feel constantly.",1
"Okay so like many of you here in this subreddit I have severe anger issues. I let things build on me until it overflows and explodes in a fiery pit of rage and disrespect. 

I typically don't confront the person I feel wronged by until I'm furious and at that point if I do confront said person it's an anger fueled explosion of ""fuck you's"" and ""how dare you"". I wait so long because I think ""what's the point if said person is going to be rude and just piss me off further"".

Today was one of those days, but I curbed it. Feeling stressed and it was either I confront this person or the problem gets worse and worse, but I knew, I know I can't blow up, so I managed to pull my shit together long enough to ask this person if they were aware of their mistake. I wasn't met with rage or anything of the sort, I was instead met with confusion, confusion that forced us to explain ourselves and realize it was just a miss-communication, the mother of all issues. We talked and hashed out a plan sonit disnt happen again and I just thought I needed to share how easy it would have been to blow up and cause further issues and how hard it was to just talk but ultimately was for the best.

"My anger has only grown over the years. I have extreme anger towards certain things. 

The sounds. Im just very irritated by fucking sounds of crying kids, passing motorbikes and construction to the point it drives me to cry and scream. My neighbours are assholes who won't shut the fuck up. They're ugly ass kids scream and play all day and I am driven to the point where do scream and break stuff and it only upsets my family. I only wish I had the will power to go out and actually murder those kids with my bare hands.

The weather. I am extremely sensitive to both polar opposites of weather. I love winters. But summers are like hell and i have the exact same reaction described above towards hot weather too. My anger causes a lot of headaches and I can't take it. Even mild summers are like hell to me.

My parents/ family. Especially mother trying to control what i do. Nevermind that she isn't a crazy mother but just her or anyone else's presence around me lights a fire inside of me. And when someone annoys me, trying to tell me what to do I want to kill them. Now even if I ask my parents for therapy they won't get me therapy know for sure.

There are loads of other problems in my life that have made me this way. I focus on my anger a little too less thatswhy I think less and act out more.

To this point I feel like my anger is out of control. There is no way I can handle it without being physical and verbal. Please help. I feel scared of myself that I'll actually end up killing myself or drawing blood if my anger grows more.",1

I told him there was a long line and they went up to the front and I was raising my voice saying this is happened time and time again in the store and I’m really getting tired of it. Then at the door everybody was saying thank you and I said here’s the crazy guy raising his voice leaving the store but you’re finally being taken care of. Why did I act so crazy? Why couldn’t I just have told the manager that there was way too long the line and just left it at that. Why did I have to raise my voice like that crazy person? Now they’re going to remember me next time I go in. Why do I do this?

I’ve also been yelling at my kid because he lost something that was very important today. Why am I doing this? Why am I so angry? Are you even woke up and tried to say some prayers and this is what happens? This is what happens?

It's a problem that I'm sure occurs in every family, but we, collectively, need to find a way to handle it better. Very hard to do when two people both KNOW they're right and refuse to budge.

Don't have clear vision how and what i did, but thing is now everyone sees me as calm as Buddha. But there's an inner feeling that anger is still inside me somehow about something, and when i don't express my feeling of anger in EVERY life situations it stores in a tiny place somewhere of my chest until I reach an overload and release whole anger with rainbow of emotions. Recently I noticed that when i reach an overload I lose control so much that i'm not even that angry about current situation, as much im angry about everything and I can't stop myself being angry, can't stop arguing it becomes my propulsion. During that phase I stop caring about environment or either I lose focus I'm in environment I mean sometimes people im in the argue with are my friends who are important to me, but I keep delivering a confrontation 200% and can do that for hours, so they get tired, lose time, can feel unimportant and a lot more. So this anger wave finishes only when someone stops me.

In that type of situations I act alike my father when he is angry, but still why im like that, why cant act like myself and whats that deep anger inside me that wakes up everytime i explode.

Does anyone relate to the story?",1
"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I've (26/M) been a level headed person my whole life, but recently (last 12 months) I've had intense feelings that if anyone was to mess with me the wrong way (robbery or try to harm me or my loved ones) I'd probably flip out. Now these feelings stem from hypothetical scenarios that play out in my head whenever I hear for e.g someone got robbed (phone, wallet etc).

&amp;#x200B;

What bothers me most is that I'm the kind of person who has never harmed anyone in my life intentionally (sure maybe I've accidentally hurt someone but those were very very minor and an instant apology and grovelling fixed it) and if anyone would try to say rob me or harm me or prevent me from getting what I am rightfully owed, I would flipping flip out, like go all out war on them with from extremely deadly firearms (we're kind of gun nuts as well).

&amp;#x200B;

What exacerbates my fears is that I've recently (last 12 months) acquired my first firearm and I don't know what might happen. What if I accidentally hurt or kill or permanently disable someone else in my quest for self defense or even get myself killed (not that I'm afraid of dying but it would be a bummer for my loved ones lol)

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I thankfully haven't ever been robbed or had someone try to murder me or harm me but the fear lingers and it's terrifying how that might play out. I would probably just give them what material things they want but the real fear is if they have other intentions to harm me or my family members. And I have some faith that something like this will probably never happen but the countless stories of scams, robberies, murders on the rise are scaring me.

&amp;#x200B;

And

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a lawless country, survival of the fittest etc. We try to lay as low as possible to avoid any possible confrontation with literally any person at all. I come from an extremely passive and non aggressive family and it's worked pretty well thankfully. The last person to participate in any ""action"" was my great uncle like 50-70 years ago and he got shot and died right there.

&amp;#x200B;

And 99.9% psychiatrists are scammers here so that's a big no no. I've been to 2 psychiatrists in a western country and they've helped me tremendously in other matters.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the tower of text. I would highly appreciate any advice, thank you.",1
"Yesterday was not any different than any other day. I did become frustrated towards the end of it though when I was trying to pick up a prescription for a recent procedure I had just had. 

I had been trying to get this prescription since Saturday, but every time the system kept saying something regarding the insurance it had on file for me wouldn’t allow me to use the discount card, so instead of owing $30 for the medicine, I had to pay $300. I couldn’t afford that. They just kept sending my in circles all week. I became so frustrated that I wanted to yell at the pharmacist, so I just walked away from her mid-sentence so that I wouldn’t be mean to her when she’s just doing her job. 

As soon as I got to my car I just lost it. I had to scream. That wasn’t enough. I bit myself. I bit down so hard that it hurts to even run my finger along it. I started scratching myself and sleeping and punching myself in the face. I drove home, somewhat okay and then my mother kept asking me questions and it just made me more angry and hurt myself some more. Finally I just jumped in the shower and started cutting myself. I never cut myself but I didn’t know what else to do. 

I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. I feel like I just threw the biggest tantrum for no god damn reason. I’m in my 20s. I should not be acting like a child. 

My father has severe anger problems and became physically violent towards my mom and brothers during his episodes. I’ve never once wanted to hurt anyone nor have I ever hurt anyone during my episodes, but I do hurt myself because I don’t know what else to do. I feel better. But I know that’s not healthy and I don’t want to keep doing it, but I also don’t know how else to stop. 

Please tell me that there is something wrong with me and that I can fix this and this is not just me being childish. I need to know that there is hope for me to get better. ",1
As the title says I need help now. Ive been having anger issues for about a 2 years now and it’s been getting worse but every time I acknowledge it I just go back to ignoring it and seeing the hell I leave behind me. It began with the feeling coming up at random but now it’s gone to screaming at my siblings and friends and threatening to throw chairs. (I wish I was joking). My mom has began getting on me about this and says I’m just like my dad and it hurts me to no end. She keeps blaming the video games as well but like the fucking idiot I am I continue to play them and brush it off as a ‘go to’ blame on anything parents see wrong with you but I’ve come to realize how right she was. I’ve got mutes and suspensions on Overwatch all the way to being permanently banned. Then going on to use my little sister account and giving it the same treatment. Then the wake up moment was when I got my 14 day suspension on league of legends and reviewing my chat I began to cry. I was disgusted with how much pointless hate I had in my heart and decided to just unplug and start focusing at school which made me improve my grades but my relationship with my friends became violent and now a member of our friend group refuses to sit anywhere near me. I’ve been considering suicide with the thought of this never being cured and I’ll become a wife beater or rapist or something and hating my own existence. I used to be in therapy for this but ended up hating every therapy and just cussed them out for “using me for my insurance money” and such. All of them requested to me being sent to another therapist. I’m lost and I don’t want this to take over my life. Should I just end it? Am I really hopeless? What can I do? I don’t want any cookie cutter advice like “breathing exercises” cause that shot doesn’t fucking work.,1
"I have been a fairly calm, relaxed fella most of the time. I joined the gym not long ago, and I have noticed a sharp incline in my anger.

Last week, I punched a hole through a wooden wall (thinking about the past). And just tonight, I broke my two PS4 Dualshocks (which I had for three years) because I died in a game. These are just recent incidents, but I expect more to come. I've also dealt with physical (non-sexual) abuse in the past, where I was unable to do anything, and I still am unable to, which no doubt contributes. 

How can I relieve this anger, if the gym doesn't help? ",1
"The me you know apologizes when I am wrong. The sad fact is that I just don't think I'm wrong often. Except, I am wrong often. I have been wrong. I just couldn't see it. I am now starting to understand the scale of how wrong I have been. I humble myself now, before you, my wife. I take my heart and lay it out before you, with no expectation of whether or not you will receive it. My goal is to be honest so that you and I both, whether together or separate in the long run, can heal from what I've done.

&amp;#x200B;

For years I have been a monster. For years I have been entitled to get things my way by using wit and anger to manipulate conversation. I was only interested in getting my way despite proclaiming to be open-minded. In hindsight I am still trying to accept that I am manipulative, as I cannot always see what I was doing. I did not realize I was poisoning the grounds on which honest discussion took place until new discussion could no longer grow. I don't know how I could have been so abusive. The best way I can understand it is that a deceived mind does not know it is deceived. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been verbally and emotionally abusive. I have said things I don't wish to repeat for shame.  I have said apologies that did not last. I have said hurtful things that have scarred you deeply but I do not even remember. I have made a fool of myself even online. I know what I have done. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.

&amp;#x200B;

Where there should have been a mental process that stopped me from being enraged, or perhaps return me to a better mood, there were nothing. My mind was an entitled pool of ideas that must happen. I was narcissistic not to learn self-control. Though it was not my intention to isolate you from support, it appears that is what has happened, allowing my abuse to continue with no oversight. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have thrown items in anger. I have lashed out at the world thinking it has no feelings so that its ok. I justified my actions because of pain from my past, not realizing that by my own actions I was causing you to live in that pain with me. I was blinded by my ambition for good. Good I was not. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.

I have let my cannabis addiction make the situation worse. I believed myself self-medicating, but I was not careful with dosage and became a heavy user. I justified my smoking until my addiction became more important than our relationship. I promised to remove it from our life and I have not done so. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been asleep to my own madness. You have tried so many things to snap me out of it, but the only thing that could wake me was pain. My anger focused me so much that I could not see the big picture. The destruction I was causing became apparent only when you told me how much I have hurt you. I have been in denial that I am hurtful to you and that I have been careless with my words. I know now that I have been. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have spent my entire life controlled by a broken inner child trying to run away from harm. I need to reprogram my mind and be an adult now. I believe it is possible to heal from emotional abuse. In the general sense and specifically for you and me, if I am diligent and sincere about making radical changes. I will not make a fool out of you. I will get this right. I will prove my healing with action over time. I am trying to learn some new behaviors. I am going to practice this for the rest of my life. My healing is important to me. I want your healing to be important to you.

Thank you for being generous with me.",1
"I had an outburst yesterday that prompted me to seek proper help for the first time in my life. I've already booked a meeting with a psychologist and I'm reading a bunch of stuff on anger management but that won't bear fruit for a while so I kind of need to talk about it somewhere, forgive me.

About me: I've always struggled with anger issues, going from having an outburst once a year to having outbursts every month or so after four years of on-and-off depression and a mutually abusive relationship. I've been trying to address it by myself for about two years but I feel like all the progress I make is just wiped out by the next outburst. 

Now to the outburst. My grandmother died recently and my mother has been extremely stressed by the funeral and the succession. She's staying at my house because she lives out of town and living with her has never been a relaxing experience for me, but this one takes the cake. After a long rant about everything she has to do, she starts laying into me about some important tasks that I've been unable to progress with because of my anxiety and depression. Immediately i realize that I'm getting angry so I tell her to lay off because I can't have this conversation right now. This causes her to lay into me even harder, so after some heated words, with my aunt (also a guest) calling out to me to control my tone of voice, I'm feeling cornered and I decide I have to leave the house. I put on my shoes, visibly angry at this point and tell my Mom I'm leaving, but when I make for the door she physically blocks my path. At this point my vision goes white and I grab her to move her aside, but she starts grappling with me and yelling at me that how dare I lay hands on my mother, so at this point I'm screaming at her face to let go of me. I guide her to the bed in the room so I don't push her onto anything hard and pull my shirt out of her grip, which at this point was already torn. I leave the house to the echo of her screams and take a walk to cool down but the damage is already done.

This is the worst it's ever been with someone but it's not the first time that I've tried to manage my anger by telling other people what's happening to me and then trying to leave the situation. In my experience it only seems to make people act harder against me, and I don't really know what to do. Everyone tells me to calm down but these days I feel like I'm only two steps away from a full blown panic attack or rage episode.

Sorry for venting but I figure this is the place to do it. If anyone has any advice on how to prevent situations from escalating like that, I'd love to hear them.",1
"MY ex was an emotionally abusive fucking cunt. She was a horrible fucking bitch who made me feel like I was always wrong and I was the reason she cheated lied and fucked with me. I hate this fucking girl. She's ruined dozens of relationships for me because of how she's made me feel and think about relationships, I'm a nervous wreck. I want to ruin her life like she's ruined mine, my relationship is struggling rn because I'm an idiot and am so nervous about everything and I'm learning through therapy and my own quietness to stop being nervous. I know people say that this isn't gonna do anything other than cause problems but fuck it, this is what I need to do. She deserves to feel as bad as I do. I want to confront her, make her know what a fucking cunt she is. She tried to get back involved with me when she found out about my relationship and ever since this one hasn't been the same. I blocked her immediately but she's still in my head. What can I do. Im so fucking angry I want to fucking drive away.",1

Sorry about spelling errors (not feeling well and tired and exhausted)

Today around noon my personality took a complete 180.  I had been dealing with arguments with my mom, finals, and some emotional stress.  I haven’t had much time to do art or meditation which help calm me down but I was still happy and cheerful. My mom has been blowing up her problems in my face too, but she appreciates whatever help I give to her.

Today my boss was upset because I kept misspelling a word in a email (if you read my old posts you can see I’ve been making mistakes at work) It was a word that I thought I catched and edited before I sent (maybe I hit undo on accident) but after reading an email from my boss hearing I didn’t, I just...snapped.

 I went from being a pretty chill guy able to handle anything...intonan almost blind rage.

I got in the car, started road raging (I kept yelling”fuck!” And “I Almost got it fucking right this time” and “you fucking idiot” to myself) when I dropped some items at my uncles, off I got upset with some people in my family - they kept saying stop ‘getting angry’ which doesn’t make sense because a) I have been keeping my anger at bay for so long b) telling me to stop getting angry ALWAYS makes me angrier.  I just said sorry and that I had to go and left quickly, and continued to rage in the car, hitting and punching things in the car.  I hope I didn’t break something..

I thought about sending angry messages to my mom and my boss in my raged mindset.  What saved me from making that mistake was going on a jog with my younger brother.  I realized I had to take a chill before I ruin his day, even if I am doomed to be a messed up kid.

After the jog, I sent a email apologizing for the spelling mistake to my boss and providing the boss more info on the projects progress, giving no excuses or indication of being upset.  I considered telling my mom about how bad my day was (especially since she’s taken her anger out on me today) but I simply said “I’ve got a lot of work and needed some a lone time” she had a shitty day too, and I decided I was done making things shitty for others.  My friend offered a chance chat with him, which also clamed things down (didn’t tell him I was angry)

I wrapped up work, worked on classwork, tried to relax listening to podcasts and art (I calmed down a little bit not much). Going to bed I couldn’t help just just still feel angry at myself.  I tried to use positive self talk but then hearing it in my head has started to make me want to yell.

So I’m writing it up here; 

.  I’m never been this this angry, nor have been since my teenage years (where I went through suicidal thoughts, horromones, bullies, and just harboring a lot of grudges) - On other days I’ve had it worse (larger family arguments, parents divorcing, toxic relationships) and didn’t resort to such a level of anger; it’s like the moment I found out I made a mistake...I don’t know what went in my head; it’s like I threw out all rationality and my strategies for coping with anger and just wanted to give into rage.

Going to bed, wonder if I ever had wife or kids...or if my mom found out how angry I was...I wonder if the part of me that rational and thinks stregically and optimistically is just a mask and my anger is who I am.  I...feel really scared of myself and what I might end up doing to people I love  if anger overcomes me.

"Sorry if this is formatted poorly, I’m new  to Reddit and also on mobile. 


Warning for mentions of self harm (if anyone needs that) 


I have had problems with anger for as long as I can remember, and thankfully I rarely take my anger out on others (besides during arguments/fights with siblings) and instead take it out on mostly myself. In the past whenever I was extremely frustrated I would scratch at my thighs, bite my arms, stab myself with pencils in the thigh, etc. Or I’d often break things, ripping apart gifts or smashing random plastic stuff. 

I thought I had been doing better recently, since last semester I did a project in behavior modification class where I tried to regulate my outbursts, but now I’m thinking I probably completely failed. Last week I ripped apart a beloved stuffed animal from my friend, one of the few that has survived over the years and I felt horrible. And today I did harm myself, but not intentionally. I went to eat something I was really looking forward wanted to eat, and found that it was gone. I had been irritable all day, and my impulse control was nowhere to be found. It was in a glass jar, which I smashed against the counter leaving me with a pretty deep cut on my finger. Not enough for stitches, but enough to be really annoying and painful. 

I just feel so dumb and helpless. It’s one thing if I bruise of scratch myself, but making myself bleed all over the place and having to explain it to my family...I feel like I’ve lost so much progress and I don’t know how to start to reverse what I’ve screwed up lately.

TLDR; Hurt myself pretty badly when breaking something out of anger, losing a ton of progress and feeling like crap. 

If anyone has any advice for what to do in these situations, I’d be really thankful. Also, I’m so happy I found this subreddit, I’ve always felt really alone in my struggles with anger so hopefully this place helps out a bit! ",1
"I kind of have a weird relationship with videogames, specifically rocket league. I do well for a bit, then something flips and I get so bad. I lost 2-13. 

When this happens I get so worked up, I physically want to let it out but I cant find a way too, so I sometimes resort to pain (which isnt good but it's my only way). I love the games and I'm completely addicted. 

I also trash talk a lot when I'm angry, enough to get me banned sometimes, I dont like it but it annoys me so much when they dont say anything to my abuse.

I know this isn't healthy at all. I really enjoy video games and want to enjoy online ones, but I just get so angry. I've looked up how to deal with the anger and I've been told to just keep the anger in and take deep breaths. But this just makes me even angrier.

Sometimes I wish I had a knife on me so I could just take care of everything there, and for that reason I leave my self out of range of weapons. Any time I get this impulsive anger, something bad happens. I don't want to go to another person for help, because to me that's saying ""if you're not able to take care of your own problems, you don't deserve to live."" I'm not sure if I'm making sense.

I remember thinking them as a kid too when my parents would tell me to shut my mouth or something that silenced me. Is it terrible to think these things? I don’t want to be abusive and I don’t think I would ever act on it. I don’t want to be in a position of power, I just sometimes think it would be easier to fight physically than to fight with words. Am I terrible person for having these thoughts? I get so incredibly overcome with anger. Sometimes I have to walk away, like right now. I HATE being talked to like I’m stupid ugh. ",1

I drive a pretty big car and i decided to buy myself another car, that is really small compared to my initial car.
Ever since, I felt like I was another person on the road, much calmer one and that affected positively my life off the road as well.

" 

I am 17M. I not an angry person, I love my life, I have good friends, I go to a good school, I live in a shit town but in a good country, I live in a middle class family and I am happy most of the time. However, recently my relationship with my parents has begun to deteriorate, we argue on a daily basis and we rarely talk civilly to one another. We have at least one serious argument every week and it is getting me down. I don't want to spend my life arguing with my parents, it is upsetting my younger brother and I really don't want to be in this state when I leave home at 18 for university. We argue about the most trivial things but it is always escalated to the point of full on yelling, often to the point where I have recently started to leave the house for a walk to prevent myself from doing something irrational.

This happens every other night with something or another, often to do with playing video games so I gave them up this week to see if that would help and after 8 days without playing them nothing has changed. At this point my parents just seem disappointed in me, I do everything I can to impress them, I can play two instruments extremely well, even though I don't enjoy one of them any more (I haven't told them about this in fear of the backlash.) I go to cadets where I have represented the corps in clay target shooting, another passion, which my mum is not keen to support as it involves guns. I have been forced respect this and have given up arguing about continuing it outside of cadets. I was berated through my GCSE's where I was told I would fail if I didn't work over and over even though I was confident in my abilities. I got straight A's and they pretended they were confident in me the whole time.

By far the most upsetting thing for me is that there is no conversation between us at all. I keep my social and my home life poles apart, I don't talk about relationships, friendships, jokes, music, even what we did at school. they've made it very clear that they are my parents and not my friends and then expect me to share stuff with them. Something that sticks in my head is the time that my mum told me that she would disown me if she ever caught me doing drugs. Now whilst I am a good kid, I'm not a straight edge. The first time they caught me drinking (legal age is 18 here but most kids start at 15 or sometimes younger) they were livid and wouldn't talk to me for a week so it gives me all the more reason to separate my social life where we drink all the time and smoke weed etc... The funny thing is it hasn't discouraged me at all from trying stuff out and I still think it would have been far more effective if they sat me down and talked to me about the dangers like my friends parents had.

Now on to my anger. The constant arguing has led to me having a very short temper and whilst I can control my self up to a point the best way I could is like a water balloon being filled slowly until it bursts. This is a very short outburst of anger where I lash out at something (never people.) I have broken a desk, my dads rear view mirror in his car, a couple of plates and a balustrade from the banister. I always regret this afterwards and it upsets me because I am not a violent person but I feel like I am pushed to this point. My parents make no effort to remove me from the situation, de-escalate things or try control their own yelling and anger. So, I have found a couple of ways to reduce my anger eg. playing the drums, going for a walk etc.. However there are some situations that I cant detach myself from and I end up breaking something. My parents suggested therapy at one point but I feel that unless their going to try to help me there is not point in wasting my time.

I don't hate my parents and they can be very supportive and loving but I feel like our relationship is slipping away. I need them to realise that in less than a year I will be an adult and that they need to start respecting me and my opinion like they would do a friend and start making that transition otherwise I can see our relationship completely falling apart as I move away from home.

Do I need therapy for my anger or do you guys thing that I'm being unreasonable.

Cheers

"I grew up in an abusive household. My dad bullied me and did things that would make me angry. I bottled my emotions inside me and they would only come out when I played soccer. All of the rage I felt would be expressed towards my teammates, parents watching the game, and the referee. I felt terribly guilty for it. I said many hurtful things to people. So I learned to bottle my emotions up even more. I tried to be as nice as non-confrontational as possible. Since 16, I had been like that. Everyone walked all over me. I felt like a shadow.

Now I am learning that it is ok to be angry as long as I express it healthily. I am learning to embrace that part of myself that I kept locked away for so long. I see many posts on here saying to “get rid” of the anger, but I disagree with those. Anger is there to protect me, and it is a weapon to be used wisely. It keeps me from being bullied and attacked, but has the potential to let me do the same. I’ve been working with it for almost a year now and have learned a lot. ",1
"Long story short, I was at a bar eating tonight and some piece of work wanted to fight me for whatever reason.  The guy was probably drunk or had some personal issues.  I didn't respond to any of his comments and just walked up and went on my way.  I thought for a few seconds if I should react to him, but my discipline got the better of me, which is great.  It may sound stupid and petty to others, but it felt like a victory for me to be able make a good decision and not cave into my anger and insecurities.

I know I sound condescending to anyone on here seeking help, but just remember that it only takes a few seconds to ruin your life and credibility.  I'm getting better with controlling my impulses, although it isn't easy, especially when it comes to belligerent strangers.

Anyway, I only wanted to share this story.  Stay safe, and keep your cool!",1
"I was playing Overwatch competitive and everybody got a bit tilted and sort of assholish towards each other. However, it calmed down for a bit until this one woman started to behave in a very toxic manner. She chastised everyone for playing bad (according to her), complained pessimistically, and was generally rude. When we lost she blamed the DPS (me) for not doing enough damage.

So I was already a bit miffed by my own performance and the negative attitudes of her and some other teammates, but she exacerbated it. I had and I basically cursed her out and said some disgusting sexist shit. I feel absolutely awful about it. I'm considering taking a break from competitive overwatch because I've been in many toxic game. Finally, it seems like the toxicity is ""spreading.""",1
"Hi there. Just found this sub and thought I would share my story of how I for the most part beat my rage, and became a better person. 

From as far back as I remember I had this ""beast"" inside me. My father was abusive and angry as well, so I guess I learned this behavior from his as a small child.  

When I was in primary school and highschool, I constantly was bullied. I had no way of dealing with the pain and embarrassment and self hate this generated, so i bottled it up. Until some unfortunate classmate of mine or friend or teacher said the wrong thing at the wrong time and I would lash out. 

I remember being in 7th grade. My bottle was full of self loathing and hatred for the people who bullied me. My teacher in class noticed that I was having trouble and asked me what was wrong. when I wouldn't answer her, she grabbed my shoulder. That physical contact was the trigger that set off the explosion. I threw my texbook at her head, tripped her and pushed over my desk on her. I then proceeded to basically tear the entire classroom apart for about 15 minutes, overturning desks and throwing punches kicks and items at people until the teacher finally found a way to restrain me.

This is just one example of many. In this state it was like my conciouness was removed from my body and I was watching myself from behind this wall of rage and hatred. in this state i had no control, and no morals. I didnt care about the people in my way, just that I wanted to inflict as much harm as I possibly could on them until my rage was spent.

I was constantly suspended, sent to the principals office and was constantly refered to many different psychiatrists and therapists. None helped me. 

As I hit puberty and grew, the incidents became more serious. 
I remember a bully who triggered me in 10th grade so I tackled him to the ground in rage. I scratched and clawed at his face until my finger nails were bloody. I pulled his lip ring through his lip, and kicked him repeatedly in the balls. he was in the hospital for 3 days.

I remember another time a few people were lying in the grass while i was walking by, seething from an earlier bullying incident. I could hear them laughing and talking about me. One said ""what a fag"". I snapped, ran over to him and kicked him in the side of the head like a soccer ball. he was knocked out cold and had a pretty severe concussion after that. 

Obviously, this perpetuated a vicious cycle. People would bully me for my obvious awkward nature, and then I would bottle up my emotions until I snapped. which then lead to people bullying me for being insane. Rinse and repeat. at one point in highschool i was haivng about one outburst a month. The school was discussing my future with my parents almost constantly. It was only thanks to my phycologist and a few teachers who understood my predicament that I was allowed to continue, along with the fact that I was an A student.

My road to redemption started sometime around grade 9, when I discovered that there was a grand piano at my highschool that was open for anyone to play at any time. I had never touched a musical instrument in my life at that point. 

As I had no friends, and was always a good student and finished my work as soon as I got it, I had a lot of free time. So I started to spend hours at the Piano. At first it was absolute garbage music. I didn't even know what i was doing. But over 4 years I got better and better. I started playing 8 hours a day. I fed my soul and my hatred and my loathing into the piano. I composed original songs and over 4 years, somehow the music I played gave me the release I had been craving for my entire life. I finally found a way to empty my bottle without it being a disaster. I found a creative release and eventually began to heal my soul. 

It was still a rough road. I still lashed out. I continued to have outbursts until i was in 2nd year university, at 21, but they came less frequently and less intensely. I found a friend in university who took me as I was and helped me through unpacking the abuse my father had gave me as a child. 

I still had work to do though. I knew it. So i booked a ticket to New Zealand, got a work visa and took off into the world, leaving my shitty acting degree in the dust. 

In New Zealand as a 22 year old, I found my freedom and myself. I know its cheesy, but when no one knows your past, your history of self destruction and just takes you as you are, life suddenly becomes a lot easier. while in NZ I became the person I always wanted to be. I found love, real love for the first time, and I smiled more than I ever had in my entire life. In my 1 year there I didnt punch a single wall, or a person for that matter. I finally had found my peace.

Coming home was rough. the people you have at home don't know this new person, and all the prejudice from before your travels is still there. they don't see the changes. And so I found myself fighting my rage again. 

but this time I won. Though I could not get rid of it completely, through music, and a lot of yoga, i found my way forwards. 

My rage is something i still live with today. Its still this little ball of heat in behind my stomach. I still get hot under the collar, but I haven't had an ""episode"" in 6 years. Id like to say Im free of it but 
I have had some very close calls where i had to excuse myself to go and find a piano. I know now that I am on the other side now and I can see the way forwards. I am in control now.  

I also know I am lucky. I was on a path of self destruction that could have ended up with me in jail or worse. I am so thankful for music. It literally saved my life and changed me into a functioning person. 

To all of you out there who are struggling to deal with your rage, know that if you find an outlet- whether this be sports, art, music or whatever floats your boat it can help ALOT. You can find your way forwards. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Travel, remove yourself from toxic environments and you will find a way forwards. 

to quote a great man, Red Green:

Keep your stick on the ice. :)

TL;DR: Was a pretty crazy child/teenager. Regularly exploded and beat the living shit out of people bullying me. Found music, Travel, and over many years let music heal my soul and give me an outlet for my rage. Travelling gave me the way to find out who I was without the rage and prejudice associated with it. Today I am free of outbursts.",1
"Long painful past history. My mom was an alcoholic and coded in the ER and I did CPR with a doctor (I was a firefighter) and got her back. Turns out she had a heart condition she was given a pacemaker type vest for. I didn’t know about the vest as she turned shitty after a few days in the hospital, she said really mean and hateful things like usual and it ended with me saying I won’t come to your funeral. After time passed we talked very rarely and casually. She called me 2/14/2016 and I sent it to voicemail while I was at work. My mom died on 2/15. I handled the services etc. as my dad was too distraught. I feel tremendous guilt for not picking up the phone and haven’t told anyone about it, recently my father revealed in a chat that she had a vest that operated like a pacemaker. In a later conversation it came out she didn’t wear it at home after like the first few days. I kept cool and didn’t reveal how upset I was. The vest would have saved her life- she died from the exact thing she had the vest for. I have so much overwhelming anger. Rage. Why did she not fucking wear it. My son barely remembers her and she loved him so much but not enough to wear it. I hate her for it. She was only 56.  How do I release this anger I have for her bringing death upon herself in such a preventable way?",1

"DAE almost, in a really odd way, enjoy fits of anger? Like I really worry about being destructive and all but it kind of feels good to have my negative emotions fixated on something and letting it out, even if the coping mechanisms are unhealthy 🤔",1
" 

I don’t know what sparked this personality in me. I always thought it might have been my broken family life as a child. Your brain is shaped by your environment around you, right? My mom was very emotionally unstable. She would scream at me and my brother constantly. She’d scream directly into my ear for God knows how long while crying hysterically, then go to her room, slam the door and cry in her bed for an hour or 2. She was fucking crazy. 

And when I had anger issues, she dragged me to therapy for many many years. She never realized she needed it herself and that she was the problem. 

I turned to going after people, blackmailing, threatening, DDoSing, Doxing and more. My brother turned to drugs to cope. We were both messed up as kids. He died 2 weeks ago. The drugs finally got to him just because of our fucking mother.  

This isn’t something we could just get over. It’s scarred us for so long. But I also wonder if I’m just crazy because I hide away in my room. I’ve learned to hate the world. I’ve learned to channel that hate onto anyone that doesn’t like me. I need approval maybe. I don’t know. All I know is I do this shit and I don’t like it.  
 

I’ve noticed lately that I’ve really begun to derive pleasure from emotionally hurting others. Going after them. The people they care about all for revenge. When someone hurts me, I have to hurt them back in the saddest attempt ever by trolling them relentlessly. I need people to see I’m sensitive, insane and maybe if I threaten them enough, they’ll finally talk to me. It’s a strategy I’ve used many times and it sometimes works.  
 I don’t like when people don’t like me so much I’m willing to make shit worse just so maybe they’ll be forced to talk to me. That’s a psychopathic tenancy.   
 

Maybe I think I’m just like every other scumbag guy. The ones that cheat on his wife/girlfriend, gaslight them, make excuses to what happened, then beg for their forgiveness and try to get them to think they won’t do it again and they’re sorry. But they’re not. They just want to suck that person back in with their manipulation. What if that’s me? 

Knowing that I’ve ruined someone’s Twitch show.Knowing I’ve disturbed a Discord server and everything of that like…..I like it. When the attention is on me. I have this sick need to have the focus on me. I’m very self-centred and selfish. The second someone disagrees with me I have to go off on them. I get as much info, keep any pictures I’m given and any information they’ve trusted me with is fodder for blackmail. I see all of that as leverage in case they are to fuck me over. I say to myself that I care about my friends, but I’m easy to go to that lengths if I’m hurt. I can’t trust anyone. Everyone always eventually bans me from their shows and wants nothing to do with me. There is no permanency in life. Everyone I love fucks me over and we all die. I always have to get in the “I’m glad your dad is dead” or “Fucking get cancer and die” or “Kill yourself”. Because I am a sensitive childish asshole and I don’t know how to act like an adult.   
 

But knowing I’ve ruined someone’s day just because of some stupid minute reason I make them feel that way, it fills me with joy. I cause so much shit and it’s all my fault, yet I blame others for my actions because there’s always 2 sides to every story, and I always have to point the finger. So seeing someone cry and stop their show….it means I’ve won. I care more about that than having a friend. 

I always have to get my way, otherwise I keep this immature shit going. “Either listen to what I say or I will do this thing to you. I will not allow you to ban me/ stop being my friend” etc. I’m manipulative and have the mindset if you’re feared, then you’re respected. I don’t want this. I want to be better. I don’t wanna be like my brother was before he died. 

 What is wrong with me? Am I an emotional-psychopath, sociopath or sadist? How can I stop myself? I need help.  ",1
"My relationship has really suffered from my ability to stay calm during a disagreement with my SO.  Recently after a screaming match I had a heart to heart with them and realized that I needed to get help.

"Husband seems to always be forgetting his keys when we're both outside of the house with no way to get back in. However, we're currently staying at an AirBnB and this is the second time he's locked us out. The dog is screaming and howling inside because he can hear us. The owners are in a different state at the moment, so the owner has to call his sister and get her to leave work to let us back in.. which is an hour wait. An hour of being hungry, bitten by bugs, hearing my dog howl from inside, and having to sit in the car next to him because he never locks the fucking car. I get it, humans make mistakes and I'm trying to not get too upset but I just can't help it. He's the one who primarily drives everywhere in general and he's the only one who can drive the rental car. I attached all the keys together to lessen the chance of loss. I reminded him multiple times to make sure he's ready before we walk out the door and as soon as the fucking door closes and locks us out, he makes a stupid ""oh no"" face. 

I don't want to come off as a bitch but I'm 6-months pregnant and the second time is a fuck ton less fun than the first time. All he can do is just sit there and mindlessly play his stupid mobile game. I want to fucking explode but I know I shouldn't be as angry over a mistake as I am. ",1
"10 days off. Day one, I'm livid already.

So last September as an irma refugee me and my fiance came to hang out with my parents for a month or so. They wanted us to stay, I decided to head back to Florida after being away for several months due to the hurricane.  I left expensive camping gear among other things at the house, me and the finance planned on moving back to be closer to the family.  A year later im still in Florida.

Bur I came up for a visit this week and several hours off the plane I'm fucking irate to find out that all of my shit is gone.  Most notably expensive camping gear that I worked hard to afford.  I searched the house high and low, either my brother's family just stole the shit, or my sisters family because it sure as shit isn't in the house and nobody else would have been here.

The thing that makes me even angrier is that my family insists that they had never seen it at the house.  Which is funny because I found an expensive ass tent tucked away in the corner that they didn't remember me having either.  My finance remembers clear as day where we left ir, and even reminded me to bring it back for an upcoming camping trip.

I'm beyond pissed.  I don't know who stole it but blood or not whoever it is can get fucked.  Nobody is owning up to it.  8 more days here and I'm so pissed I don't even want to talk to anyone.

Am I wrong here?

Edit: worse yet my phone keeps showing me camping supplie because is listening to my conversations and showing me ads.  Which is something that pisses me off in general but due to the circumstances essentially makes me want to go genocidal on the tech industry. ",1
"I’m a 23y/o man who is usually calm and peaceful (thanks to many years of counseling) and it takes a lot to set me off. But these past three days I have been becoming so angry out of the blue, that I begin to shake with rage. Like I said I have many years of anger counseling but it’s been years since I have been this mad. I have been trying everything I can to calm down. Since it’s such an estranged feeling (after all the years of being calm and collected) when I get this shaking anger I get a bust of adrenaline and I can’t stop the anger feeling it the internal rage to take my anger out on an inanimate object, or the next person that is out of line. Please any advice would be great links that could point me in some sort of direction would be amazing! I’m just worried it’s going to revert to the old stages where I get so mad I black out!",1
"I contacted the appointed counsellor but he does not wish to discuss my reason for being angry.

"Of late, I get furious when I listen to day to day sounds which feel like nails on a blackboard to me. For instance, at home I get bugged/ irritated when I hear somebody coughing or my mom throwing utensils (she vents out by putting down utensils noisily when she is angry). At the workplace, I'm easily irked by a loud ringtone or someone's booming voice. How do I specifically learn to tune out/ stop reacting to this? I said not have this problem before since I used to listen to music on my headphones most of the time, but I can't keep that up forever, and there's only a limit to which supervisors will tolerate me tuning myself out at the workplace.

Before when I would get mad I would have an absolute rage fit and feel bad about it later and then kind of move on. Now I feel like my anger is actually starting to affect my health. I got really mad tonight (slamming doors, yelling, cursing) the whole nine yards and my vision feels blurry, I have a pounding headache, and I can’t sleep.

Title says it all!,1
"I have the worst anger ever and I’m so sick of it. My fiancé and I argue constantly and I’m ruining my relationship more every day. I don’t even know where to begin to explain but I go from 0 to 100 real quick and I basically have angry/negative thoughts all the time and can not stop them no matter what like how do I block them out??? 

I’ve been getting slightly better with it around my fiancé... he has anger issue too but has control over them. Problem is that his methods do NOT work for me. He’s all about that toxic positivity shit... “oh just smile and be happy”...... “just don’t be angry just ignore it it’s unproductive and bad” like he says that shit as if it’s supposed to just magically fix everything. Like all that shit works for him and that’s great but it doesn’t work for me. I believe it’s unhealthy to just ignore it and it needs to be expressed in a healthy way. He doesn’t believe there is ANY healthy way to express anger and that it’s completely healthy and possible to just hold the feelings in and that’ll make them go away. We argue about it constantly. And it’s to a point where he’s like triggered whenever I’m slightly upset. 

We just had an argument (still currently are) because I expressed EVER SO SLIGHT annoyance at something... all I said was “why is he gonna call and then not answer when you call back” in a completely normal, calm although a little irritated, voice, and he’s like “it’s fine just STOP JUST STOP” like yelling at me and I’m like dude wtf and he’s like “I could tell you were getting mad” and whatever and then THATS what actually did make me mad and we had a whole blowout argument, but he’s claiming that I sounded like I always did when I was about to get mad, and I explained that i WASNT and I was just trying to express it like a normal person, but he claims that’s bullshit bc I ended up getting mad anyway... and I explain to him that the reason I’m mad is because he overreacted and I genuinely wasn’t going to have an angry freak out but I was just trying to express normal annoyed thoughts like anyone else... and he’s like “well how should I know because whenever you do that it does turn into an angry freak out” and he’s not exactly wrong but shit just always ends up happening and I get mad anyway and like I just can’t fucking help it. 

And then he’s like “I just don’t like when you get angry and I don’t like when you express it by yelling and saying horrible shit” which is what I usually do. But the thing is in this situation, 3 months ago in this situation I would’ve blown up immediately and started saying evil, violent, horribly mean shit about whoever I was mad at, so I understand why he would be on edge. He has every right to feel on edge when I start getting upset. But this time, I was calm; I didn’t raise my voice, and I didn’t say anything horrible or mean about anyone - just a little like “ugh why isn’t he picking up the phone” and like even though I wanted to be nastier, I wasn’t, so like I feel proud of myself, and then he gets triggered and yells at me to “prevent a freak out” but that just CAUSED the freak out. And when I say that he’s just like “oh I’ll never react the right way” or whatever self pity... he’s not perfect either but better than me at controlling and managing his anger.

Idk where I’m going with this now But I want to just stop being like this and stop being like this. How do I express my anger in a way that actually works and doesn’t upset my fiancé? Inb4 meditation I have severe add and cannot meditate... also whenever I do that I just end up thinking about angry negative shit 😔

Edit: holy shit I didn’t realize how long that was I’m sorry. TLDR I’m a dumb idiot angry cunt that need to stop feeling emotions",1
"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this on.

I am guilty of blowing things out of proportion. So  for example I will go on for hours bickering after my husband has done something I dont like or agree with. I only bicker because  I suffer with anxiety and feel like he doesnt do anything to change.

After hours of bickering he gets frustrated and angry and blows up at me and brings up things I have done wrong etc. He knows his frustration only heightens my anxiety but he says he cant help it. I am of the belief that bickering is harmless compared to uncontrollable anger and that no matter what he should stay calm for my sake and to be mindful of what he is doing. Because bickering and frustration has got us both nowhere in the past yet we both repeat the same vicious pattern. Is my husband just making an excuse or is it really that he cant help it?",1

"Hello Reddit!

I'm writing to you because of the huge relationship trouble my anger an lack of emotional control is often causing.

The truth is that I'm constantly afraid of being criticized by my S.O. about something that I haven't done correctly.

I know he means well and he is not condescending at all about his remarks. **It's just that I seem to be so stressed that I can already anticipate that I did something wrong**... and when this prediction comes true, I sort of lose the ability of controlling my expressions or my voice.

For example, I often do mistakes in the kitchen and, while I'm cooking, my subconscious seems to be thinking ""please, don't let there be something wrong with what I did. Please..."". That is when I start to become tense and anxious and, finally, if something was wrong I sort of snap when it is mentioned. Even if it was with the best of intentions.

Is there any way to manage these outbursts? Is there any way to feel more relaxed? More chill?
It's really no fun to always being afraid and anxious of having done some mistake, even if the fix is quick and easy. Often the outburst causes more trouble than the original mistake.

Thank you for your advice! I really hope I can improve this part of myself.",1

"I am having a serious issue--normal for anger I guess, but it's really scaring me.  With certain daily triggers I become the devil.  This state has gotten worse over time, not better, despite my attempts to be sympathetic and understanding of the triggers.  I go from 0-100 so fast that I don't have time to respond/control myself.  Just thinking about the triggers makes me turn into this guy.  I am concerned I will seriously hurt someone.  I do believe that we are victims of our own programming, that through brut force habits of resisting the initial reactions we can change into that ""fake nice guy"" we initially pretend to be, over time, but this case is different--I don't have control; it happens to fast.  It's too strong, too big of an entity inside of me--alternate me--devil me.  I feel like I am just playing games with myself, not giving myself the liberty of taking control by simply believing that I still can control this guy--he takes the wheel the second I even think of him to try and control him.  HE has control when I'm even slightly agitated.  I feel like I am waiting for him to hurt someone I love, as if there is release or some sort of freedom in hitting rock bottom.  I don't want to hurt anyone.  This condition is only getting worse and I don't know what effective methods could help me.  I've tried meditation (doesn't do shit), reading about anger control (then what?), but basically I know myself, and I know that I need something that's going to give immediate feedback (even if negligible) or I'll just give up.

"I have recently been experiencing some of the most difficult boughs of anger that i have ever experienced. They're almost downright hallucinogenic at points. My teeth begin to scream at me, begging me to dig them into another person's neck and ""rip their fucking throats out."" A while ago, I was out running with my fiancee and I started to become inexplicably enraged. I just wanted to calm down and make it go away, but it consumed me. I wanted to hurt someone. To maim. I started to hear the power lines buzzing intensely and i looked up to see a burning red sky filled with hostility and began to weep. I ended up punching myself over and over and gave myself a black eye. I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety, but I've never been an overtly angry person. My father is the angry one. I want to become a social worker and help people, so these outbursts have been extremely disturbing to me. There's a demon inside of my head that wants to rip people limb from limb for absolutely no reason, and when i don't, it claws at my skull in petulant anger. I have been extremely irritable and have been rude as hell to my fiancee on several occasions as of recent, and that really bothers me. I love her with all my heart, I don't want to make her feel bad. I feel the swift pain of regret instantly after my mistake and apologize, but the hurt that she feels is still real despite my apologies. It kills me. I feel like Jack from The Shining and i relate to the character far more than i would like to admit. It terrifies me. What can I do? Ive been in therapy for 7 years, and I still don't understand it.

"I struggle with explosive anger. I've spent years in CBT, and have gotten much better. I don't break things anymore, but I still go from 0-60 in a matter of seconds, yelling and cursing and verbally assaulting. I nearly lost my job last week based on one of my outbursts.

I have a tough time noticing my anger before it boils over. I did an experiment this week when I got an email that triggered me. I started a stopwatch on my phone. I waited until my anger/heart rate was back to normal and checked the stopwatch at around 20 mins.

I had this idea to track my anger triggers using a Fitbit, hoping the heart rate monitor could give me insight to my physical state and keep me from doing or saying something I regret before my physical fight response has run it's course.

Anyone try this? I'm not sure quite how it would work, but if you could set an alert or vibration for when your heart rate becomes accelerated, perhaps that would help one to start becoming aware of anger BEFORE it boils over and you end up with seemingly out-of-the-blue rage.

Just a thought.",1
"Long question. See tl;dr at the bottom if you don't want to read the whole thing. 

My fiance occasionally has anger outbursts which make me worried. 

The first time I witnessed it, he got out of his car and screamed at someone else. I told him I didn't like it and I was very disappointed to see this side of him.

Another time, I made him eggs in a way he didn't like them. He screamed at me for 5 minutes  about not being able to learn/doing it wrong on purpose. He tried to teach me patiently (unsuccessfully) many times before, and I guess that day something snapped in him. This was his worst outburst and it happened a year ago. It took him an hour to apologise and to understand my point that he should never shout like that, even if for some reason I did do it on purpose. He admitted to me that he had a problem that day, and said that he's working on it. 

I told him that I will never stand for him shouting at me. Even if he talks about other things that bothered him at work, if he starts raising his voice, I tell him to stop and calm down. He usually looks surprised at first, but then he takes a few deep breaths and he does calm down. 

Yesterday, we were on a video call and my mum could hear him. The call started lagging, and he started getting irritated. 

Him: stop talking it's lagging 

Me: ok *not talking*

Him (more irritated, keeps repeating himself): stop talking I can't hear you!

Me (realising he's hearing something from 2 minutes ago): calm down sweetie, I know 

Him (screaming now): SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!!!!! *hangs up *

My mum heard that conversation and got scared. She never heard him shouting before. She's worried he'd get violent with me in the future. 

He's 29 and knows he has a problem. He thinks he can work on it, and shows signs of doing so. His anger outbursts happen every few months, but we don't live together. Apart from that he's amazing, caring and extremely self aware. He's never thrown anything/showed signs of wanting to physically hurt me. He's great with kids and his nieces and nephews love him.

Do you think my mum is right and he could get more violent in the future? Does anger get worse with age? Does the fact that he acknowledges his problem necessarily mean that he'll improve?

Tl;dr: fiance has screaming outbursts every few months. Apart from that he's the perfect partner, and is aware of his problem.  Should I be worried about future abuse?",1
"3 days ago I had one of the biggest outbursts of my anger problem in years and it almost cost me a friendship with one of my closest friends who I've known for about 7 years now. I am a very high professional achiever but I am very insecure when it comes to personal relationships especially with those who matter most to me for reasons stemming from various things in childhood and previous poor relationships which manifests into outbursts of extreme anger and verbal abuse. I travelled to another continent to see this person after almost a year of not being able to see them.

She was excited about a job interview that went well and in the moment she forgot we had plans and planned to do something with her boyfriend instead. This started the spiral, even though she tried to make it right by saying we could still do the thing later that day I shot that down because I was being a child. When she got back from seeing her boyfriend I was already acting up and decided to go for a run to try and calm down to not cause this exact situation. Before I left I told her I was having issues so I needed to go for a little bit and that we would have a conversation about it when I got back. When I got back she said we need to talk and asked me to go to a hotel as it had made her uncomfortable. I believe she believed it was related to having feelings for her, we had previously dated some years prior for a few months when we first met which I ended because of a bad situation between us but we have had moments like this since but not quite as bad where the friendship went on hold for a few months when I did have feelings still so I can see how she could think that.

I have been single our breakup but I do not have romantic feelings for her any-more I have just had a few rough years since then and between my anger issues and bouts of being in mentally bad shape I just haven't dated. I haven't been ready for it and I don't want to put someone in front of my issues.

When she asked me to go to the hotel I immediately felt like I was being dumped out in the cold even though she said she was trying to take into account my feelings. I tried to calmly explain that it was in part because I am jealous that she has been able to find a stable relationship when I have had issues and partly because I felt slighted from earlier and I was trying to explain that to her in a way that she would understand because I already felt guilty about feeling that way but it didn't change her mind about the hotel. At that point I didn't black out or anything but I went off and my mouth kept running for what seemed like another hour saying some very rough things and at one point she asked me to get out of her apartment but ultimately I did not. We came to a ""compromise"" but that's bullshit because she was definitely hurt and just wanted it to stop. Later on she went to get a drink with her boyfriend who she then brought back with her who was clearly uncomfortable that I was there which she had told me stemmed from the fact he was worried for her. I don't think she went into details with him because otherwise I think he would have attempted to have words with me instead of eating dinner with me. Ultimately after calming a bit I agreed and went to the hotel the next day.

I spent the part of that night when she left to get drinks with her boyfriend sobbing and shaking and I spent the following day  after I got to the hotel doing much of the same worried about the friendship I was pretty certain I had just destroyed. Luckily for me she clearly cares about me because we're still talking as of now although she said it'll take time to rebuild her trust which is understandable. I hadn't taken her feelings into account and she had tried hard to make the first two days I was here with her fun for both of us and now I haven't seen her nearely as much as I would prefer and from what she said to me in the moment this didn't go the way she had planned at all either. All in all have felt pretty shit and think my own emotional outbursts are ridiculous as well. I had a call with my therapist stressing that this was a defcon 1 situation for me and that getting to the bottom of this is now my top priority for my self improvement. I don't want to hurt any one like that much less someone I care very very much about.

Sorry for the wall of text but I needed to type it out it lets me go over it again and I figured this was a good place for that.",1
"To make this short. My dad has an extreme anger problem. The moment he comes home from work he immediately finds something to start arguing about. He will **intentionally** try to entice a fight with you if you make him mad by getting in your face and saying ""what do you wanna do, do you want to make this physical??"" And you can't joke around with him because he takes things too seriously.

I can go on and on about his anger problems. But whenever I try to confront him about his problem he immediately puts the blame on me by saying I made him mad and it's my fault. I will admit sometimes he makes me mad and I do cause some problems. But you have to understand how hard it is to have to control your own emotions when you have a person *spitting* and yelling directly in your face. And to add to this, he sometimes even intentionally says things like ""We need to hate each other so that you get out of my house."" Threatening to kick me out at times over simple arguments that get out of control.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I loathe when he comes home and sometimes wish he wouldn't. Can anyone please help me with this? I've been dealing with this for years but lately he's been getting worse for some reason.

"I've nearly gotten myself in bad trouble more than once with road rage. There's one technique that has sometimes helped me, so I wanted to share it.

If I catch myself starting to get mad on the road…  (and I know that's the hard part, catching oneself *before* overreacting)... I start doing simple math in my head.  I'll add together the digits of a nearby license plate, or the digits of a speed limit sign, or any random numbers.   I keep adding up different numbers for a few minutes.

It seems to pull me into the more rational, logic-oriented part of the brain and away from pure emotion.  (And it engages the brain more than the fabled “count to ten” approach.)  So it has worked sometimes.   

(The times it doesn't work are when I'm “already too mad to care whether I'm mad” because I didn't catch myself soon enough.  I think a lot of us have been there. Still working on that...but not giving up!)",1

"Growing up I didn't have much of really any support from my parents, and dealt with a lot of emotional abuse. A lot of gaslighting and being the blame for anything everything that could go wrong. I could never really form a relationship with either of my real parents as for a while I hated them just as much I hated my actual abuser. I wanted to have a family that could have dinner at a table instead of me just running straight to my room and locking the door every night. Every day felt like it was cheating me out of some semblance of normalcy that others around me had. I hated them for having things I didn't. At this point any time I had an arguement with anyone it would be the focal point of my week and every day was a new arguement about anything at home.  This went on for about 15 years until I moved out a few years ago. I'm 26 now and my morning routine is often now wak il ng at 4:30am to take a shower and ponder about how I wish god would just fucking wipe me out of existence already, not just kill me but completely wipe my dna off the grid, so this leads to me hating something that doesn't even really exist. Deep down I just want something to be held accountable for the shitty existence that billions of directionless lifeforms like myself, I wanted my parents to say they're sorry. I wanted god to fix his shitty mistakes and give me my pancreas back. I keep holding answerless grudges that will never be resolved and I honestly have no idea what the fuck I'm even doing. How do you get rid of that? I don't want to live like this. I'm tired and I can't sleep. If you made it this far. I'm actually pretty sorry and I hope you're doing okay on your end too.",1
"I'd been dating this guy and things ended last night. Things had been weird the last week or so and I told him that if he didn't have space for me in his life right now that was fine but I needed him to just say it. He couldn't give me a straight answer. I lost my fucking mind, marbles and manners entirely and said some really nasty things to him. I mean I said things that took my own self by surprise so i can't even imagine how he felt. i feel especially bad because i did this knowing that he was already feeling down. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I apologized and told him that although what he did to me (there's more context) was unacceptable he didn't deserve to be put down like that. I wished him well and told him i hope he enjoys his life. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning im feeling the anger hangover. I feel sad that I still haven't been able to get it under control. I'm once again question whether or not i'm actually a good person or not. I mean good people don't say the things I did. I was drunk and im far worse when im drunk. I know better and i keep making the same mistakes. I'm pissed off at myself because I gave him a reason to feel justified. I just. This has to stop and i don't know how to.",1
 A problem ive been having again recently is dying/losing in a shooting game. I go from complaining about dying to yelling to screaming and finally ill just start breaking shit. Ive started taking a water bottle outside and just throwing in my backyard until it explodes. But that doeant solve the problem. Any ideas or tips on dealing with this anger?,1
So me and my best friend were playing this game I realllyyy like then one day he bought the most boring game alive but unlucky for me he likes i didnt care cause playing with him is better than not playing but then he plays the game i like with his sister and why i ask him why her not him and if he wants to play with her why not all of us he said cause i dont wanna play with you that really annoys me not cause he doesnt wanna play because he owed me a game but suddenly said no and didnt wanna play now hes just being a dick all together like atleast say it in a more caring way like seriously weve been playing that game for years and never ran out of fun and he buys this boring ass game and i play it with him every day and now he suddenly doesnt wanna play with me cause just no reason in the new game its sooooo boring its just one thing over and over (im not saying the name cause i dont wanna cause trouble) like weve been playing since 2nd grade now when he finally plays the game i wanna play he doesnt wanna play meanwhile when i say i dont wanna play hes like WHAT THE FUCK EVERYYYYDAY YOU DO THIS how do i not care cause if i didnt care this wouldnt be a problem in the first place,1
"I'm unable to hide my anger, and I'm always on the wrong because of it. 

I never had a problem with anger growing up until my early 20s. I stated relationship and to this day, love her to death but the relationship isn't perfect. I noticed myself getting more angry at the point where it was now an issue. Its all I could feel and caused more issues. 2 years now ive been working past it and very very slowly but surely its declining gradually. 

So I'm a 25/m working at a chinese restaurant. A new coworker started and seems cool and a good fit. Everyone at my job already knows I can get angry (crappy situation) sometimes but they seem to be a little understanding after being there a year. They know I work on it daily. Any way i forgot his name but the coworker came up to me and called me a girl name instead of my actual name. He was laughing but didn't seem like a joke to get me go laugh with him. It just triggered me and havent been able to shake it off a couple hours now. Any advice? Feels like I'm going back on a lot of progress ive made",1
"Ever since the past year where I started dealing with depression and sucide thoughts I started feeling pent up and very angry. Not at anyone but at myself. Whenever I make a small mistake I feel so angry at myself to the point where I would feel worthless. I dealt with abuse in the past and it broke me mentally. I feel so angry the entire time and feel like one day I will snap and do something I will regret. Recently my anger also extended to other people where I can hold grudges and never forget about what they did to me. When im alone in my room I feel so angry and sad at the same time openly.


If I'm overreacting please let me know because I think I am. Please help me I don't know how long I can last dealing with this.",1
"So exactly a month ago, I saw a post on r/All that directed me to this sub - and what I have learnt has helped with my outbursts of rage.

I would get so angry I have physically destroyed (my own) property on numerous occasions. My turning point was getting involved in a shouting match after road rage on my part - and the guy got so angry he almost came after me. I realized I have issues when the smallest things would drive me to hurling things across the room.

So what I have learnt - and hoping to help someone out as well:

* you have to identify the triggers. How do you feel when you're just about to blow up? Those feelings - when they start coming, practice mindfulness, and self-talk to actualize/realize that you're sliding down that slippery rage/anger slope. Time to stop, count to 3 - and reassess. ***9 times out of 10 this helped me not throw a plate across the room.***
* pin-pointing the real reason you blow up: for me, i would get especially angry when people cut me off while driving,  don't listen to my opinion (or i tell someone something really cool, then days later they tell me about it and I'm there like, ""seriously? you know i'm the one who told you that). When my SO didn't do the dishes after promising he would.

So the 2nd one I'm still struggling with - because I had to face up to my own ugly soul - why do I feel so entitled about stuff that actually doesn't matter? Still need to do a lot more soul searching, but i'm glad to announce that it's been 4 weeks of not breaking anything, not banging anything, general peace.So to all you guys - thanks for sharing the tips and techniques. I'm a work in progress.",1
"I’m usually a calm person, but I always have these moments where I just bark. A few months ago I broke the wall in one of my episodes and my family won’t let me live it down, but every time they make a joke or comment or anything about it, it also makes me so angry and I just snap at them. I can’t keep my volume in check. When I’m angry I don’t care where we are or when or anything I just yell and raise my voice. Anyone know how to keep your volume at a low at least? I hate the stares after I come to my senses",1
"Maybe it’s there and I missed it.

When I’m angry, which is daily (duh), I try to remember that most things I do aren’t necessary, and if I’m in a bad space, it’s better to take a break, a nap if I can, or just kinda stop what I’m doing, or disconnect from thinking.

Essentially, doing nothing is better than doing something if I’m adding a negative value. 

Sure, I could wash the dishes and help out, but if I’m pissed about it, and I take it out on someone then or later, it is usually better if I do nothing, take a break. And then, if my meditation/reflection time is successful, I have a sense of gratitude when I do the dishes (or calling my mom, or whatever). 

We are often told that if we do nothing we are lazy or unproductive or selfish, etc, but doing nothing is often the right choice when anger is present. Again, acts done when angry often lead to a negative on the cosmic balance sheet.",1

"

I lost my dad a few years ago and my company did not send through a sympathy wreath to me. While a colleague came to visit me, she and others did so out of a personal obligation. This I am grateful for but didn’t appreciate that there was nothing sent by the company to me while I witnessed others receiving sympathy flowers for every loss of a loved one. This has bugged me for the past few years and I approached my HR Manager to clarify and gain understanding on the oversight. While I accepted her explanation (sorry, it was an oversight on our part) she did not investigate further as to who didn’t do their part to arrange the flowers. I happen to know who this person is and feel really angry whenever I see her. When her Mother died , I went around the office to get people to sign on a sympathy card for her. Her very presence irks me and I am finding it difficult to face her. It has come to a point where I cannot even look at her face. I tell myself that it is time to let go. However, I am struggling with this anger that I feel. I want for her to be counselled and for her to know that I know that she did not arrange this for my dad’s death and that it was a cruel thing to do (I know that she does not like me). I want to have a closure on this and move forward. Any wise words on how I can cope with this anger a little better?",1
"Recently I’ve accepted that I need to work on my anger. I’ve been doing real well. That is until the co worker who nags all day put his target on me. 

  BItching moaning groaning and down right lying. 

Management has done nothing for the last 20 years but tell him to be quiet until he acts up again. Growing up in an abusive home it’s the cycle of when my mom would cross his lines and dad would “correct” her. 

This lead to my ptsd as well as many other Deamons that I face. The past I have recently forgiven and no longer feel ashamed to talk about

However I can’t make him stop and management won’t stop him. So what else is there to do. It’s not even a thing of ignoring him as co workers tell me it all when I goto work and he leaves. I try to ignore it. But the slander is killing me. To the point of me exploding on management. Last time I complained they found a way to spin it on me so I’d keep quiet and I was punished into submission. 

What do u do about the nags. I ignore at work but it eats at me.",1
"I came to college after a not so great time at high school. Didn't really have any friends cause the only way I knew how interact was being the school clown which didn't really roll as well as it did prior to high school. Anyway, college started out with a lot of stress adjusting to the work and some depressing feelings here and there. Led me into some sad/mad, pissy moods. But, sometime later some friends I knew from middle school came to visit me. Probably, the most genuinely happy I've ever been in life. They didn't stick around too long though as they all had their own lives to attend to.  Now, I'll just occasionally see them here and there while going to places in which we'll just exchange some brief greetings. 

Anyway, a couple days ago I realized that I started to like being angry and a bit sad more than I do being happy. It helps me get work done and avoid people bothering me (in most cases) and I'm starting to try and figure what my triggers are. I couldn't do any physical harm even if I wanted to, I'm too unfit to do so. Funny story, I was actually slower than the guy with asthma while I did track in middle school. But seriously, after going to the gym for the first time only to find out that I could barely last 3 minutes on a cycling machine and having the feeling of people shooting their glances at me, I'm never going to exert more energy than I need. I don't like interacting with people, but I'm still interested in what other people do in life—that is as long as it doesn't involve me. Reason why I'm making this post is cause I remembered reading somewhere that craving anger or ""succumbing to it"" is bad for you or something. Probably won't do anything about it until something bad happens though, but I guess I'm just interested in the topic for now.",1
I’m tired of having this hate in my heart for these people that don’t care about me. I have bad depression and some anxiety. I’m tired of hating them but also get so damn angry I want to act on it.

"So I've been really angry lately over really small things. It usually happens when there are people around me and one or two of them are whispering or making noise. This especially happens at school or at home, and I get really angry and say/think really mean things that I would never really say or do. I haven't told my parents or my friends yet, but I think I should. When I'm angry I usually yell or hit myself ( I've made a post on this subreddit about it). I've had a few moments where I have yelled at someone really loudly or hit myself really hard that it made a bruise. I don't mean to do it, but i guess it's just the spur of the moment. I get anxiety over people sliding objects but that doesn't really happen anymore, and I've talked to someone about it. This has been happening since I started high school and it might be due to stress, but I don't know. I'm 13/f if that helps.",1

"Hi all! I'm a 33/m who just lost my job a few weeks back. I ve been trying hard to get a job but have been unsuccessful in it. The anger in me has been there for a while maybe a few years but a few days back I lost it completely! Got drunk pretty bad and abused my wife(5 yrs since marriage) with words which should never be said. She always forgave me for my outbursts but this time she broke down completely. The moment I let out that anger I realised what a collosal blunder I ve done. I cried about that but didn't help. She's almost about to divorce but then both our parents intervened and managed to convince her to not go with the divorce. We have a child of 4 years and I feel that's the only thing which is keeping this relationship alive. I really love her but the  anger outbursts destroy everything that was repaired earlier. Now I'm frustrated cos of this situation that I'm in and also cos of the job that I don't have.

"I have been lurking on this subreddit for over two years in an effort to get better.  I have attempted to work many strategies into my life, but none have worked.  Even after I have made my life multitudes better I still carry around this anger demon.  I feel a bubbling rage inside of me constantly.

I work out 4-5 days a week, I eat well, I sleep well, I'm doing well in school, and yet losing at video games makes me want to put my fist through my screen and jump out the window.  I get so angry I can't see straight, my chest hurts, I get an uncontrollable urge to punch things, and any chance that I can play more is gone.  I have even bitten into my own arm before out of pure anger.  This almost always happens in games like Rocket League where the enemy is being a sore winner alongside beating me.

My friends know how much of a baby I am with games and I feel like it's affecting my relationship with them.  I feel like I have no one to talk to, so maybe this post will do something for me but probably not.

If things aren't going my way or if someone doesn't hear what I say I immediately get angry. It could be from forgetting to buy rice that instantly starts me off. If people are around and I get the feeling like I'm gonna have an outburst I don't deal with that straight away but I would look around at things to hit later when no one's around. 

It's getting to the point where my relationship with family and partner aren't healthy. They are all great but this is putting a huge strain and I feel like I'm pushing them all away.

Hi all. 38m. Recently broke up with a girl after 8 months. She wanted me to move in with her which means moving an hour from where I live. I would have to find a new job and be further from my child which I am willing to do I love her but she was not understanding of the hardship it could create.

"I've never once allowed myself to feel angry. My dad was always so angry and I wanted to be nothing like him at the price of repressing any emotion and convincing myself that anything other than happy was unacceptable and I'd cry it out once I was alone. It gets to be so much sometimes though. I can't focus, I get anxious and start to take out the anger on myself. I've never wanted to be an angry person but reality is I am so easy to set off but I would never show anyone that side of me. I would honestly rather die than ever let myself get angry and take that out on others. But I'm also so tired of taking it out on myself. Honestly whenever I'm in a rage the only thing I can think of doing is hurting myself and until I do I feel completely insane. 

How can I learn to handle these emotions? I get them so often and so intensely and honestly they just scare me. I don't want them but I know I'm stuck with it so what can I honestly do to genuinely get over any anger without taking it out on anyone around me or myself?",1
"My anger is actually directed toward another redditor. I won't mention his username in the interest of abiding by the rules but because of him, I'm actually using a backup account. My main account is under a 3-day suspension, because he's reported me but that's only part of the reason I'm so angry.

A year ago, I responded in another user's thread and the person i was replying to wasn't even the OP or the person this post is about nor did it have anything to do with him. Some time later, the user in question replied to ME, saying something which was completely uncalled for, and as such I fired back at him repeatedly. When he ignored me, I've been PM'ing him harassing messages off and on and he would ignore me, but that's not enough to make me stop. I wanted him to pay for making that offensive post that was so uncalled for. I want revenge. I'd like to think my constant tormenting him is payback enough but i don't know how he's handling it.

"Suddenly I get anger attacks that may last maybe half an hour or even hours. It is annoying. I dont like it to happen but I dont precisely like affection coming from my mother. After she does it, im like willing to destroy something, then I feel deppresive.. Happens since my puberty. Ive never been molested when being a kid or something like that, but ill be honest: id rather get that affection from other people (in the way that other people are allowed to do it, certainly). When she shows me her affection, I feel like she feels im still her baby and I hate that because I feel like thats the way she made me grow, and also its like it has had an uncomfortable effect on my personality.",1
"I have been so angry, for so many years, for so many different reasons, and it's finally starting to catch up with me. I find myself completely crippled with anger. I stopped talking to my family almost ten years ago out of anger, and still have not gotten back in touch with them. I find myself unable to enjoy anything, even things that I used to love doing, like watching horror movies and playing retro games. Everything seems so pointless, including going to therapy. I don't want to be on Zoloft or Xanax or some other zombie pill. I snap on my fiance all the time, no idea why she is even still with me (we are both overweight so she probably thinks she'll never find anyone else, which is exactly what I think about myself as well). I work at home, at nights, doing tech support, so I literally sit at my desk all night, sleep all day, wake up, eat, watch YT videos for hours, and then start working again. Never go out on dates or do anything romantic with my fiance, and honestly I'm even starting to have sexual issues because of the anger. I find myself so pissed off and anxious about whatever is bothering me at that moment that I can't even focus my mind enough to have sex with a woman who loves me and wants me, and who I'm attracted to. I'm just so angry all the time, and the generality and unspecified nature of the anger makes it so much more frustrating. I'm also convinced 99% of the time that my fiance, my friend, my roommates, or my coworkers all hate me, and/or are mad at me about something. I always feel like I did something wrong and that I fuck up everything I touch. I once got so mad that I smashed my fist into the wall and broke two of my knuckles; my hand hurts every day now. Inspired by the Angry Video Game Nerd, I went to college years ago to ""be a filmmaker"" (what a joke) and ended up doing jack shit with it, and anytime I even try to think about filming some stuff for YT, I just end up telling myself that I'm a loser who no one would want to watch anyway, and the idea is done before it starts. I have also tried my hand at recording rap music, but again, every time I record something, I hate it, never let anyone else listen to it, and tell myself I should never do this again because its worthless and horrible, and no one cares about some fat nerd putting his feelings into rhyme form. I think about killing myself on a pretty regular basis because the idea of living this way for another 50 years makes me have a fucking existential crisis and a half. I will never do it, though, only because of my fiance. Everything I do in life is to please others, the only thing I do for myself is eat fast food and jerk off before falling asleep.",1

"Since my first post here nearly 3 weeks ago, when I hit a low and knew I needed to do something, I've been doing a little better. Everyone was so nice and helpful. 

I read that Zoloft helped, and I was already on the lowest dose of that for depression, so I talked to my doctor about increasing it, which I got the go ahead to do. I don't really feel different, but I also haven't had any major outbursts. 

I've been trying to do meditation/yoga/exercise every morning, but I really like to sleep, so I usually shut the alarm off. I went a week straight doing it,  but haven't done it the last two days, and I think I feel a difference.

"Anyone been in a relationship with someone who took a course? Did it work? It seems every argument we have escalates for no reason. I gave birth 4 months ago and my baby is at the point where he is super aware of his surroundings, I dont want him seeing us like that. After one particular incident once everything calmed down the next day I asked if he would do anger management and he agreed if it was online. Does anyone have any good recommendations? I used the search but some of the posts were years old. I feel myself falling apart. I have PTSD and depression from a husband that passed away a few years ago which led to a heroin addiction. I've been clean two years now. Now with the added stress of a baby and a tad of postpartum depression I feel I'm at the end of my rope. Please no dump him comments, he doesnt beat me or anything like that and is actually caring when we are not fighting. We have like 1 or 2 big ones a month but it feels like it lasts forever. It's just that he can't just move on from an argument until hours later when everyone is miserable and I'm begging him to stop. Thanks in advance.",1
"My girlfriend of 6 years was out of state visiting a friend. The morning she was meant to come back home, she told me she’s staying there, because she’s afraid of me. My anger has been really out of hand this last month and a half. She lies to me, a lot, and recently it’s been excessive and hurtful. I ended up slapping her during a particularly bad argument. It’s been eating at me since. I feel ugly inside. I’ve never done anything like that before. I never want to do anything close to it again, including shouting and being aggressive. She broke up with me last night, but she said she wants me to be her friend. That’s fine with me. I want to build that trust back with her. I believe she’d be more honest with me if I were less intimidating during tense conversations. I started an anger management course this week. I’ve spent the last month reading every self-help lit I could find. I’m making a daily effort, and I’ve made some progress already, but I know it takes more time. I’m beyond ready to get my anger under control. I hate that it took something this horrible to wake up. I feel terrible, right now. I could really use some encouragement from people with the same struggles. How do I show her that I’m trying, without seeming like I’m manipulating her into coming back? I do want her to come home, but not before she’s ready.

EDIT: Found out last night that she’s actually in a different state than she said she was, staying with her ex-boyfriend. She’s had the trip planned since August, so she’s been cheating since before our fights got really bad. She pinned the blame on me. She abandoned me with all the bills, her pet, and all of her things. I can’t uphold my lease by myself, and I moved my life across the country for her, so she’s effectively ruined my life for the foreseeable future. 
Needless to say, she’s no longer a part of my motivation to get better.",1

i feel like im rightfully pissed off, and it's normal to want to accuse someone, but everyone in my family is teating me like some sort of unhinged maniac. i was crying and yelling, but not swearing, at everyone last night. they all gave me faces and were saying things like ""you need to calm down"" and ""its easily fixed"". then my mom and brother and grandma all started telling me that it was my fault for having a cup of water on my desk. grandma even suggested that i was in the wrong for having water upstairs at all. thats when i totally lost it and started swearing at people. i went in my room and just screamed and screamed and sobbed, and punched the shit out of my legs until i fell asleep. i know i probably got out of hand near the end. but now i just dont know if something IS wrong with me or if im reacting normally.

An urge just to grab a metal bat and completely wreck anything and everything in my bedroom. I actually a slight adrenaline flowing when this random urge happens. I just don't get it. Why would would anyone want to wreck their stuff?

I've always been the calm, quiet, reserved kind of guy. Well, I did have fee roid rage episodes during intense chemo as a teen, but that's beside the point. I personally blame retail as working with the public will drain smash your soul into nothingness. The rest of the blame goes to my self-worth, depression, loneliness, suicidal ideation.

I avoid confrontation. I stay quiet and keep to myself. High stress/pressure where I get trapped just tears me up on the inside because I'm desperately trying not to display any fear or anger. To the point of shaking, trying to breathe, sweating, and just breaking down to the floor. It's why I'm better off alone.

I also hit my temple against a wall corner whilst running as a kid. I had to get stitches. I am writing this because I wonder if it impacted my prefrontal cortex? For me it's more irritability than anger on most days. I don't like answering too many questions, I hate when people disrespect me and I hate it when people are unfair. I try so hard to keep my cool. I have an awful personality, I can't let lose and take everything seriously. I keep mental notes of how people did me wrong and  many other issues. I wish I was a happy, sweet and goofy woman.",1
"ive heard for years that the worst thing you can do is bottle up your emotions and hold on to anger for extended periods since when you do ""explode"" you'll go way overboard and do something you might regret. the way i came up to deal with this was ""pops"" or burst of permissible anger which mostly consist of yelling and cussing, but no harm to myself, environment or people. i do this so it doesn't build and lets me move past something small by getting all the gas out at once. however, if perception of this paints me as a volotile person, even if i do it in private, does that mean its unhealthy? if anger catches you off guard, i feel like the worst thing you can do is stew on it, but is letting it off in even a controlled outburst still unhealthy?",1
"First time poster using a throwaway for my safety.

Spouse has anger issues and has had for years. I wasn't present for his latest outburst but he raged at one of his closest relatives during a family party. He told me what he recalled of it, and focused on the minor disagreement before the long period of angry behaviour. I called the other person and got their version. There are big holes in spouse's account, and I honestly think he is unable to remember what he says and does when he's in full flow. This has happened before, on a smaller scale but I always thought I was the one with the faulty recollection. I've no reason to doubt the other person's account, and it's been corroborated in part by others.

Has anyone on this sub experienced an anger blackout like this? I need to make sure it's a real thing before I approach him since he doesn't seem to think he's done anything wrong.",1
"I never noticed about this problem until I went to therapy for something completely unrelated.

"Age 4 - parents divorced, caught several times cutting my own hair and throwing tantrums

age 6 - harmfully scratching another girl in my school, like, really hard (she bled) because she tagged me. also caught cutting other girl's hair

age 8 - vandalizing peoples things at school, literally takings shits in peoples yards, eating random plants and trying desperately to convince people i was a vampire

i know this all kind of sounds humorous but i am just realizing that being angry/weird and fucking up is like engrained in me.

age 10-11 - spreading rumours about my friends, swearing in front of teachers (sometimes at them) lying, skipping school, cutting myself (i stopped doing this relatively quick)

age 12-14 - weed, alcohol, got involved with a 27 year old man (when i was 14) who i was excited about at the time, but now i am feeling super violated because of him. stomach pumped one new years eve from drinking too much and constantly putting my friends down. 

age 15 - 16 - peer pressuring my friends to do prescription drugs with me, (one of my friends overdosed and went to the hospital, they are okay, thank goodness)  joined an incredibly toxic relationship where the guy cheated and i was obsessed with knowing exactly who with and i also hit him/ pinched him/ did whatever to inflict pain when i was mad at him.

age 17 - 18  - joined another toxic relationship with a guy who cared so much that he would be upset with me for hanging out with my friends sometimes. i completely gave into him and ended up losing connection with my friends. he also had a kid and his ex gf called me so many things that i began to resent him for being with me and allowing me to move in with him when i would have to deal with his past for as long as we were together. i am not happy to say ive hit him and treated him cruelly as well. he called the cops on me. ive really pushed my boundaries and i am in the process of moving out now to better myself and also let him move on from me.

now - i am realizing that so many of my actions in my previous years were fuelled by anger and also feeling alienated. ( i never had a dad in my life and my mom and i lived on welfare checks because she was unable to work) now i find myself dwelling on small things ( like a short conversation that i got weird vibes from) and thinking everyone hates me because of the various things i had done as a kid (small town, everyone knows)

now i am trying to practise mindfulness. im also slightly anti social as i have no real friends in this new city and im ashamed to be around my old fiends. the only person i hang out with is my boyfriend but i am moving out this month.

does anyone else have an extremely consistent track record of very strange coping mechanisms? i have been angry for as long as i can remember, even slamming my room door when i was a kid and just screaming into a pillow. 

i'm not sure what this stemmed from but i moved around alot as a kid and never had a father figure. that probably contributes and like i dont think i was self aware at all until recently.

weird. :(",1
I got angry and lashed out on my family I feel like nobody cares about me which they don’t because if they did my parents would’ve got me the help that I needed but they didn’t so I feel like I was left alone to deal with this depression by myself and it angers me to know that I’m misunderstood and people don’t even care enough to understand so that’s why I got so angry,1
"I am usually very charming person but there are something that bug me and press a button in me . I Burst out in anger . 

We have one Bathroom on our house and we are 4 persons living in the house including my mom and dad . I like to keep things tidy and clean and I try to keep the bathroom empty, clean and dry as much as possible . I Don't like Towels in the bathroom and I have told everyone to use them and take out of the bathroom . I have told my dad that also but her has a habit of hanging his towel inside at all times . I told him once, twice , dozens of times but still he does it . Today I found out that he put a new hook in especially to hang his towel . I got furious and told him that this is a Shared Bathroom . No one hangs their towels inside , why do you ? It got into a heated argument and my mom got involved and I burst out on her also saying she always takes her husband side over mine . 

I know I am not entirely wrong as towels in the bathroom makes it mouldy and smelly plus all kinds of gems can form . But the way I handle things is horrible . I know I need to change but how matter I try I cannot .

My poor parents have learned to live with my Bullshit attitude and I am seriously thinking what would their life be without me . They would definitely be happier and more free to do whatever they wanted .

The ugly part is that the house in under my name which my dad gifted to me . I feel bad but I just like things clean . I don't know its a disorder or I am bipolar or idk whats wrong with me .

Has anyone got any family member that has severe anger issues ? How do you deal with it ? Is there a way to fix it ?

Thanks",1
"Sorry for the long post. 



For a bit of background, I’m a 37yo married male. I grew up with mostly just my mom as I stopped seeing my dad when I was 14yo. While my mom is a caring person, I learned a lot about yelling and fighting, anger and aggression, and other bad habits from her due to her own mental health issues. I’ve been married to a wonderful woman now for 10 years (14 all in) who has put up with my issues for a long time. I have a nice healthy mix of depression, anxiety, and anger. While I’ve been in and out of therapy over the years, up until the beginning of the summer, I had not been medicated since high school. I am currently in therapy and have a neurontin prescription. I also have a Xanax script, but up until last night, I’ve been hesitant to fill it. 



Back at the beginning of the summer, my wife and I went on a trip to VA Beach. It was a good time, but I had some anxiety issues that blew up on my way home when I started freaking out and blamed my wife, angrily, for my problems. She finally snapped and told me I had to get my shit together (which is true). 



While I am, overall, a relatively calm person, things can set me off, with her mostly, that cause me to go from 0-60 in no time. Yelling, being aggressive (never physically, but still scary), and having blinders on. Last night, however, scared even me. 



The following is from my journal (that I haven’t written in since August) about last night. Part of this is just so I can let it out somewhere, but maybe someone out there can help me sort this out. I can never tell when the anger is going to strike. Overall, I’ve been doing better with controlling it and my anxiety, but obviously, I don’t have it all under control. I don’t have a support group or friends, and right now, I won’t see my therapist until the end of the month, though I’m going to reach out today to try and get in sooner. Names have been removed. Hopefully this isn’t considered a rant. 



My wife just got home today from Miami. I was super excited to see her. She's not feeling well given that she's basically been up for 2 days and her and her friend drove straight from key west to DC to home. We went to bed together around 815pm and she passed out pretty quickly. Then she started snoring. By 11pm, I still couldn't fall asleep and I flipped my shit. She had taken her ambien and was so hard passed out that I couldn't get her up to move around. I lost my shit. I woke her up aggressively and started yelling about not being able to sleep and having to sleep in the other room. That was not the right thing to do at all. She got really upset, which she had every right to do. She asked what I thought my exact plan was. Was I feeling better making her feel worse? I was such an asshole. We talked about this before she left, the sleeping thing with the snoring, and we already discussed getting a futon in her office, and I didn’t even remember that in the moment. I was so wrapped up in being tired, having to get up for work in 6 hours, that I didn’t stop to think. I was running on this asshole autopilot that I just can’t seem to shake. There’s absolutely NOTHING I can do to rectify this situation. I feel like this is, in particular, a bigger fuckup than usual. She did nothing wrong. It’s not her fault she snores, nor is it her fault that I can’t fucking sleep through anything. I guess I should maybe get that Xanax prescription filled - obviously the anger still exists and I haven’t figured out how to address it in the moment. To add to it all, she feels like I did all of it on purpose. Not that I planned it, but once it started, I couldn't shut it off. I think that hurts the most and scares me the most. To me, it's like a surreal flashback of something that happened that doesn't totally feel like it was me.

"I used to be able to laugh jokes off and people dissing me but I get my feelings hurt now and threaten them or get violent, I hate being like this cuz I’m like this with my own friends n I feel like they don’t mean it the way I interpret it. I tend to push them away and regret it.",1
"I had anger issues my entire childhood. So my parents put me in martial arts, and it helped, gave me an outlet. And it worked for a long while. But now I’ve been in college for a few years, and while the knowledge remained, the discipline wore off. As I’ve been in college I’ve only used the skills I’ve worked for 2 times. Each in self defense. But lately, I can’t explain why, but I’ve just been praying for someone to give me a reason. And I don’t know why. I don’t want to hurt anyone. And I wouldn’t hurt anyone for no reason. But it just feels like. I need a reason, or I’m gonna explode",1
"So yesterday, an ex friend and I nearly got into a fight. He did something very uncalled for (busted my lip) and I nearly shoved into the pavement.

I yelled what the fuck and he just kept walking. It took me every inch of my being not to slam my fist into the back of his head for that bull shit. So I texted him how I felt, and boy was it virulent.

I never thought I could drop so many F bombs in a single paragraph. Only time when I stopped cussing at him was when he gave me some half-assed apology. Though his shitty attitude changed when I told him my lip was busted. From there on, I ended the convo because I was about to say some shit I was bound to regret.

Thing is, I’ve never went off on spmeone like that. Sure I may get grumpy or frustrated, but I was never that close to actually hitting someone before. All I remember before I went off was a voice telling me “Don’t let that cunt get away with that unscathed”, and kaboom...

So what are the steps I need to take? I don’t want to lose everything because some fiery temper causes me to do something stupid. I’ve heard meditation helps, but I’m also considering Martial Arts to show me humility. 

I don’t know, I’m genuinely in shock typingg this post",1
"I get extremely pissed off when I play video games occasionally. Mainly if I'm playing and I feel that I'm just sucking or the game is treating me unfairly. I just get this guttural sense of rage and literally want to smash something. Occasionally I do. I've broken quite a few too many things as of late during this... I don't understand where it stems from and I don't know how to stop it. I don't want to stop playing video games though. I also don't know if I need therapy or something, because I feel that I get frustrated way too easily and I have this type of anger in sports as well. I just need help with it",1
"I'm a 28 y.o. male with a good career and recently engaged. I am physically fit and work out often. That all being stated, I'm trying to figure out where my annoyance with everyone comes from. I've always been this way it feels like, but I guess I'm tired of trying to avoid it as an issue.

I was at a public meeting for work recently and noticed that while everyone was mingling with each other and in generally good spirits, for seemingly no good reason at all, I felt annoyed with these people. None of them had done more than say hello to me, but just seeing the smiles on their face was upsetting. ""How stupid is this all?"" and ""I really don't want to be here"" type statements kept crossing my mind. Given I was on the ass end of a 12-hour work day, it doesn't take much from people to get me to this state of mind. Literally just existing around me is enough to trigger my annoyance. I'm tired of being the asshole, but its who I am.

My day-to-day at work consists of being around many high-energy people who, you guessed it, annoy me to high hell. It begins to fester in the morning and by the time I'm ready to leave I cannot stand the people in my office for another second. And they really don't do anything that should warrant my annoyance. As I stated, I have a good career that pays the bills and then some, but is ultimately unfulfilling. I feel like my anger with these people is a large contributor to it feeling unfulfilling. I get in this downward negative spiral of thoughts once the annoyance begins and end up in a place where I'm thinking that this job sucks and I'm killing my time here.

Its getting to the point to where I'm having trouble enjoying anything unless its stimulates me. I can't just sit and be somewhere that most people would at least be neutral in. I feel like a spoiled child who throws tantrums when they aren't where they want to be, but instead of kicking and screaming its deeply negative internal thoughts.

There's more, but I think this generally sums up the anger I'm dealing with. I don't know if I came here to get help or if I just needed to see this typed out in a public forum for my own cathartic reasons.",1

"Like the title says, I am new to this sub and was pretty grateful when I found it. I am a young man in my 20's who is dealing with a lot of built up anger over the years but it's really starting to affect me and my relationship with my gf now, it has been increasingly worse from about 3 years ago when I first noticed how bad things could get with anger. 

A little insight, so my childhood did not have the best impact on me after living with my family for so long. Lots of fighting, screaming, yelling, drugs, abuse, moving out before i was 18, etc. I've always thought that this was just ""normal"" to live like you're mad at everything since everyone I've ever met is like this as far as I can remember. I'm not gonna lie and say it was constant anger 24/7 but there were a lot of memories that involved an unneeded amount of anger, abuse tactics, and screaming. 

Fast forward to when I first got into my relationship that I am in now. (Just to clarify, she's my angel and has stuck by me and been very supportive when I need anything at all) 3 years ago I never got THAT angry or upset when something happened. I remember how she would try to show me how my upbringing with my family was not healthy at all and she encouraged me to be a better person overall. This is where the anger really began, I'm not sure if it was because she wanted me to set up boundaries with my family as they've been nothing but disrespectful to me and her since she met them or if I was really that dead set against changing myself.. Either way, she showed me how this or that reaction is wrong or how my family should respect me enough to not go insane and yell when something doesn't go their way. (They always make it out to be like my gf's the bad guy simply because she doesnt want me to grow up like them, because of this, they always point the finger at her when something is wrong. Ex- ""Everything was fine until you met that little b-word!"" Or ""Don't get mad at me because you want to follow that b-word around and do what she tells you to do!) Basically, I was caught between the whole ""family forever"" stigma and the most caring and considerate girl who just wants me to grow into a better person for the greater good of our futures together. 

I started lashing back, almost resenting her because of the fact that every time I told my gf a story about my childhood she would tell me how this or that was wrong and they/I should have never acted that way in the first place. I was getting to the point that I didn't want to tell stories anymore. It made me furious knowing that she was right, every time she was always right. 

Now, 3 years down the line. I have yet to take action on any of my anger issues, it's getting to the point where it is affecting my mood at work (I'm in sales, on commission only, so if I don't sell then I don't get paid) and most importantly, it's affecting my relationship with her. She has been nothing but phenomenal this entire time, we argue some days but that is mostly because I don't want to be wrong about how I was raised and once again, she is always right about this kind of stuff. Another reason we argue is my attitude is always crap. (Yesterday for example, everything was fine until late that night when I thought about having to return to work today. I got extremely frustrated and just caught a bad attitude, I then proceeded to complain about how work is crap and this is crap for a solid hour or so when in reality I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO WORK YESTERDAY SO THERE WAS NO REASON TO COMPLAIN!) She has encouraged me over and over again to manifest positivity and break the old habits/connections in my brain. I know deep down that I am turning an eye on my childhood and it's not a healthy habit to pick up. I realize that my anger is unacceptable, she has taught me about how your brain can break old habits and form new ones by just manifesting the change. It has worked in some cases but not the ones that are most important to me like this relationship. 

I am not going to drag this out and tell you every detail about how my anger had ruined more days then not with her. I will say that I am finally at a crossroad where I can either grow up and get over my anger or unfortunately lose the best girl that has ever opened my eyes to something new. I know you're reading this and thinking that this guy is just full of excuses but to be fair that's what I think most times when I reflect on these situations so I guess you're not wrong. I feel like my head has been building up anger over and over until it's just a sea of complex issues that I never actually got through. (I have a habit of getting over an issue instead of getting THROUGH it like a normal brain) The only issue with this is that I have pushed it to a point that I am annoyed to deal with MYSELF and MY brain functions. I have read that meditation can be a form of relief but I'm so flustered that I cannot clear my head. It's always, one conversation here, another here, some weird pictures from something I saw that day, and some random song playing in the background for whatever reason.. Either way, I NEED to learn how to manage my brain and my anger, it's LITERALLY going to ruin my relationship if i don't pull my head together and actually commit to being a better person. 

Any advice, tips, tricks, or just some tough love and reasoning is greatly appreciated. It's hard for me to find resources on the web and I unfortunately do not have the funds to enroll myself in some solid therapy programs. Either way, I NEED to be a better person for myself but mostly for my gf's sake. (She doesn't like to say it but I feel like this has all taken a huge toll on who she is as a person and I don't want anything to make her feel worse then I already have)


Thank you all for reading all of this.",1
"I haven't had significant anger problems in my past. I could still go 0 - 100 in less time than necessary when younger l, but being a larger guy I've learned to be self-conscious and contain/suppress my temper.

Currently, I'm in a very stressful situation. I work nights, my downstairs neighbour is unreasonably loud during the day (walks like his feet are made of lead and slams every God forsaken door in his apt. I've spoken to him calmly before. I'm also fasting 20hrs a day and generally don't have patience with people after I try to communicate with them properly.

I work in customer service with a variety of demanding/entitled clients, I'm still fine-tuning myself to the demeanor of some of my colleagues and I'm a hair short of kicking my neighbour's door off the hinges and beating him with it. Bref, I have lots of moments of quick flares lately and my containment capacity is currently think. I've felt the patience threshold thinning over the last few months.

"How do you forgive yourself for being so barbaric towards people you care about?

We all make mistakes in life but something like this takes a toll on our emotional &amp; mental health. I've been struggling with anger issues &amp; everytime when things go wrong, my instincts kick in &amp; I end up seriously beating the poor family member. It makes me depressed",1
"I've always struggled with anger, but it's something I felt I had gotten mostly under control when I got into my late teens and early twenties. After reflecting, I realize those years where I had it ""under control"" really meant I just self medicated with weed and other bad habits for the underlying depression, anxiety, and lack of appropriate coping strategies that I believe the anger stems from.


When I quit smoking weed, tried changing habits, and started seeking actual professional help for my mental health, I found that the anger still returned in certain situations. It doesn't happen as easily as it used to, but it still has the same intensity. Whenever something builds up enough, I hold it in and hold it in and if it doesn't go away then I explode. Unfortunately, my wife is the one who brings it out in me the most because she doesn't let me walk away from upsetting things. I'm not blaming her for this because I know I should learn how to handle those situations better. For example, we get into stupid bickering matches and when it goes on for too long, I just get so angry. I don't hit her, but I say nasty things, slam doors, punch walls, etc.


Last night, I stormed off and punched a door and made a hole. I told my wife and she was really upset. I called her from work today and we talked and I apologized for everything, but she said she's still not sure how to react. She's seen me get angry before, but this is the first time she's seen actual physical damage. I know this isn't healthy, but I've been able to hide things I've broken from people before. Now it's out in the open and someone I love is seeing it first hand. I just feel so embarrassed and that I'm some monster that my own wife now has trouble talking to... I know if I want to keep our relationship healthy then I'll need to learn how to express my anger in a healthier way and not have these stupid outbursts. I'm worried about seeing her when I get off work and seeing the hurt in her eyes and face. I just hope it's something we can recover from and she doesn't feel scared or nervous around me.

I'm sorry for the lengthy, rambling post. I'm just really sad and thought the community here might be able to give some advice on how I can change.",1
"So my girlfriend of a few months has guinea pigs and I truly do love them; however, one of them has started chattering at me (clicking teeth together to express anger or to intimidate). The pig in question isn’t too terribly fond of people, but is still receptive of them. For some reason however, when this one chatters at me I see nothing but red. I feel so ashamed to write this about a fucking guinea pig of all things but it can be pretty bad. I haven’t caused any sort of harm to the guinea pig other than annoying the shit out of it when it chatters at me, causing it to chatter more, causing me to get more angry, and so on. The past few days I’ve had some pretty harsh headaches because I’ve been clenching my teeth so bad in anger. My only concern truly is to attempt to reverse any sort of negative thoughts/feelings the pig has towards me and to be able to control my own anger. It feels like cuteness aggression gone out of control. I’ll typically start petting it, but I’ll get too close to one of his legs or his butt (they don’t like their lower back/butts touched lol) and then he starts chattering. So then I start petting him more aggressively which leads to more chattering or him running to the other side of the cage. Naturally I simply move to the other side of the cage and this whole dance continues. Sometimes I will snatch him up (in an aggressive manner) and hold him in front of me. I don’t really know why maybe I’m just fucking mad and what to try to intimidate him but it just takes over me and I do things. Again, I have never once caused any sort of physical harm to either of the guinea pigs. In fact, the one in question has bitten me twice and both times I tried to comfort him because I obviously scared or angered him so badly that he felt the need to bite me. When he bit me it’s almost like it sobered me up. Once I pick up the pig and let him sit on my lap while I’m at my desk or on my bed he doesn’t seem to be “angry” with me or whatever. Which leads me to believe that he’s particularly territorial and doesn’t want me around him in his cage. Again these things truly are adorable and I hate that I’m this way and I really want to stop for my sake, the pig’s sake, and my girlfriends. I’ve thought about going to therapy for this; however, it seems like a niche thing that might be difficult to counteract with therapy or find a therapist that can actually help me. So I come here to Reddit to see if anyone has any pointers/tips to help me overcome this on my own. 

Thanks",1
"I adore my girlfriend. She has truly helped me see the error of my anger filled ways. My previous GFs were very emotionally manipulative, my father abandoned me, and my mother constantly told me I won’t make friends because I’m too weird. My GF says that she believes those types of “backstories” is what lead me to being short fused. 


But I don’t want an excuse. I want actionable steps to be a better partner.  We barely fight, but when we do, it flies off the handle. Yelling. On both parts. Name calling on my part (her part not as much).  When we’re not fighting, it’s absolutely fine. Sure we bicker here and there, but overall everything is awesome....except for when I get mad during arguments. 



We just finished a 2 week documentary gig together.  Our boss was a nightmare. We both ended up pulling 4 24 hour days with 2 hours of sleep per day because our boss would send editing notes past deadline, then implement impossible deadlines.  Example; “I just sent you the script. edit the entire 28 minute episode of this show in 8 hours. I need an assembly cut.”  My GF and I passed through this awful boss with flying colors. No bickering. No fights. We supported each other so well!! We even commented that it was a true bonding experience through a traumatic and emotionally abusive boss (we both quit after my higher up editing friends informed me that that was not industry standard. Contrary to our boss’s words). 

Fast forward 3 days after wrap. 



We argued. It was quite heated.  She saw a text from my ex that was from before we were dating and it made her insecure. In her insecurity, she yelled at me. I yelled back and got more mad than necessary. Now, don’t think she was going through my phone, no. My ex texted me saying she met one of my favorite comic book artists; the texts before that were from MONTHS ago; before my current GF and I started dating. My GF realizes that she needn’t be mad. But it’s too late. I’m seeing red after her yelling. Anyways, she corners me next to the TV, trying to hug me to make the fight go away. However, when I am seeing red, I don’t like to be touched. I just need to listen to John Denver and I calm down. My GF is aware of this process but still kept trying to bear hug me. I got so mad that I couldn’t control myself...and I punched the TV. I’m so ashamed. Not because the Tv was mine, but because the look on her face made me disgusted with myself. She was scared. Because I punched the TV. 

Once things calmed down, I apologized and she said that it feels like I am trying to intimidate her.  I informed her that since I was a kid, when anger took over, for some reason it would disappear when I punch something. SUPER IMMATURE. I KNOW.  but the thing is, she is 4’11 and I’m 6’1. No shit she’s scared. I’m not going to hurt her, but how could she know that when I hit a TV!? It’s perfectly acceptable for her to be scared and I told her that. To not be ashamed for being scared. 


I have signed up for anger management since that fight. I’m journaling. Reading articles on CBT. But I wanted to ask ya’ll Redditors for some advice as well. What are some actionable things you do when you feel the anger creeping up? What do you do to stifle that feeling? I can feel it coming, but sometimes I just can’t fight it!


Help! I want to be the best boyfriend I can be for my partner. And I want to be the best human I can be for myself and my career. My career requires a lot of problem solving, having lots of people under you, and many many things going wrong. I’ve never had an issue with anger at work; however, you never know. I want to learn and be better.",1
"For context, I’m a 25-year-old female. My mother makes me furious, everything she says or does just gets on my nerves. She has a tendency of bringing out the worst in me. When I’m by myself, I’m calm and relaxed and I like the person I am. The moment she steps into the room my heart pounds and I turn into this completely different person: agitated, whiny and with a short fuse. She’s not a bad person at all, even though she does get overly critical and dismissive at times. So why am I reacting this way? What can I do?",1
"I have had anger issues in the past but am glad to say after a lot of meditation and self help reads I am able to hold myself together. My sister on the other hand has not been has woke or fortunate as I have been in my journey and still raises her voice when frustrated. I try to tell her to control herself but that just makes her more mad.

What can I do to have her have a little more self control? It’s so embarrassing when we are in public and I would disassociate  myself with her completely if it wasn’t just about us. She has a two year old husky with severe anxiety and I’m there for her when it comes to him. Unfortunately this also means I am more likely to have to be present with her anger episodes. 

What can I do to push her towards the right path?",1

"This is an update regarding my recent anger outburst. I’ve booked a therapist and all of that but ever since that day where I basically massacred the family bedroom my anger has been starting to boil. You know those temptations where it makes you want to just destroy something? Such as punching a door, punching a hole through glass etc. 

Well just a few moments ago I had an argument with my father regarding my anger and what happened that day. When I mentioned my mother said that I’m just like him he didn’t take it that well and started to berate me on my actions those days ago. Even though I apologized after coming back home he still berated me for that. It wasn’t until I had to take something to the basement where I saw the punching bag. Thinking that I can just focus my frustrations on that I decided to have a few rounds at it. The next thing I remember is my father storming to the basement and getting all in my face asking if I’d bring the entire house down and that I want to be just like him. He then proceeded to push me which caused me to fall onto a wooden desk that has a pointy end which hurt the back of my head.

As soon as I noticed the blood I just looked at him with shock that he just shoved me and caused blood to come out  I felt and heard something snap. I don’t like being touched aggressively and that includes pushing me especially when blood is involved. I just lost it, all I remember is charging at him and hitting him until luckily my mother noticed the commission and saw me batter him and forced me off of him. Before I could even explain my mother yelled “GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE, LOOK WHAT YOU’VE DONE TO HIM! HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH A THING!?” the last thing I saw before leaving the house was my mother helping my father up who now has a bloody nose and a few scuffs on his face, after that I got out of the house and immediately called my therapist saying to move the appointment to tomorrow. 

Obviously I’m not welcome back to my home for now since I basically lost it on my father for pushing me and causing me to bleed for just letting my frustrations out on the punching bag. Due to me being above 18 years of age I’m worried that my parents will press charges on me since I gave him a bloody nose. But this is the 2nd instance where I had an angry moment within one week.

It’s all my fault, well mostly my fathers and myself since I basically took influence from him when it comes to getting the anger out either by punching a wall and all of that and myself watching those “Psycho Dad” videos made by that Mcjuggernuggets guy which gave me more bad ideas on getting my anger out. What else should I do? How can I get through this? How do I come back to my parents and apologize for beating up my very own father? What do I do if they decide to press charges on me for what I just did? So many questions are running through my head. I didn’t even mean all of this to happen! I fee so regretful right now. I let my emotions get to me, I snapped at my very own flesh and blood... 

I feel like you guys are the only people that understands what I’m going through since we all have some form of anger issues. I really need your advice on what to do next. I’m afraid on what to face after what happened...",1
"For the last 4-5 years i've been on top of my anger issues, i take beta blockers to stop me getting worked up, i've not gotten into any physical fights in that same time frame but today i got a snotty text from my director at work and it just made me want to literally bite somebody.


Basically i run a kitchen in a restaurant, i recently implemented a very strict uniform and cleaning regime so we don't have to worry about health and safety, or pest control etc. 


One of my staff who's worked for the company for at least a year longer than me decided to go over my head, for at least the 4th time, to my director and make up something that i'm a hypocrite for not being willing to do the work i'm expecting people to do, even though i spent the last 3 months drilling into people the importance of time management and cleaning, whilst being patient and listening to these people. Now because of his complaints i've lost my right to write my rotas, i've lost holidays, i'm having my job role in the company questioned and lost my right to profit sharing. Right now i want to go to his house and slice him apart in his sleep, whilst he and my director post heart emojis on each other's posts on the work facebook group. 



On the flip side, the rotas which i laboriously slaved over to get everybody their allocated days off is now ruined, people are getting in touch with me to try and fix it, but it's impossible because its out of my hands, and its only adding to my frustration towards this guy.



The last time i felt this sort of rage and animosity, i put a guy in hospital. but tomorrow i need to go in and be civil, even though i think if i don't explode at him, i'll probably knock his teeth out.



How would any of you deal with this, sorry if it's a bit incoherent, ive been drinking to try and calm down.",1
"I have anger issues, that's a given now. However, it tends to be with loved ones. There's been a few times where they've gotten the better of me. I might have squeezed an ex's wrist too hard, or just screamed and banged a table in rage in audible distance of a family member. Today I loomed over my sister glaring at her in rage because of something she said, and her husband told me I had to calm down. I didn't think it was aggressive at the time, but now I see it was. I struggle to forgive myself for these actions because I'm scared they'll happen again, and I need to find a way to control them. I'm terrified one day I'll strike someone close to me in a rage.",1
"NVC = Non-Violent Communication

I have been seeking help for answers to explain why I wake up each morning with a burning rage in my chest. I haven't been able to remember a dream or nightmare in the past three years thanks to my nightly Marijuana regimen. I limit my interactions with society and feel comfortable in my daily routine of work/life balance. However, I still suffer from uncontrollable rage at the slightest provocation. I saught the help of mental health professionals throughout my young adult life but I never found a good fit. The medication I would receive made me feel like a zombie and I eventually stopped taking it but I soon began to realize my anger was taking over my daily life. A simple drive to the store had the potential to turn into a traffic light brawl due to my road rage and lack of patience. A simple conversational debate had the potential to turn into threats and/or actions of violence. It is exhausting to live with so much anger in my heart and I just want to find happiness and peace so that I can become a productive member of society. 

My quest for peace and happiness led me to the local library and I started browsing the psychology section with books about anger and how to communicate with the world around me in a less confrontational way. I read a very interesting book about non-violent communication and it focused on ways to step out of the 'who's right, who's wrong?' conflict paradigm, and instead, to realize that people are always acting in a way to attempt to get their needs met. No one is wrong; it's just a matter of finding strategies to meet each other's needs.

The expression of anger by hitting, blaming, hurting others--whether physically or emotionally--are all superficial expressions of what is going on within us when we are angry. The first step to fully expressing anger in NVC is to separate the other person from any responsibility for our anger. We rid ourselves of thoughts such as, ""He (or she or they) made me angry when they did that."" Such thinking leads us to express our anger superficially by blaming or punishing the other person. The behaviors of others may be a stimulus for our feelings, but not the cause. It is important to establish a clear separation between stimulus and cause.

Whenever we are angry, we are finding fault--we are judging or blaming the other person for being wrong and deserving punishment. Even if we are not initially conscious of it, the cause of anger is located in our own thinking. Anger is a result of life-alienating,  violence-provoking thinking that is diconnected from needs. It indicates that we chose to judge somebody rather than focus on which of our needs are not getting met. At the core of all anger is a need that is not being fulfilled. Thus anger can be valuable if we use it as an alarm clock to wake us up--to realize we have a need that isn't being met and that we are thinking in a way that makes it unlikely to be met. 

To fully express anger requires full consciousness of our need. In addition, energy is required to get the need met. Anger, however, disrupts our energy by redirecting it toward punishing people rather than meeting our needs. Instead of engaging in ""righteous indignation,"" we need to connect empathetically with our own needs or those of others. Consciously replace the phrase ""I am angry because they..."" with ""I am angry because I am needing..."" All violence is the result of people tricking themselves into believing that their pain derives from other people and that consequently those people deserve to be punished. 

Why would people want to tell the truth, knowing they will be judged or punished for doing so? The more people hear blame and judment, the more defensive and aggressive they become and the less they will care about our needs in the future. The more we empathize with what leads people to behave in the ways that are not meeting our needs, the more likely it is that they will be able to reciprocate afterwards. 

If you made it to the end, thanks for reading :-)

TL;DR: I learned of ways to communicate my anger in a non-violent way and wanted to share! The four steps to expressing anger are (1) stop and breathe, (2) identify your judgmental thoughts, (3) connect with our needs, and (4) express our feelings and unmet needs.",1
"Hi! I am new to this subreddit. I came here mostly because I have dealt with this emotion all of my life and it is seriously affecting my quality of life and my relationships with the people I mostly care about. I have had a lot of things happen to me for which I have been to therapy for, however, I feel like the worst side effect of my trauma is anger. I get mad about very little things, I have a really short temper, and arguing is nearly impossible for me. I take things personally and cannot separate logically. It is very hard for me to argue because I get mad really easy and I burst by saying things I really don’t mean. I don’t have patience, it is hard for me to argue coherently, and it is very hard for me to express my feelings in a logical and healthy way. I say what I feel and it seems like I don’t even have a filter, I try my best but it really has not worked, it has improved a little but it is still hard, and if there is a ver upsetting situation I just burst into anger and say the worst things possible. I often get anxiety attacks once I reach like this and I know I have hurt my loved ones. I have been to therapy for everything except this, I feel like my therapists want to threat things from my past and I really need to work on this because it is affecting my present in the worst way possible. Any tips, any books to read? I feel like there is no solution... I feel really hopeless, this has affected my life in serious ways, it is hard for me to make friends, I always look at the bad in people, I feel like I am crazy. Appreciate your thoughts and help.",1
So sometimes when I go to the bathroom or to take a shower I’ll look at myself in the mirror to like fix my hair or check how my skin is etc.  however usually it always ends up turning into a deep conversation with myself or what seems like myself in the mirror about murder and just rage. I’ve taken note of it and have decided to take away anything in my bathroom where I can see my reflection. Idk if anyone else has had anything like this or if it’s just me but if any else has please tell me what you experience if it’s the same or different or if you’ve been through this and have found ways to stop it before it starts or to move on from it.,1
"I have this problem where insignificant talk angers me. I could never sustain a relationship because a pointless text message like ""good morning"" from a partner really hits the anger nerve. I'm on good terms with my parents but whenever one of them calls to randomly chat, I just sit in silence listening and answer back with 1-3 worded sentence. Friends who send memes or talk incessantly gets the silent treatment. I have a few friends who keep the bantering to a minimum and only message me when it's important, I like these people a lot.

I've never expressed the anger outwardly to anyone. I'm fairly sure if something doesn't add to my world experience, the inner rage build. Would you deem this as the cause or is there something more deeply rooted?",1
"I go in the anxiety and depression subs and have been diagnosed with dysthymia (just always depressed) and social anxiety and general anxiety as well as ocpd (I kind of doubt) but for some reason this sub makes me feel the most understood. Maybe my counselor and I are treating the wrong problems.

Also... I've been having bad nightmares. Stuff I would clearly never do but I'm wondering why it's happening. I've been having dreams of telling family members off and fighting them (nice version). All I can think is I have some serious trauma issues I need to resolve and it's keeping me from getting along with people.

I often feel like I'm ready to fight or go off on someone if one person says something to me at work. When I'm angry I snap. I lose track of what's going on around me. I can't focus because all I want is to fight. 

I've been told try not to ruminate but as you can see rumination is now in my dreams as well. 

Some stuff that kind of helps... Breaking shit. Listening to rock music and head banging. Punching bags/ boxing. Running (which I can't do much rn 7 months pregnant). And cussing. That's about it.",1
"Do folk honestly not realize that telling someone to calm down achieves the opposite? It's so infantilizing and makes it hard for me to feel like what I'm going through is valid. Yes, I do have anger issues which makes it harder for me to not want to smash someone's face in.

How do you react when told to calm down? What's a good response?",1
I feel like I’m drowning in my anger but can not pin point the exact place it comes from. I have a great job a loving fiancée and a family that loves me but I can’t shake the feeling of complete rage in my chest. I have gotten to the point of secluding myself from everyone and have even taken a night shift position at work as to not interact with people. I am afraid of getting to close and letting anyone in because I know I will destroy everything.,1
"I think my anxiety leads to worse anger but I am very angry a lot. Most of it's internal but I have strong urges to lash out at people. I'm never physical but I have exploded on people verbally. Usually random strangers if they look at me a certain way or cut me off or just do anything I perceive as rude. I usually keep it all inside but a few times in my life I've lashed out. I have a very negative view of people and I feel like they all hate me. I'm constantly in an angry, defensive mood. 
But when I hold it all in, it ruins my day. I get angry at everything even myself. It's hard for me to let go of this anger.
I don't know how to stop this. I get mad when people stand too close to me, and especially when they start smoking without asking if it's okay. People just dont care and are so inconsiderate. Sometimes I feel it's me, sometimes I feel the world is just so rude. I don't know. 
How do I let go of anger easier? It's so hard for me and it keeps me wound up all day.
I'm 26 and female if that matters.",1
"Not sure if this is the right space for this. Sorry mods. 

Often times I hear from family members that they've never seen anyone so bad like me when I get mad. I feel like I black out into another person that is simply careless and wants to watch the world burn. As much as I try to be a better version of myself day after day, it appears that people simply don't appreciate or don't give a shit. They will still be selfish and not care about anything.

If I may confess, when I let this other version of myself out I feel great for the next hour or so, then later I realize that it wasn't the best reaction.",1

"My boyfriend had broken up with me 2 months ago because i said horrible things in anger and said i want nothing to do with him, blocked and didn’t receive his calls for an hour. Reasons i got angry were valid but the way i reacted definitely wasn’t and i see it. 

Now after2 months, he has agreed to give this another shot and i’ve promised to work on my anger issues. I looked it up and the way i react is called - Hostile Venting. I react this way in anger because my parents have always fought like this in the house. They attack and say really mean things to each other and then make up the next moment and act like everything is normal. But i realise i have to unlearn this and be a better person to my boyfriend. 

We are starting over and he is wary that i might hurt him again. What are things that i can do for this particular problem of mine?",1
"The title pretty much sums it up. For most of my life I've been an angry person but I've always had to keep it inside of me to an unhealthy extent and I believe it has affected me negatively. I recently had a very serious mental breakdown due to a situation I won't go much into depth about. It caused me to mentally break and start throwing myself on the ground screaming bloody murder bashing my head against the floor. Nothing has EVER happened to me like that. The circumstances in which that occured were pretty extreme but it's not like I have don't have an outlet where I release my anger. Typically playing videogames is how I cope but it has become unhealthy so I'm pulling back. My boyfriend is at the brunt of my anger because I feel incredibly comfortable around him and can actually be myself. I don't ever direct my anger twoards him but I can get frustrated with how he handles my outbursts which, through many talks, we have come to a mutual understanding of each other's feelings. We both had grown up in fairly bad households but he developed a different type of reaction to anger than I did. It's a trigger for him while for me it's one of the only ways of communication I experienced growing up. I feel like I adopted the behavior as it was really the only thing I saw growing up. I can get pretty upset and irrational sometimes. Overall, my recent breakdown has lead me to come and ask for help. I really would like some advice on how to not be so angry/how to cope with anger better. I really don't enjoy being labeled as an ""angry person"" even though I really suppress it around others. I also don't want to subject my boyfriend to my anger as not only does it affect him negatively, but it just isn't okay. Any advice or resources will help. Thank you in advance",1
"I'm 14 years old, so this could easily just be a puberty thing, but how do I stop being so damn angry all the time?

I'm just so hot-headed all the time. I'm like a stick on dynamite with an extremely short fuse. Every time my mother speaks, I roll my eyes and get frustrated and just want to leave the room. This has, of course, strained our relationship a lot. Even more than it already was.

Whenever I'm playing a game, I sometimes get so angry that I push my mouse against the wall, slap myself, or slam my desk. Sometimes I can control it, but most times I just get too angry. I've been trying to avoid multiplayer games, but singleplayer games can get to me, too. I have some stress balls next to me, but I just go into tunnel vision and don't even see them. (Nor do stress balls really work anyway, they're often just way too easy to squeeze and don't put up much resistance.)

Everytime I think about me and my past mistakes, even just the tiniest dumb shit that an average 8 year old kid would do, I punch walls, or I scratch myself. Anytime I do or say something wrong, I take it out on myself. I swear all the time, without even realizing it. I just want to not be so angry all the time and actually be able to control my emotions. 

Are there any steps I can take to at least point me in the right direction?",1
"Every single time my mother drives she drives up to 60 miles per hour in a few seconds. On every single road by the way. And then let's it get back to 40, then speeds back to 60. Then slow to 40. Over and over again. When I ask her to stop or drive olnormally because it makes me sick she tells me she's ""not doing anything"" or ""it's not a big deal stop being such a baby"" and I just want to bash her head into the steering wheel.",1
"I've had some significant changes in my life, but my anger has grown over the years too. I've recently (within the past year) developed episodes of rage, of anger attacks, of explosive episodes...I think you get the idea.


But I don't know what truly triggers these events, but when I get angry or frustrated it turns into pure *rage*. Not being pissed off or slightly miffed but pure, explosive rage. I've been depressed for years, and my childhood wasn't purely filled with abuse but I was physically punished from time to time. Growing up my parents were often frustrated and angry. Does anyone else think that what you grow up with seeps its way into your subconscious and you can't help it? Is it just me?



I used to not feel, but nowadays all I feel is either tired or tired *and* angry. A lot of it is with my job. A lot of it has to do with my situation in life. And I wonder if I'll ever graduate out of this mindset that I cannot control; it's a horrible reaction to anything. Even suppressing it when I need to causes more issues.




And yes, I'm in therapy too.",1
"I moved into a house this school year (I'm a sophomore in college).

I punched the 1st hole in my wall when I was drunk after coming back from the bars. I got assaulted by the bouncers and kicked out for literally no reason (I was literally just standing at the bar trying to get a drink) except that the bartender tried to steal from me as I was buying a drink. I got home and thought I had the money in my wallet. I took out my wallet and didn't see the money, raged for a sec and punched the hole, then found the money in my other pocket and felt stupid. The hole is just 1 punch, so its pretty small.

2nd hole I punched 2 days ago after my best friend called me and told me he was in the hospital because he tried to kill himself. also just 1 punch so a small hole.

3rd hole was yesterday. I was talking to my mom on the phone about my friend who tried to kill himself. Her advice to me was ""maybe you should just distance yourself from him because of his problems"" and I thought she was trying to tell me that I should ditch my best friend since I was 14 just because he is struggling. I got super pissed, yelled at my mom, swore at her, hung up the phone and punched my wall like 10 times, creating a massive hole, probably 2 feet tall and 1 foot across. (I called her back afterwards and she wasn't trying to get me to ditch him, she was just worried about it affecting me and my success. She wants me to be there for him, she just wanted me to distance myself emotionally from the situation so I can focus on school and such still while also being supportive)

So my question is when I get angry like that, what can I do besides punch holes in my wall? My mom said I should punch a pillow or something but imo that isn't as good as a wall. I need to break something, but not my walls.

Also if anyone has any other advice with coping with/helping support my friend and his issues please lmk, this is a very hard time for me.",1
"Hi, I wonder if anyone can relate to this. 

Recently, I've been having these really intense, violent fantasies about hurting people who I feel have wronged me. I find myself thinking about what I'd like to do to these  people and worryingly, these thoughts can stick in my head for hours. 

I had a hard time in school and I was also taken advantage of when I was younger and I've never been able to let that go. I want to find those people and hurt them. Now I feel people are doing the same and I don't want them to get away with it. 

I try to set boundaries and present a confident image but clearly that's not working. I'm not confident and I guess people can see that. It's so frustrating. 
I'm getting therapy and support although I don't share these revenge fantasies with anyone. I worry about how I will be judged. 

Am I losing the plot? Is this in anyway normal or do I need a proper head doctor? I know I'm gonna be judged now but I don't care, I need to vent! I need to get this anger out, I just don't know how.   Hopefully, I'm not alone on this...",1
"It all happened that quickly, all I remember was having this huge argument with my family and at the very end, I remember storming out to the family bedroom, kicking open the door pretty sure I messed up the door pins due to my fury. I even saw red on the walls not even kidding. I then proceeded to punch a hole through the window shattering it to little pieces, kicking the TV and massacred the entire room in my anger. To sum things up, tables were flipped, the drawer pulled down was windows were shattered, glass everywhere and the television having a dent from my kick.  I didn't know I could cause so much destruction. All I can recall was that room in a total mess and the rest of the family in utter shock while I stormed out of the house. 

I'm currently at a friend's house typing this whole thing up cause I do not want to see the look on my parent's faces when I come back. Some of you may think ""Oh, I made this up"" or ""Oh, I couldn't do that."" But believe me, once the adrenaline kicks in you do not know how capable your body is able to do. Combine that with hot filled anger.

Where did I get this anger? To sum things up I got this all from my father. As a kid, I would be with him 24/7 and the first time I saw him punch a door down out of anger or made a dent out of the wall planted those seeds in me. Bad ways to let the anger out. I'm usually a calm and chill person but today just set me off due to how bad of a day I had prior to the argument. Growing up, I would watch this video series made by this Youtuber. His Dad would destroy his son's prized possessions with a chainsaw, hammering an award, shattering his car window with a video game console and punching a TV. This fuelled and further made my ways of expressing my anger grow out of hand. This is the first time I ever have gotten to this state of rage.  I'm even shaking after thinking about what just happened those hours ago. I have told my friend about what had happened today and he suggested I seek immediate help such as a therapist. Yes, I know they cost a lot of money but what other means should I seek in order to deal with this? Not only my family was scared on how I reacted today but overall I'm scared of myself, unknowingly having this monster buried deep inside me filled with pent up anger all because of ideas from my father who has a hard time dealing with temperament and having to watch a stupid video series about a psychotic father destroying stuff. My mother even told me I'm becoming just like my father, full of anger when I let it out. Maybe I spent to much time with him? Who knows. But either way, I need to get this checked out asap. Please leave some advice down below. I really need it.

"Hey, new to this sub. I have had anger issues since I was a kid, though I haven't gotten violent or anything and keep it all internal. Lately life is pretty good, I'm living with my SO and his mom who is very chill and we all get along pretty great.

His mom has two chihuahuas, a mom and her dogter, both grown. They came from an abused household and both show signs of it, but I have no issue being patient and Mommy and I bonded for the most part. Puppy, however, acts like I am the one who abused her and I haven't so much as raised my voice at her. I researched some dog language things and am working on things like not making eye contact, or sudden movements, etc. But when I offer them both treats, Mommy eats hers happily and Puppy slinks away with her tail between her legs like I've just yelled at her. She was abused, she needs patience and consistency, logically I understand that.

Here's what I don't get. When Puppy slinks away when offered a treat, or she wants to sit on the couch and notices me there then runs away again, I get this irrational anger boiling up inside me and I want to kick her dumb little self across the room. I would never raise a finger to her and don't want to break the little trust I have, but my heart starts racing and I have to figure out how to vent that anger elsewhere. Why does seeing a small dog cower, sometimes to the point of peeing if I move too quickly, make me so angry and violent inside?",1
"I'm a male, 25 years old. And I can confidently say that I have anger problems.

A few days ago, I went to the grocery store sometime around 6:00am, so this way the store wouldn't be as crowded, and I could get my shopping done in an easy manner.

After getting the groceries, I went out into the parking lot, put my groceries in the backseat, got into my car, and was about to leave. I got distracted by something on my phone while browsing through Twitter. Something that made me feel angry. I'd rather not say what it was. But put it this way...I was just sitting there in my car, staring down at my phone, seething with rage.

But then, out of nowhere, some homeless drug addict guy spotted me sitting in my car. Keep in mind, the area I was in is actually known for having quite a few homeless drug addicts wandering around in the store parking lot. So I'm not just saying that out of spite. This is a fact. This man was more than likely homeless and addicted to drugs. My best guess, probably meth. Usually, I avoid people like this at all costs. Normally, under typical circumstances, I would've avoided eye contact, locked my car doors, and drove away. But I was so mad that I didn't even care. I simply just let him approach my vehicle.

He knocked on the window. Seeing that the car was turned off, I couldn't roll down my window. So I opened my door and asked him what he wanted. He started the conversation off by asking for my name. Without hesitation, I told him my name, which probably wasn't a smart move. He then sort of leaned and opened up my door a bit more. That made me feel really uncomfortable. With a stern look, he then said, ""Why you following me?"" Initially, I didn't know what to say. I responded, ""What are you talking about? Following you??"" He then said, ""Yeah, I noticed you following me around in the store."" I responded, ""I don't know what the hell you're talking about. I didn't even see you in the store. I was just grocery shopping.""

He then continued to accuse me of following him and kept leaning in closer towards my car. I then snapped and said, ""Listen, I don't know who you are or what you want, but you better back the f%ck up!! I'm not playing with you!! Step away from my vehicle!!"" I felt so enraged. My blood was boiling. I felt like I could physically attack him at any moment. At first, I suspected that he was experiencing meth induced paranoia, which is why he thought I was following him. But I didn't even care. I was just mad. I should also mention that I had a baseball bat in the backseat of my car, and I pondered on using it.

This guy then said, ""Whoa, calm down buddy. I'm only joking. You're off the chain dude."" He seemed genuinely freaked out. He then told me some sob story about how he needed money to catch a bus to see his kids. It was probably a complete lie. But I gave him a dollar anyway. And the weird thing is, I never give homeless people money...ever. But I was so mad, that I gave him the money, just so he'd walk away. I'm amazed how aggressive I got so quickly, especially with some homeless drug addict. I didn't even think twice. That guy didn't know how close he was to getting in a violent confrontation.",1
"I used to react a lot. But I have taken much effort and things have become a lot lot better. Still, I get angry when I am provoked. My main problem is my ADHD is creating forgetfulness.I forget a few times when provoked. I am in control 60 % of the time and I actually have learnt to give 0 fucks. But a few days backI got really enraged. A guy claiming to be a health inspector followed me as though I was a criminal. I had a spat at him on the streets. He said some provoking words.

I really need help on managing my very sudden anger outbursts, tips?

"I really don’t know how to deal with this anymore guys. Aside from just offing myself, I haven’t really been able to find a healthy coping mechanism. 

Sorry for being so melodramatic, but it’s the fucking truth. I’ve been with my wife 4 years, and we have a two year old, who is at the stage of testing my patience.

I can’t keep getting drunk, or smoking unhealthy amounts of weed, and just eating away my feelings. This shit is start to get unmanageable, and I can tell my wife and daughter are starting to notice it. 

I haven’t hurt them, nor will I ever. It’s me I’m worried about hurting. Not in like the obvious KMS way, but trying to self-medicate (former meth abuser) or picking a fight I won’t get up from. 

Counting doesn’t fucking work so PLEASE don’t tell me to count to ten. Shit has never and will never work.

"I haven’t physically hurt anyone in the past couple years, but it’s like I see myself yelling at people or sending aggressive texts, and I’m thinking about all the reason I shouldn’t do this. Giving myself examples of when I’ve regretted it. But I don’t stop. I just keep yelling.

Sometimes it isn’t as bad and I’m just agitated, but that’s just how I always am. I hate that I’m this person, that I snap so easily, but I can’t get out of it.

I use anger as a coping mechanism for pretty much all negative emotions, but every so often I substitute it for humor.

I try to guilt myself into stopping but it doesn’t work. It works when I’m getting myself to live, why not this? I hate how I act when I’m angry. I hate how I don’t feel like I’m in control of my body, how this has caused me a fear of becoming abusive in a relationship.

I haven’t even had a relationship and I’m scared of an abusive one. I hate this.",1
"My husband came from a very angry household. His parents would argue for hours on end and call each other names and cuss at each other. His dad was and still is an angry person he's very defensive and tends to go from 0 to 100 very quick. 
Because of this my husband acts very angry and does not know how to cope with how angry he gets. He hasn't been able to cope with how stressful and upsetting his childhood was. 

When we were first together he wasn't angry at all but over time with getting married taking on extra responsibilities and having a baby I've noticed his anger has gotten significantly worse. 
I stay home with our baby so all financial responsibility is on him now so I've noticed that has increased hostility as well. 

My husband talks about how he wishes he knew how to cope with what he has gone through and how to handle his anger and be a better father but he has no clue and I do not how to help. I enrolled us in marriage counseling to get a professional point of view to figure out how he can cope and how I can help him in a loving way. 

I would like some perspective from people who deal with anger issues. Does anyone have advice on how to help someone with anger issues and trauma?",1
"Title says it all. I am overall a very calm and relaxed person and very laid back. I pretty much get along with everybody and most people would be shocked to even think I have a temper lol but when I play video games its like I'm a whole new person and the devil himself has taken over me. I have this very violent temper mainly when I play FPS games or if I perform poorly in any game really. I blurt out the worst possible things that you could imagine, I've broken multiple items such as controllers, headsets, keyboards, lamps you name it. I am completely aware that this is unacceptable behavior and very childish and I've tried to control it for quite some time now and every time I eventually just snap at something and go right off the handle. I am able to play single player games without any problem really and if I do get mad its not even close to how I get when I play multiplayer or FPS games. After awhile it gets very boring only playing single player games &amp; a good chunk of my friends play all the typical FPS and multiplayer games, I work a full time job and only get 1 day off a week so most of my social life with my IRL friends have been through online games the last couple years as we all have different schedules or live in different cities now. I want to be able to play multiplayer games without raging out but I'm almost feeling like it would be best to just give them up for good as it would just be overall better for myself and others in my household.

I feel like I should seek professional help but it is also very embarrassing so I thought I'd get some opinions on good ol Reddit first lol.",1
"Hi Everyone. I've kind of been on a journey the last few years trying to get my anger under control. The problem I have when I get mad at someone who has been rude or abusive is that it stays in a nonstop loop in my head. I don't want it there, at all. It's like my brain identifies that person who was not-so-nice as a threat and starts trying to find ways to settle the score. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel that this is a practical way to live and oddly enough, it's like if I distract myself for hours playing a video game, the minute my mind is taken off of it, ""Your regularly scheduled programming will resume."" It comes back and it starts consuming me and so on. It's like it's some sort of survival instinct that I can't shut off.  


I want to know how to deal with this brand of particular anger. I do not want to be this way at all.

I grew up in a particularly hostile household and was not treated so nicely by my entire family and I was bullied a lot for being ""weird,"" as a kid. I think that maybe the root cause of my problems, where I reached a point in my life where I'm overreacting to people being jerks and so on and I'm unable to shrug it off as most people would. I want to be like most people so I can be a nicer person myself though because I feel like I'm turning into the kind of person who made me miserable and I don't want to hurt anyone.

"Anger is the only mental health problem that you are talked down to like a silly child when you seek help. See the first paragraph of “help” the NHS offers…

There’s a lot of information informing you of how to be safe from angry people dotted within the article, just to make you feel like more of a monster. I get that this information needs to be out there, but surely not in an article designed to be helping those struggling with their own anger.

"I work as a barista in an airport due to having zero qualifications. Although I am focusing on becoming financially independent, for now I am forced to live this version of reality in which I am currently stationed.

I am an existential man; in a constant limbo of disassociation and lack of reason; all accumulated into a force of anger within. And many a violent thought come crossing through my mind, ones that, if acted upon, would have me put in prison for years. For example, today, I thought, ""What if I just decided to react further to a customer that may be slightly pushing the line of respectful conduct.... What if I were to brutally murder him right in the cafe? How the rush would feel. How god-like I would feel.""

It's a contradictory thing to say, from the above, that I have always had a compassion for the earth, and a sympathy for the struggles we humans face day to day. But sometimes, a lot of times, I become vengeful, and I want to destroy the world for what it has done to me. I want to explode with this anger. I want to let it all go....",1

"I’m ashamed.

I’ve been terrible. I swore at my girlfriend, whispered like a psycho that she would burn in hell right in her face while she screamed after she told me to jump of a bridge.

We get in a crazy cycle. I know I’m not the only one at fault but as the man I know I need to lead. There’s no room for me to lose my temper anymore.

A week earlier I wanted to strangle her, I hadn’t slept because she keeps making noise and this night she started an argument that I wouldn’t hold her because it was so hot in the room. I got on her and shouted, I pressed her throat not enough to hurt her but to scare her. 

I completely lost control and there’s no excuse. We’ve just been on holiday for 12 days after the police came. Overall I managed to maintain control except one serious spell where she told me she would’ve reply to a guy who asked her out. I threw a bass guitar on the floor, called her names and walked off.

I’ve been using a method of visualisation to let go of my need to argue back, to call names, to make her wrong. She’s definitely aggressive herself and provokes me so I use this visualisation to let go of my anger, resentment and desire to prove myself right through anger.

I imagine in depth all the things I could do and I let myself desire them more and more, then I imagine that I just can’t to do those things which intensifies my anger, then I let everything disappear in my imagination as if nothing at all exists, not the situation, not the things I could do, nobody, nothing in the world of form and I be with that empty space totally. It’s been helping a lot, but I still have a long way to go. I’m so ashamed of all my angry outbursts. I don’t paint a fair picture here, lots led up to this but I need to take the responsibility and bulletproof myself from these outbursts.",1
"Hello I am 19 (M) and I want to talk about my anger related to gaming.
This has been reoccuring throughout my life since I was a kid. I do have ADHD, I didn't go to therapy for anger issues much and I've been off medication since 2012. You'll have to believe me when I say in real life I am a reasonably calm and collected person but when it comes to games I am a hot head and only one death can tick me off. It's only games where I see my anger as irrational. Most of the time when I get angry is when I die ESPECIALLY when I don't get even a second to react, I die instantly and that makes everything ten times worse. If I can't defend myself I lose my cool. I don't care about losing the game so much because I know the matches don't really matter. But when I die once or twice I get in a really bad mood. I play aggressively in games as well so its not like I'm scared of my K/D going negative, that doesn't matter to me either. What matters to me is the team and the objective and nothing else.

"Hello,

New to this sub. Yesterday I told my bf I want anger management. I already go to counseling for anxiety and depression, but I think anger might be causing my work problems and problems getting along with others.

Bf says I just need to learn to be assertive and not hold in anger when people piss me off. Thing is I don't know how to confront anyone and I don't like doing it. 

Example, I am a pharmacy tech. And yesterday at work a coworker yelled at all of us (her co-workers) and bossed us around. She then proceeded to talk about me (being the new employee) and blame things on me behind my back. Then the pharmacist called me stupid under her breath and she was very snappy about everything. Both women are old and set in their ways. The coworker is just a bitch in general she's bossy and talks rude to customers and co-workers but the other co-workers seem to just laugh and let her boss them. When they try to do that to me I usually try to defend myself, but it just leads to an argument. I end up hating my job and wanting to just leave. I hate the job itself but dickhead co-workers make it even worse. 


I seem to run into this problem alot and I have yet to figure out to solve it. I simply do not know how to deal with difficult people without getting worked up. I almost made mistakes at work because I was so stuck in my angry thoughts that I wasn't aware of what was going on around me. So far none of the distraction techniques really work for this. I get so upset that I can't calm my mind down to focus on my job. 

I told my bf I want to leave my job, but I'm tired of always having to leave or feeling I have to leave because of other people. I know I'm not happy being around people that piss me off though. It's beyond just ignore it like most people who work say because my internal anger affects my ability to concentrate. 

I do have to mention I'm in my third trimester pregnancy, I have had two car accidents and a slip and fall, I barely walk well rn. And I feel I'm being taken advantage of at work and doing everything myself so not happy at job in general, but this is how work has always been and people have always treated me in life. Very shitty. 

How do I fix this and stop leaving jobs because of dickheads?",1
"I know holding grudges is a waste of time and energy but it feels difficult to let go of them. Deep down, some part of me is too stubborn to forgive. I will keep this short. I'm not angry 24/7 but these grudges come and go. These grudges are based on things that people did and said to me. I have tried journaling (which works temporarily) and shifting my focus to something else. But a few hours later, these thoughts come back. I don't think I have depression ort bipolar disorder. But it gets in the way of my happiness a lot. I am a very kind person but when someione does something or says something I don't like, I find it hard to let go of it.

Does anyone else struggle with this issue?",1
I feel embarrassed at how out of control angry I get. I don’t know how to calm down and think reasonably when I’m in the midst of a meltdown. The only thing that makes me chill out is smoking weed but I also feel embarrassed afterwards when I look back at how intense I felt. Sometimes Im so angry I don’t even want to smoke because I know it’s what I need to have a better perspective but I dread the guilt and shame afterwords. Idk why I have to use cannabis before my brain can start thinking more calmly but it’s like I don’t have much of a conscious until I do l..which sounds horrible and makes me feel like a huge piece of shit. I hate being such a naturally negative thinker.  idk if this classified as a rant and I’m sorry if it does.,1

"I grew up with a violent-tempered mother who left me with a lot of trauma. Part of what she left me with is an instinct to rage. I learned to control it at an early age but I have always felt it simmering under my skin. I have many violent thoughts when triggered. It typically gets triggered by politics, particularly things related to my own trauma (I've had a lot of treatment for PTSD and made lots of progress generally.) It comes out in my ultraviolent fiction writing. But I've almost always treated people decently even when absolutely furious, so I had a bit of reassurance, ""Well, I won't be like her."" 

Now I am 36 years old, 15 weeks pregnant with my first child and I feel like I'm coming undone. I've been sick and stressed out for most of the pregnancy. I've been having a lot of behavioral issues with my cats and consulted a Cat Behaviorist last week so we are starting to implement changes, but my patience with the aggressive cat is wearing thin. He hisses and gets combative when he doesn't get his way and I'm a little afraid of him. I've been yelling. A lot more than usual. I tried to fix it by putting him in a different room when I'm eating at the table, but this morning when he crawled into the back of the closet, well out of my reach, and I had to go to work, I just fucking lost it. I screamed at him and banged things around until he ran out.

This is not acceptable behavior to me. I'm not sure what to do. I need to get a handle on this before the baby comes. Since this happened I've just been reliving my childhood and terrified of the person I am becoming. I would rather die than put my kid through what I went through. It's hard with my trauma to know whether or not I'm overreacting or whether things really are as bad as they feel.

Oh. I should probably mention I recently resumed a relationship with my mother after three years of no relationship because she wants to get to know her grandchild. I just found out she's coming to visit from out of state in three weeks. I should be happy or relieved or something but I feel completely numb about it. Could these be related? 

Thanks for listening.",1
"Traditionally, expressing emotions at the workplace has been viewed negatively. Emotions are thought of as hampering your ability to work well. In fact, most employees believe that negative emotions like anger must be suppressed at work.

This is because expressing your anger can lead to undesirable consequences such as conflicts with colleagues and/or supervisors. You might be viewed negatively by others and may find it difficult to adapt to the work environment. It might also interfere with your performance, as anger can diminish your ability to focus on your tasks.

So, anger is bad for the workplace, right? Interestingly, the answer is not a straightforward ‘no’.  Research has shown that both positive and negative emotions at work are appropriate as long as they are expressed with a sense of professionalism. Similarly, some studies have found that emotions at the workplace may actually be beneficial for both the individual and the organisation. The key is in expressing anger in a healthy and productive manner.

In fact, when anger is channelised and refocused appropriately, such that it is directed not at an individual but rather at certain factors or behaviours within the organisation, anger can  help you to express dissatisfaction and directly address the problem. This opens channels for improving problems in the system. For example, feeling angry about getting last-minute work can be a good thing if you channel your anger to talk to your supervisor and come up with solutions to ensure that there is some structure within which you can carry out your tasks. Instead of attacking your supervisor, your anger can be used to target and change a behaviour/process (not being assigned work on time).

Additionally, studies show that when anger is displayed appropriately and healthily, people at work are more likely to view you as competent, insightful and knowledgeable. For example, getting angry with your colleague who has not done their share of work for an upcoming work presentation - and addressing their behaviour with them - can show other people in your team that you have the ability to notice and speak up when something at work is amiss.

The key, then, is to not avoid or deny feelings of anger, but to address them in a manner that is beneficial and productive. It’s important to realise that anger is not an emotion that always leads to negative results. Instead, channeling your anger can help you understand a situation better, and  promote healthy conflict resolution. Anger need not be suppressed - but it must be managed well, especially in the workplace.

Here are a few techniques to help you manage anger at the workplace:

i. Take responsibility for your anger

To be able to manage anger effectively, you first need to acknowledge feelings of anger when they arise. It is important to be aware of both, the situations that make you angry, as well as your typical reactions to such situations. You are also entirely responsible for your actions when you are angry. Maintaining a daily journal can help you identify such triggers and your anger responses.

ii. Take a time-out

Take yourself out of the situation so as to calm down. In order to do so gracefully, you can say, “I’m feeling some anger about this (insert situation). I need a few minutes to calm down. Can we talk after that to resolve this concern?”

iii. Distract yourself

One of the ways to calm down when you’re feeling angry is to distract yourself with a different activity. You can choose to engage in some mindfulness meditation, focussed breathing meditation, exercise, watching a funny video, walking etc. Feel free to do anything to help you regain your composure and perspective. Make sure you come back to the situation when you’re feeling calmer.

iv. Be aware of your triggers

Think about what sets off your anger outbursts at work, as this will help you address the underlying problem effectively and avoid such outbursts in the future. You can try noting down your thoughts when you are feeling angry, and review these thoughts after your anger has subsided. Such an exercise will give you insight regarding the root cause of your anger, and help you address problematic thinking.

v. Reframe your anger thoughts

Be aware of your thoughts and rephrase any absolute thought patterns that you may be engaging in. Examples of absolute thoughts include, “always goes wrong”, “never works out”, etc. If you were to stop and think about this, you would realise that the chances that something is consistently negative or wrong is low; rather there may be some instances where things didn’t pan out as per your expectations. Instead of absolutes you can think along the lines of, “I’m feeling frustrated that things aren’t going according to plan. But, I know I can deal with this situation. Me yelling at everyone won’t solve this problem.”

vi. Be assertive

Anger may cause you to respond to frustrating situations by engaging in blame. However, the best way to deal with anger at the workplace is to user “I feel…” statements to present your own perspective of the situation and needs from the person. For example, “When you made fun of me in front of the team, I felt hurt by your words and actions. I would like you to be more considerate of my feelings.”

vii.  Be empathetic

When people are angry, they tend to become self-centered and only focus on information that justifies their anger. It may be a good idea to move away from that in order to arrive at a solution to the problem. After you have expressed your feelings using ‘I feel..’ statements, spend some time talking to the other person to try and find out why they behaved in a way that upset you. You might realise that the other person wasn’t even aware that they are frustrating you. In stepping back and allowing space for someone else’s point of view, you are opening the door for open and constructive communication to occur.

viii. Use Humour

Anger can be diffused with the help of humour, either in a conversation with someone else or as part of your self-talk. Finding a hint of humour in situations with others reduces the intensity of anger and allows you to gain a more balanced perspective. Moreover, studies have shown that not taking yourself too seriously helps you feel better, less angry, and less stressed.

Although expressing your anger may be beneficial, it is important to be able to express it in an appropriate manner. This will contribute to ensuring that the workplace remains a safe and comfortable place for you and everyone else.

 If you tend to struggle with expressing your anger in an appropriate manner, feel free to get in touch with a mental health professional nearest to you.",1

"Hi everyone,

Me and my friend got into a conversation, and he admitted that he has a deep, dark secret. Although he seems fine on the surface, underneath he’s a very...(angry? Messed up?) individual. He thinks he’s a monster who is going to rape, murder, etc... if he doesn’t keep himself under a very tight control, despite the fact that he hates rapists and pedophiles so much that he said he’d happily kill them. He also finds it very hard to deal with disrespect, to the point where he gets tempted to just ruin that person’s life. Apparently, he’s been this way since he was around 6 years old.

However, because of what he has to deal with, he’s attempted to kill himself many times from the guilt and fear that he’ll do something horrible. Therefore, I don’t feel like he’s a bad person, but he seriously needs a lot of help. I reckon it’s a disorder of some kind, though I don’t know what. Maybe to do with anger, but I don’t know. He’s going to see a psychiatrist about it. As his friend, what should I do? I fear that if I turn to any other subreddits, they’ll judge me for being associated with him. Thanks for any advice.",1
I've recently noticed that I'm slowly slipping away from the person I once was. I'm always talking shit or starting arguments with people because they have differing views from me. I hate the way I am right now and really want to change but don't know how. I can't find out the reason or the source for why I'm such an asshole now.,1
"This week I have been doing pretty well with my temper. I found music that works well for when I am driving (Spanish guitar, especially Ottmar Liebert), and I used the advice given to me by /u/wampacat , /u/napjerks , /u/GrowinginGratitude , and /u/pricklycitrus  to help. The deep breathing, putting things in perspective, and identifying what I'm feeling have been tremendous for me.

So this morning I was a bit sluggish waking up, but got out the door at a decent time. A couple of blocks from my house I realized I forgot my bluetooth headset. Very much a first-world problem, but my perfectionism and beating myself up over mistakes kicked in and I think it stayed in the back of my mind. I told myself ""It's no big deal, I have other options and I don't really need them"", and drove to work without incident.

At work, I have a 21-year-old co-worker who I do like but she seems very unhappy and usually responds with sarcastic criticism to anything people say. Part of it is the negativity that bothers me, and part of it is ""But for the grace of god, there go I"". I have a tendency to be that way and am really working to not do it because I know it makes people uncomfortable. I stepped behind her chair that she was sitting in at her desk to talk to someone on the other side of the wall from her, and she snapped at me. ""WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE JUST COME INTO MY SPACE TO TALK TO PEOPLE? I don't mean to freak out on you and this is the first time you have done this, it's usually her (points to the empty desk of another co-worker)"" and rants for a few minutes. I apologized and said I understood, and I would respect her personal space going forward. Then my victim mentality kicked in... ""But... she stood right behind me leaning on the back of my chair just yesterday when our manager was talking to us!"" I realized it was not productive to hang on to that thought and it is not bothering me any more.  What i have trouble with is having people raise their voice to me, as it triggers bad memories from the past. My anxiety shoots up and my ""this is unfair"" circuitry lights up, and my response choices to vent the buildup are reduced to crying and feeling like my life has always been shit, or attacking the person who I feel attacked me and giving it back to them 10 times worse to make sure they never forget the resulting wrath of crossing me. (Said humorously, as I know that the ""wrath"" and vindictive response are completely unhealthy)

Some other co-workers ordered Thai food, and I asked ""Did anyone get Pad Thai?"" I pronounce it like I've heard Thai people do so, kind of like ""Pod Thai"", however as I've often seen us Americans do, one of my more obnoxious attention-craving co-workers said ""Pod Thai or Pad Thai?"", pronouncing ""Pad"" in the American way, like ""note pad"". For some reason being corrected with the wrong thing just set me off, maybe because I was already on edge from earlier, and I sarcastically started saying in a very over-done Southern accent, ""Yeah ah wont sum PAD TAH with sum BUSCH LAHT"". Another co-worker said something about ""You're not feeling right"" and I said ""No, you're saying it wrong. Fucking ridiculous."" She started to say something about being southern but I just put my headphones on and turned on some music to drown it out.

In typing all this out, it has helped me vent the bad feelings, plus I am getting a more objective third-party view of my actions. I am acting very immaturely and unprofessionally at work. Just because others want to act like idiots doesn't give me a pass to sink to their level.

Thanks for reading my rants yet again. This is a wonderful forum and has really helped me a lot. I feel more awareness, acceptance and accountability, and thus more progress in having healthy responses to things and not holding on to resentments.",1

"I still have plenty of time to submit it. I just want to get it done early. I can’t seem to concentrate right now because of my anger.  I tried meditating for 20 minutes, and it helped during the meditation, but once it was over the anger came back.  Is there something I can do to be able to concentrate and write the paper?",1
It's like the emotional pain and hurt I'm experiencing is too much to work through so it gets immediately channeled into a spiral of rage. I need to work on my emotions if I want to fix my anger.,1
"I'm starting to understand and realize that I may have a fairly bad anger management issue.  At least more then I thought I did.

Earlier today I was out getting coffee with my girlfriend before she had to go to work.  My boss called me and asked me if I wanted to come in for some extra hours (today is my day off) because I had to call out ealier this week.  I told him I wasn't able to.  My girlfriend scolded me for not going into work to make up some money.  Thinking back on it she wasn't exactly mean about it.  More like a mother scolding their child.  Instead of being calm and realizing I made a mistake.  I completely lost it.  I started yelling and swearing at her and saying all sorts of very hurtful stuff about her health.  She very rightfully got angry at me and started to give it right back to me.  I don't blame her for this, any sane person would probably do the same.  
This goes on for about 15 minutes.  While this was going on I text my boss back saying I could come in I would just be a little late because I needed to get changed.  He tells me its okay and I didn't need to come in because he realized I wasn't trained to cover what he needed covered.  I **immediately** calmed down.  I stopped swearing, yelling, being hurtful.  You would think nothing was wrong with how I was talking.  Unfortunately it doesn't work that way for the recieving end.  My girlfriend is royally pissed off at me and is threating to tell all of my friends and coworkers how I really am as a person.  Can't say I blame her.  I kind of deserve it.

Heres's my problem.  When I get angry it isn't minor.  It tends to be extremely bad and abusive.  I don't have minor reactions to anger.  I don't know how to prevent this or calm down before I say something really bad (which happens more then I want to admit).  Any thoughts on how I can try to prevent the extremes?  Any thing you do to calm down quickly? I am starting to cause major problems I don't want that.",1
"First time post here, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, since whenever I feel bad I would just go to r/Depression, but I'm not depressed right now, just absolutely angry, ashamed because I've been humiliated.

So a bit of a story, I followed a forum for an independent game where updates would regularly come. But for the past months since earlier this year, no updates came due to the creator getting sick &amp; burnout, and said they'll be taking a  month or two break. Usually in that forum when the game is no longer updated the game will be tagged abandoned.

So months later and still no news from the creator, I fear that the game might be abandoned. Usually in this kind of forums the most annoying comments are the ones that always ask ""when is the new update coming out?""

But I didn't ask that, I just said that I'm worried that the game might be abandoned. But then another user facepalmed at my comment, and prepared a wall of text calling the likes of me an idiot, and even posts gifs because memes gets you likes, and he got a ton of likes.

And that's where my anger comes in. Being humiliated by the guy is one thing, but the fact that other people supported him/her and perceives me as THE idiot, it pissed me off.

But then I replied to that person telling him to chill out, but before I post, I exploded because of shame and pretty much wrote some meltdown towards that person. But thankfully I have some sense of control and decided to discard that meltdown comment because if I did it, it would further prove that I'm THE idiot.

Honestly, I'm still mad right now, but I really want that guy to receive his comeuppance for humiliating me. Which is stupid, because this is the internet, and internet shames you everyday. But man, how I wish I could do the same to him right now.

Or maybe I just made it for experiencing the ugly side of internet. Heh. Sorry for the long rant.",1
"So, like all of you I get angry.  I spend time thinking about things that get me angry.   I try not to, but I think my brain secretly likes to be angry, as its often an easy way out, or a source for a potential dopamine hit.  
I've had a little dying cat in my life, seems he has been sick for about a month; just quit eating, got weak.   I thought he would pull through, but he didn't.  I ended up putting him to sleep.  
When I think back to all the time I wasted being angry, as opposed to thinking about him, it seems like such a tragedy. 
Its too late now, for from now on, I'm going to give that time to those I love and lost.   
I've been working with this, and it really seems to help short circuit the pattern quickly.  Instead of trying to reconcile what it is that i am angry about, my mind is instead overwhelmed with the memories of my loved ones.  Its difficult to be angry in that state of mind.  
Good luck",1
"My mom and I don't get on well. Ever. She just jumped down my throat about something again, and I can feel myself about to lose it. She does this way too often. My face feels hot, and I can tell it's reddened a bit. My heart is pounding like crazy and I can feel this tingling in my hands and feet again.
This is what I felt years ago when I broke someone's hand before I could stop myself. I'm terrified that something like that could happen again, so I'm trying to stay away from her. Being this angry about anything is causing me physical pain, though.",1
"So I need some help dealing with people being disrespectful. It has a huge effect on my ability to hold a job. I either blow a gasket on somebody or some prick at the company discovered this is a trigger for me and uses it to get under my skin. 

I don’t tolerate being disrespected very well. I go into a rage and want nothing else but to beat the shit out of the person who has disrespected me. I’ve never actually become violent, I fear the consequences too much. I do however obsess over the disrespect and try to think of any way I can get back at the person without getting myself in trouble. I go to any lengths to make the person uncomfortable or upset. 

I’m sure this has to do with my father constantly criticizing and ridiculing me as a child. I was essentially bullied for 18+ years by the one person in life that I wanted to like me the most. Shit still pisses me off and now that I’m a grown man he refuses to even acknowledge that any of it happened. 

Anyhow, so how do I deal with this? Just earlier I was getting food on my off day from a restaurant I work at and I look over and I can see someone looking at me, talking about me to another co worker then they both have a giggle and look right at me while I’m standing there waiting for my food. I want to snap on this guy, I want to bury my fist in his face and teach him to never treat someone that way. Who does he think he is? 

I’m sure this scenario must sound familiar to some of you. How can I over come this? I hate dealing with the consequences of thinking this way but at the same time, I can’t let go of wanting to hold these people accountable for being such pieces of shit.",1

It is getting out of hand i do not know what to do.",1
I have been dealing with a lot of aggression when feeling angry. I accepted this as a problem a year ago and now my outbursts have gotten out of control. Physical towards my partner pushing  and shoving  and rude words. I am fearing losing my family. There are times when I can control it and times when I lose complete control. I love my wife and kids and I won’t hate to lose those that I love. I have taken hypnotherapy and regular therapy for the past year and I have yet to be able to control my aggression when feeling angry. In desperate need of some help.,1
"I’ve struggled with depression and anger for a long time. I’ve also been told that I’m a bully.

I constantly yell at my loved ones about everything. I get extremely mad at small things and blow things way out of proportion. For example, I just spent one hour screaming at my mom on the top of my lungs about how she needs to eat better, exercise, clean her room, and stand up against my asshole dad. A couple days ago, I yelled at my sister about how her she is extremely financially irresponsible and she will probably beg my parents for money in the future. In both cases, I know I was overstepping my role and acting like the parent, but I felt it needed to be said. Usually, I’m giving ok advice, but my delivery/tone/language are extremely hurtful. 

This self destructive behavior has seriously strained my relationships. I am no longer on speaking terms with my brother, and my sister keeps her distance but still communicates with me. I know my parents would be much happier if I just moved out. 

Has anyone else experienced extreme anger with their depression? Has anyone else been called a bully or bossy or overbearing? I need some advice about how to go about fixing this behavior and being more kind to others.",1
"This may be a long one, but if you’re struggling with anger, I urge you to stick around. I’ve learned a few things while struggling with anger and I’d like to pass them on. 

I had learned something after a lot of traumatic things happened all at once during my senior year of high school. My sister-in-law used to say (in reference to her own son) that she does not want her son to “grow up blaming the world”. When all of those bad things happened junior year, I thought about what she had said. Even if people have hurt you, you can’t blame the entire world for a few individuals. You can only do yourself a favor and take care of yourself. 

I have been angry. I have been mean. Sometimes my anger feels justified because someone had done something to me first. I used to feel like I was being a punk if I just let things slide. No one wants to feel like a doormat. There’s definitely be those who will incite your anger too. I use to surround myself with those people for a very long time because I never had to think twice about my actions. Why would I? My friends had encouraged me. Those people are angry themselves and will use your intense reaction to satisfy their own anger. Those who tell you to calm down aren’t the bad ones. They aren’t trying to belittle your emotions. They are trying to get through to you and they can’t when you’re upset. 

When you’re angry about something, the first thing you should do is ask yourself what you’re actually angry about. You should try to understand if that negative mood came from something earlier and just snowballed. It only takes one thing to ruin a day and we don’t realize it, so it just festers until we’re snapping at everyone around us. Most of the time it’s really just misplaced anger. It doesn’t always work, but I’ve found addressing what caused my anger and kind of coaching myself helps resolve the feeling.

Sometimes you can’t always stop the anger before that breaking point. You’re only human and as long as you actively work on improving yourself (not just saying you are), then you’re allowed to sometimes fail. It does not mean you’re a failure. No process can be perfected overnight. It’s at this critical point when your emotions are about to peak that you have a choice. You can take a deep breath and let yourself move forward. You’re 100% allowed to think about what has upset you (just don’t act on it), because suppressing anger is even worse than lashing out. For all those videos that go viral, we see people going with the latter. And it isn’t resolving anything. Their anger affects others and incites further incidents. 

I admit I still have bad outbursts, but I haven’t actually yelled at anyone for about 2 years. I’m patient with myself and my progress because I deserve happiness outside of the anger. Someone may still insult me, sure. That’s when my first instinct is to lash back. “An eye for an eye.” It doesn’t accomplish anything. It doesn’t make me feel better or you. It may give us the briefest feeling of power, but we’ll go right back to feeling small. Anger has an illusion of strength, but it just facilitates insecurities. 

Again, I won’t pretend I’m a saint with all the answers. I’m not perfect, but I’m better than I was by making small changes in how I react to anger. Honestly, giving into anger won’t make us feel better. It’ll give us migraines. It’ll give us ulcers. It will make people not want to be around us. I understand the anger. I don’t know if anyone’s ever said that to you, but I promise you when I say that I *feel* the anger too. 

My advice? Retrain your brain when it comes to first response. Every time you feel that anger bubble up in the back of your throat, notice how tense your body has become. Relax it. Take a deep breath and think about how insignificant whatever triggered your anger actually is. Sure, there are times when anger is necessary or when it’s unavoidable. But they’re a small amount in comparison to the things that often trigger our anger. 

No one really teaches this to their kids. Especially young boys. Whenever we had big reactions, we were told to act composed. We didn’t dissect our feelings and try to resolve them. We just put them away. If your parents weren’t extremely strict, you may have even been praised when you hit a bully back. I was. The issue with that is that they don’t really teach us how to process and control our negative emotions. They only teach us to hold them in for as long as possible until we snap. 

However, that anger is useless when it comes to small interactions, relationships, inconveniences, or whatever else triggers your rage. Constantly being angry is unhealthy. It will make you a recluse and you’ll forget all the good qualities about yourself. Anger hides the best parts of ourselves. So, remember that if you’re unhappy in life or you find yourself angry at those around you, it’s time to think about where that anger is coming from. When you find yourself getting tense, loosen your fists. Take a deep breath. Think about what made you angry and if it’s worth ruining your mood or making you do something extreme. It’s hard sometimes in the middle of the anger, but do those things first before that anger takes over. You’ll be happier. 

Of course, a therapist is always the best option. I also get therapy is expensive, some people don’t believe in it, or opening up is extremely difficult. These are things I’ve taken from my experiences and they have helped. Especially taking a deep breath because a lot of people tend to forget to breath when they’re extremely focused. My mom used to say people take deep sighs because they were thinking so hard that they forgot to breathe. Take a deep breath and take your control back.",1
"It is almost like an addiction. When I'm playing an online game and I get killed or think the battle is unfair I will insult and swear at people. Sometimes I find it funny just to insult someone if they were annoying me.

The worrying thing is it sometimes spills over into real life. This morning I almost lost my footing on the pavement and swore out loud in front of strangers before I even knew what I was doing.

I am angry as fk in real life. I am normal, fit and in shape and don't hate myself (i think) but have struggled to get proper employment since graduating and spend a lot of time doing nothing. I think the isolation has mentally destroyed me. I am bitter about it working so hard at uni and in jobs and I can't move on with my fucking life. Also most of my friends moved away for work or just moved on in life so I am isolated with no escape. I go to social clubs but it doesn't help much.",1
"Apologies if this doesn't belong here. I should probably use a throwaway but I don't care. 

When I say I'm hurting him, I don't mean physically. I'd like to say I would never, but I honestly don't know. 

When I get angry, it feels like this pressure inside me,  and if I don't release it, I'm going to explode. The best way to release it is to throw things, but especially if I'm mad at myself, then hitting myself works too. Screaming to a lesser degree.  And then the zen of cleaning up relaxes me. 

My husband has asked me again and again not to throw things. It upsets him and affects him negatively. I promise to be better but I keep doing it. My defense is always, but they teach kids to do this sort of thing so they don't hurt other people, he's overreacting. But I don't get to decide that. 

Tonight he yelled back at me for the first time. He cried. For a minute, i was genuinely afraid he was going to have a heart attack or something. He's too young for that. 

I need to be better for real. I don't know how. What are some things that help you?",1
"Almost every time I get angry, it's just a certain thought that loops over and over and I don't even identify that I'm angry.  I know I'm feeling anger, but I don't even have the thought of ""Hey, I'm angry.  I should do one of the things my therapist told me to do to get out of this.""  I don't even have the thought of ""I'm angry.""  The only thought I have is the thing that's pissing me off.

I am literally incapable of pulling myself out of this crap most times.

I'm in therapy, taking meds, and nothing is working.

"I know that I let people’s actions and words control mine. It isn’t an excuse. But I feel trapped, and have nowhere to go physically and emotionally. So I resort to anger. Sorry, not really much to say or ask for. Just trying to calm down, as everything just/is happening. 😪",1
"Now we’re on the verge of a second breakup, a second breakup because of the same thing but she clearly is in denial of her issue. What can I do for her to realize how toxic it is before it’s too late ? 

Obviously I take responsibility for some of the things I did but literally every disagreement turns into a burst of cursing, even physical abuse and sheer anger. Whenever I tell her that our relationship never worked because there’s this monster between us, she says “I wouldn’t be angry if you didn’t make me angry”. What she fails to understand is that feeling anger is normal, but expressing it by swearing and hitting your loved one isn’t. She can’t seem to understand the thick line between the two. 

Also her anger has driven us apart and now she literally feels like shit every time we have a disagreement, because we can’t discuss ANYTHING in a calm and civil manner, we’ve never actually done that. 

I really hope some of you can give me some tips to help us get through this. I tried to ask her to see a therapist, I even to talk her into a couple therapy but she gets so offended every time because, as she says, “I’m the only one to blame (for driving her crazy/making her angry”. She snaps out of nothing. 

Sorry about the long post :/",1
"I recently got a grade back over a minor speech in our class and it was a C. I was annoyed at first because I put a lot of time into it, but overall even though I heavily disagree on the criteria put in place I could understand how I did badly on it. 

But then I started to think about it a bit, and think of how I need straight A's this semester, and i started pacing around my room tapping my hands. And how speeches that were thoroughly bad with less effort put into them would score higher. How these people were placed higher than me and I was ""lower"". Then the outburst started and I broke a door. 

When outbursts happen for me they tend to happen when I just start thinking about something and it bounces around in the wrong way and I start yelling and eventually start hitting things.",1
"I can't do social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter anymore.

I had to delete my Facebook over a month ago because I would always get angry at something. Even the littlest things. I would get angry at the government, at communities, at the police, and at people I was ""friends"" with. I would make horribly hate-filled posts, and viciously call out people I deemed stupid. A friend of mine told me she had to remove me because of how easily I let my anger motivate extremist anti-govt posts. Who knows how many people have done the same.

I had to delete the already-useless Teitter account I had because of the same things. People would be absolute morons, and I would not hesitate to insert my two cents. I slowly realised that I am not a person that even I would want to be around when I get so ridiculously angry.

Aggression isn't something I'm partial to in anybody, which makes me question why I escalate to rapidly. The sight of something very irritating makes my blood begin to boil, and it almost feels like I get tunnel vision focusing on that irritant. Then I proceed to ""open my mouth""--as I could say since it's online--and the anger and the hate flow.

So I decided to isolate myself from those platforms. I remove the little Google headline things on the main page of anything pertaining to Trump, or the police, or stupid gossip bits.

If I stop focusing on them, my anger will subside, right?

I wish that was the case, but even something like some girl being a judgmental douche about breast sizes makes me want to create a new twitter account and freakin' rip into her. While the eerily intense anger persists, I'm at least getting better at picking my battles.

But it's exhausting. I can't talk to people that I thought used to be my friends--how can I know when there's no form of contact with anybody outside of work anymore? I bother my significant other when they tell me about people being stupid online, and my first reaction is telling them to tell said stupid person they're being a cunt.

It's exhausting.",1
"Most of my college friends turned out to be real pieces of s\*\*\*. They're arrogant bullies, they have nothing to show for in their lives, but for some reason they have an over inflated sense of self-worth. They take pleasure in putting others and sometimes each other down. I even did business with one of them a while ago, he turned out to be a real slime ball. I never confronted him about it, I just cut him off and moved on, but he's passive aggressive about it and I have a sneaky suspicion that he harbored the groups' opinion against me. I'm a generally easy going positive guy, but in that group, and where I come from, that's considered a weakness and a sign of gullibility. Except in reality, I've achieved far more in my career alone than any of them (they've basically never left home and just did the same thing since college, while I traveled and worked in many places around the world and respected in my profession). Nonetheless, they ridicule my life choices and opinions. They bring up politics a lot, which I wasn't really into until I started googling what they talk about. Figured that a lot of what they communicate is misinformation. For example, they make fun of me moving to central Europe because it's a place, according to them, for 'lazy communists and stupid socialists'.

I've recently left the group because it wasn't a healthy environment and I don't want to associate with these people, and I didn't think making a statement before I left about how misinformed they are would have been productive. I also never confronted that slime ball. I simply walked off politely and shut that door. I feel like I did the right thing, but I'm also angry at all that. I keep coming up with smart things to respond to them in the shower kinda moments. I also sometimes feel like I cut them way too much slack back in the day. It's a shame that they are like that at the end, since at this age, I find that I have no friends anymore.",1

" 

Why do some people get into a rage? Most of us at some time or another get angry. People who are prone to lose their temper, often talk themselves into a hole. This self-talk can cause real damage to the anger-prone person and their relationship with others. This self-talk is often based on false assumptions and misinformation.

Marcus Aurelius said it well, “How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.”

The truth is:-

**1. Nobody can put us down** or make us feel like worthless without our permission. We allow ourselves to get angry by-

(a) telling ourselves that the other person means to put us down

(b) believing that if they put us down, we must be insignificant

(c) Therefore we should react with anger to what we believe to be insults and put-downs.

**2. Rarely do the words or actions** of others have the sole purpose of hurting us. People rarely have a vested interest in telling us that we are worthless.

3**. Even if the put down is intended,** we can stay cool, and not get upset, hurt, provoked or angry unless we choose to. While we may like the other person putting us down, we can choose not to get upset over the whole thing.

**4. When we interpret another person’s actions or choices** (being late, buying a new car for himself instead of a washing machine for me, interrupting us and so forth) as commentaries on me, I am “Personalizing”. Such personalizing interpretations are nearly always wrong. People do what they do for their own reasons and these seldom center on us.

**5. Although we may not like someone else’s behavior towards us**, we don’t need to tell ourselves how terrible, awful and infuriating it is. Instead, we can tell ourselves that there is no particular reason to expect that others will always behave in ways that we consider best for us. The fact is that nobody is perfect and everybody does wrong on occasions, even to us.

**6. We do not have the right to be exempt from bad treatment** by others. We can only change how we react to it. Why should we tell ourselves that such things are shocking and really dreadful when in reality they are par for the course?

**7. Should we always expect that circumstances will always go our way?** If they do not, does it mean that all is lost? How we respond to these circumstances is what is important.

**8. We should not get upset** over this or anything else. Self-control is a choice.

**9. Why should we claim a right to be angry and upset,** since getting upset and staying that way harm us more than the other person? Why should we want the right to give ourselves ulcers and high blood pressure? Why should we want the right to be miserable because we believe that someone else did us wrong?

**10. The Bible teaches us to forgive** instead of claiming the right to be angry. Forgiveness to a brother, or to an enemy, for hurting us is a good alternative to remaining bitter or a long time.",1

"I guess I never saw it coming because it's less common for women to have this issue. I've always been a fairly avoidant person, and in my relationship this has come an issue because obviously communication is important.

 As I've been working on becoming less avoidant, I've realized the reason I avoid things,  is because at the core I get very irritated to the point of intense anger. I think I've always been reluctant to embrace that energy. But as I become more in tune with my emotions,  that anger has began to rear its head more often. 

Today I had an intense screaming tantrum(alone in my car) because my boyfriend forgot a relationship milestone that we were looking forward to. You can see in my post history. I was just screaming and hitting my car and balling. My ears are ringing and my heart is still pumping. I haven't had a blow up like that since middle school.
I feel scared of myself and yet still so angry. 


I've seen my dad become so angry at trivial things and laughed at him in the past for it. I always found it ridiculous. Now I'm starting to feel the aggravation of having to wrestle with that intense emotion as it takes over you. I hate it. I feel bad for ever laughing at him. 

 I feel like I'm always battling/ fighting with myself to maintain people in my life. And now this feels like one more obstacle,  one more thing that's wrong with me on top of everything else. I feel like I'm never going to just have a normal relaxed life.

"I’m a father of 2 great kids. Lucky to have them and a very cool wife who loves us all greatly. 

I can’t seem to hold it together many days when they misbehave. What starts as a simmering annoyance at things like not listening, making a mess, or them getting angry themselves and acting out, by the end of the day often turns into bursts of anger I just can’t seem to wrangle and control. I wind up shouting even though I’ve read all of the internet articles 100x by now. It makes everybody feel like crap, most of all me. I don’t seem to have other triggers, it’s always the kids not following expected behaviors. Starting to become (who i am i kidding, HAS become) a consuming and exhausting part of the day for everybody. 

I’m looking into counseling- tho I have a fear that I will happen upon someone who just isn’t that great or experienced with this issue and give me “blanket” suggestions. 

I’m also wondering if there is anything I can do to help myself in the meantime besides read the articles that repeat how bad it is to yell. I find suggestions like deep breathing etc unfortunately worthless, I start to breathe deeply when I’m getting angry already and it almost just adds fuel and a sense of failure, focusing the anger to a bright spark. I’ve written down triggers and thought about them for hours upon hours. The triggers are simple: kids don’t listen, and it drives me up the wall.

Another thing I’ve noted for myself is I often feel like the day just doesn’t progress as I feel it should. We often wake up, lay about, nothing gets done, the kids entertain themselves, I’m not pursuing my own interests, nor am I teaching or really entertaining the kids, nothing is happening. It’s overwhelming and feels like being trapped and not having an identity or purpose. I like purpose. I like to have progress. But I just feel stuck many days. I suggest things to my wife and she just doesn’t want to do them, so we sit around the house. This is where I feel like the anger might “stem” from.",1

So I just woke up, and after laying around for a couple seconds I get my phone and start watching a video, it's like about 2 minutes long. As soon as that video is done my mom comes into my room saying she's gonna start taking my stuff away if I don't clean my room or wash my clothes, even though I do both of those things (this is the issue of her thinking I'm irresponsible). She's aggravated that my room isn't clean, only problem is that it is, and the only thing wrong is my carpet is flipped upside down. She's also aggravated that I sometimes leave cups out at night for her to clean in the morning, okay. I admit I do that, been trying to put more stuff in the dishwasher, sometimes when everyone else has gone to bed I even pack it and start it, but I guess I get no thanks for that even after I tell her. Guess if I forget a couple times and I'm the spawn of satan because you gotta put 1 or 2 cups in the sink. So yeah she is aggravated that my room is ""dirty"" and I'm aggravated that she's coming into my room not even 5 minutes after I wake up already bitching and moaning about literally everything I do with my life. So I be a dumbass and not hold my tongue as usual, and I say her voice is grating and aggravating in the morning, and I question why she does this so early in the morning thinking I'm going to listen to it. Like she didn't even let me eat breakfast. The fuck? Pretty sure if she told me this AFTER breakfast I would've been fine. A little annoyed but I wouldn't have snapped at her multiple times, and I probably wouldn't have screamed at the to of my lungs at her with multiple curses and threats, either. I was going: ""What the fuck is the goddamn problem my room's perfectly fine it's not a place where bombs fuckin' went off with glass on the floor and shit!!"" and even after I say that the first time she still just says with no emotion in her voice at all: ""It's dirty"". So I continue yelling the same thing, and then I yell this: ""Do you WANT to get fucking punched again!? Well that's fine by me- let's get some full blown fucking physical abuse in this damn house since I've apparently done that already more than once!! Do you fucking get off on pissing me off!? Do you LIKE getting punched!? Do you get off at being punched!?  (The day I punched my mom was the only time I laid a finger on her since I was in 4th grade, back then I was STILL dealing with anger management and temper tantrums, back then when I wouldn't get what I wanted I'd kick the back of her car seats and get home and hit her in the stomach, once I took out a knife to try and stab but then I broke down crying and hugged her instead. Yeah idk either.). I hate how it feels like she's baiting me, and I can only realize I've been baited after I've already went off. She turned my phone off too (She has this thing called Qustodio downloaded on my sister's and I's phones. It shuts it off at a certain time, blocks certain websites, and my parents have full control over what we and what we can do, and at what time, so they can turn it off anytime they want.). I swear its like she gets off on this shit or something. Why else would she constantly try to aggravate everyone and make herself seem like the victim? She even does it with dad and my sisters sometimes. They'll pack away the food after dinner or put dishes in the dish washer when mom asks, but then mom will get mad at them because ""they didn't do it correctly"" which translates to: ""you didn't do it the way I wanted you to do it!"", and then rant to herself (we still hear it) about how: ""Nothing gets done right in this fucking house. I have to do everything myself. Nobody ever does anything around here they just sit on their asses playing video games or going out..."". Just imagine dealing with that everyday, as well as other shit eating up at you on the inside. It's no wonder I'm so pissed off at literally everything sometimes. 

The TL:DR is that I got into an argument with my mom almost as soon I woke up in the morning, she kept on ranting about how nothing gets done in the house when it comes to me, I get angry and yell and threaten her as per usual, she turns my phone off (also as per usual) and I conclude she's doing this on purpose because she does this other the other people in the house, with them also getting pissed off (dad and oldest sister) or emotionally pummeled (older sister, she usually just goes into her room when she senses an argument about to occur. Wish I could do that.)

I know some people on here have posted about feeling baited, and usually the answer is to walk away, but my mom is the type to always get the last word in no matter what, so often times when you think an argument is done, my mom will come back in like 30 seconds or a minute, even an hour after the fact with the same exact complaint to rile you up again. Anyone have some advice on how I can avoid getting baited and how I can avoid getting so pissed off early in the morning (btw after today's incident I tried to practice taking deep long breaths as another redditor and my therapist suggested. It actually helped a lot. Thanks!)",1
"Ok, apparently after my girlfriend broke up with me it was all calm and we stayed friends after. for some fucking reason some asshole at school really had the audacity to spread rumors that she left because she liked another guy... I promised myself I wouldn’t get in fights again after I moved countries and school, I’ve been a harmless usually happy person since then. But I really really need some way to calm the fuck down cus I honestly want to talk to this dude without any violence whatsoever",1
It's like I like being angry now. It's scares me that I like it. I love the feeling of pure strength and pure rage coursing through my vains. I feel like I can't live without my rage. I've been angry since I was 5 and im actually scared of who and what it's made me.,1
"This is my first post here. I'm a 17 year old guy, about to be 18 in 2 weeks, and I've been diagnosed with Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Because I have trouble controlling my rage, I've destroyed property, beaten my pets, and threatened to kill my mom. Any little thing sets me off, and when I get going, all of my empathy seems to leave me, and it's been getting worse with age.

I want to have kids and a wonderful wife someday, but I feel that unless I somehow get my anger under control, I shouldn't put a wife and kids through that. It scares me, because I don't want to have to be alone my whole life. I have severe depression, and I want someone else in the house to sort of watch me and make sure I don't do anything stupid, but I also just want someone to take care of and to talk to.

Unfortunately, I have very little control over my emotions, and therapy and medication haven't done diddly squat. I am trying to get better though, but it seems like whenever I make any progress, I for some reason allow myself to go back to square one. 


I just want some opinions of what you guys think. Any replies would be greatly appreciated. Have a great day.",1
"I've noticed I fall onto a spiral of something ticking me off, so I refuse to eat simply out of spite. Then I get hungry and even more easily frustrated, which will make me want to eat even less. I'll avoid social interaction, being productive, exercise, most of everything until I finally eat a little late into the evening. 

Anyone else do this? What do you do to help stop this spiral?",1
"Hello! This is my first post on here, was looking around a little. So I was diagnosed with ODD about last school year and I've been trying to deal with my anger and such, but every time I think I've got it in the bag, something always comes up and messes with my mojo (I like to draw and run my anger/stress off whenever I feel its getting to be too much. I also have problems with bottling up my anger at others). Now that the introduction is out of the way, I've been dealing with anger for much longer than 1 year, in fact I've had anger issues since I was four years old, temper tantrums everyday, kicking and screaming in my mom's car, hitting when I didn't get what I wanted, making threats, the works. Recently I've been going to therapy for my anger since I want to get better at controlling my anger (I'm 15 female btw). A couple days ago my mom and I got into another argument, this time about what I wanted for dinner. I had no idea and everything she offered I wasn't in the mood for, she started getting aggravated at me for not knowing what I wanted and I was getting aggravated because she kept on bombarding me with restaurants and questions not giving me time to actually think over what I wanted, then she started listing the cereals we had at home because she said she was done with listing restaurants. She listed breakfast foods and after I said I don't know once again, she said I was on my own and she was done trying to help me. This is where I mess up. Unable to keep my cool I yell that I'm going to punch her in the face. This isn't the first time I've yelled like that (in fact I was originally gonna tell her to ""shut the fuck up before I fucking punch you"" so at least I can hold my tongue in the cursing regard...), so mom didn't take me seriously and said: ""Go ahead! Do whatever you want!!"". That got me even angrier because she already believes I'm irresponsible, so my fight or flight response said: ""You know what? Fuck it! She's laughing you off as if you're some kind of joke! Go for it!!!"" So I get up, and I miss the first time and I see mom put this smirk on her face, so I try again and actually hit her this time. It really wasn't that hard of a punch. Didn't leave a mark, the impact sound was quiet as hell, weakest punch I ever threw. I didn't actually WANT to punch her but after I saw that smirk I just decided ""why not?"". Afterwards she looked really hurt, said she couldn't believe I could be so disrespectful and said she was completely done with me. In the days afterwards she really hasn't talked to me except asking if I was hungry, so I guess I officially fucked over my relationship with my mom for good.  The strangest thing is I don't actually regret punching her, in fact after I did I felt a lot more relaxed, and I was honestly more indifferent to the whole thing. I used to punch people who pissed me off at school all the time before I got therapy. In a journal I write my anger in, I wrote that ""I'd probably regret it tomorrow"" but I haven't, and I don't like it.

The TL:DR is mom and I were getting aggravated at each other, went up and punched her after she taunted me, fucked over our relationship for good, but strangely don't regret it or care that much about the situation despite wanting to have a good relationship with her.

Anyone else here deal with this kind of thing and can you tell me how to get better with it?",1
"I keep getting accused that I shout and get angry. But I don't even realize it. I dont even think it's shouting, for me it's normal conversation. DAE deal with this?",1
"First someone pisses you off and you want to injure that person. 

Next, you now have an assault charge and you're going to prison for a long time. 

Lots of people are assholes. Don't let the anger control you into doing this. You're better than that. Try to control your anger. Don't be a serial killer. You will regret it for the rest of your life.",1
How to deal when anger arises when someone has deliberately done something bad to you? Like they can abuse you etc but if you do it back then you got attacked?,1
"My arms are trembling rn after the latest bout of abuse she put me through and I just want my fist to connect to her face. I kinda just wanna beat her bloody and break her nose and reopen her knee surgery wound. Yeah, it’s messed up. I normally am not a violent person but when it comes to her I just want to brutally beat her. 

There were a lot of times where I did lose it and punch her but it was usually in the shoulder or something, and my dad held me back from doing more. I usually take the consequences because I don’t regret it after the fact because i feel satisfied after fighting back. I’m just not sure what would happen if she did this again and my dad wasn’t around to stop me. These thoughts scare me a little but there’s nothing else I could do to vent the reaction she incited in me. Talking doesn’t work, therapy doesn’t work. I can Grey rock all day and she’ll just yell, yell, yell all day. Until I snap and can’t take it anymore. I’m just a girl who’s tired of being put down every single day of her life.",1
"Discovered this sub just now, wanted to give it a try, maybe some people might relate maybe some will give advice.

Ever since I (M20) gotten into my teenage year i started having some very hyper aggressive thoughts on the little stuff, my little brother used to be an annoying prick that gets what he wants (now we're cool i guess), i overthink on petty stuff like how i threw a fit when one of the tomato plants i grew for a month is now dead cuz my dad watered it wrong (we argued for so long for something so dumb), how i generally hate how my big brother does his everyday things (get your life together!), how my sisters look down on me sometimes, and how my mom keeps pestering me about what to do everytime. Everytime these things happen i just want to say ""FUCK YOU!!!!"". 

My father told me once that i am very expressive about my feelings especially my anger, he said to hide my feelings more so i tried, but that just makes it worse unfortunately cuz now everytime i try to withhold my anger it just compiles in my mind and releases into a burst of anger with sometimes longer lasting moodiness. Every single time these episodes happen the after affects of it can be felt for days and i hate it. I think I've gone so deep into it that if there is something that can make me angry i will erupt and can't back down. 

I'm an asshole and I'm aware of it, I'm aware of it which makes me hate myself, i want to change but i don't know how, i can't afford therapy and that shit makes me angrier (FUCK!!!), I JUST WANT PEACE FOR FUCKS SAKE............",1
I haven't gone to bed earlier then 3am for the past week. i finally have my day off tomorrow and i got an email tonight about how they have to have me in tomorrow for 4 hours. i lost myself completely. i tore up a $ 120 headset for my xbox and put my hand through my lamp. i have no friends outside of school and all i do is kiss the teachers balls all day. i would never take our anger on a human. i just wish i got a day to myself to heal myself and comfort myself. i'll just have to settle for the weed and the crying myself to sleep every night until i get a day off,1
"So I just had a kind of epiphany: I've been angry for at least three years. Not the kind that explodes into rage, more like the kind that has festered, been let out in small bursts when I'm alone and that has now clogged up my emotions all together. 

My girlfriend and I are going through a bit of a crisis these days. It's not the first, but it might be the last. We've been arguing a lot over a long period of time, and the end of it was that we more or less broke up, because she was convinced that I ""had not loved her for the last three years."" To be fair, I haven't done enough to show her how I feel and just be present, and here comes my point.

I think that I have been angry all this time. Like I said, not angry in the ""I'm yelling and throwing things around"", but just me being resentful towards most of the world. My girlfriend, my friends, my family, my work, people that I don't even know - and, most of all, myself. Looking back, I can't even recognize myself in the guy that I see in the ""mirror"". 

It's been a tough realization, but at the same time it kind of felt like something fell into place. Like I figured out what was ""wrong"" with me. Now comes the hard work of letting go of it, which I really hope that I can do, because I believe that it will make me a better person. Does this make sense to anyone else? And do anyone have any experience with this?",1
"Me (35F) and my husband (36M) had a huge fight last night. We were getting ready for bed when he asked me to log onto our bank account and check something. He knows that I don't like doing anything financial related before going to bed, but he has been putting it off, so I agreed. I was mildly irritated at this point and he took notice.

Anyway, I log in to our account, it's a new bank account and the interface is totally not user-friendly, so I am getting a little more irritated because I can't find what I am looking for. It is pretty late at this point (around midnight) and I was really tired from working all day and had a headache - which he also knew. I do my best not to curse at the screen and successfully find the thing I was looking for. After that, I write a short mail in his name, with my husband's eyes glued on my fingers.

When all of that was finished, I needed a release from my frustration so I let out a whispered ""stupid bullshit"". And he said ""What do you mean, 'just a little bit'? And I reply ""Why would I say ""Just a little bit"", I never said that, I said ""Stupid bullshit"". And I admit, my tone of voice was pissed. I was tired, frustrated, had a headache and just wanted to go to bed. He said ""Wow! Stop attacking me! That wasn't necessary!"" and starts throwing things around. I said ""You are blowing this up, I was just frustrated from doing stressy things online that I'd rather not do before going to bed. You are making a little thing into something huge"". And he said ""Little thing??? For me, that is huge! You are attacking me! Stop attacking me!"" And I tried to calm him down, again saying I wasn't attacking him, just letting out my frustration. And then I saw him smirking and I calmly said ""Okay, if you are just going to make fun of me now, I don't see the point in this"". I slowly got up and went to the bathroom. I heard something break. He threw a mug against the wall with my face on it that he purchased a week after we got together. When I faced him, he said ""This is how you make me feel!"" I pointed to the broken mug and said ""And that's how you make *me* feel"" (I meant to say that he makes me feel broken into pieces). And then I went into the bedroom because I really didn't want any more drama. He has been that way multiple times before and I found out from past experiences that leaving the room and the situation usually calms him down. But not last night.

He started kicking against our front door. Our front door has a glass window and he kept kicking the door until the glass broke. He also said things like ""Whenever I ask you to do something, you are in a terrible mood! You never want to do anything for me!"" (I do, just not around midnight. I do more for him that he realizes but has taken for granted). I just let him rant at this point. It was one blame after the next. I'm sure all our neighbors know by now what a terrible wife I am. But I couldn't care less what they think.

I crawled inside the bed and pulled the sheets over my face, trembling in fear with our dog, who was also trembling like crazy. My husband came back five minutes later in silence. He started cleaning up the glass and the broken mug and when he was done, came into bed and started apologizing. I wasn't able to say anything, out of fear that everything would escalate again. And today, it is awkward to be around him. He is fixing the glass window right now, but I just don't feel safe around him. And I feel like I can't be myself around him, because he can't deal with my negative emotions. I never raise my voice or anything, it's just the 'tone of my voice' that triggers him, he says.

He asked me to find help for him.

What can I do in a situation like this? How can I help him? I feel like this is something he should do on his own? I know he had a rough childhood and probably needs therapy for that. If there is one thing I have learned about people is that you can't change them. They have to be willing to change and make an effort themselves.",1
"This is just a quick post to say thank you to everyone whose posts I have read. There is so much I can relate to, and I'm glad we're here helping each other, and that I'm not alone.",1
"I woke up today kind of feeling crappy. Allergies or something have been bothering me for about 4 days now and I haven't felt good the whole time. I did get a good night's rest last night, but still felt tired, probably from taking benadryl every 4 hours and just being run down in general. I made myself breakfast, cleaned up, and as I was leaving for work I told myself, ""No matter what anybody does on the road, I'm going to be ok with it. I'll leave it as their problem."" I have a huge issue with how people drive, and I really make myself crazy with it. Tailgating, cutting people off, going slow in the left lane, and a few other things really get me worrying about other people's business and I let it mess up my day. 

So I get on the highway, and it's packed as usual, morning rush hour, but it's still moving slowly. I'm about a mile from my exit (on the road about 10 minutes at this point), in the left lane behind a line of cars, and this little Cavalier comes flying up the middle lane, goes into the right lane to pass a truck going slow in the middle lane, which for some reason triggers me. Part of me wants to just go faster, but I also get a wave of ""why is this fast lane going so slowly"" thoughts happening. I accelerate and move into the middle lane, and see that it's wide open in front of the slow truck, and about 4 vehicles ahead of where I was in the left lane I see some middle-aged guy in a dually driving in the left lane, not moving over to let the people behind him pass. The people behind him had enough room to go around him on the right, and they probably just weren't letting it bother them like I was. For some reason I really feel annoyed with the lead left-lane cruiser, so I get up next to him, wait for him to look over, and I flip him off. 

I'm pretty conflicted at this point, because I've lost my cool, and I'm vacillating between feeling like this guy needs his ass handed to him for being a dumbass, and feeling foolish for letting something so petty get me this pissed off. The fact that I'm aware of it in the midst of it is progress, however, because in the past I was fully convinced that anybody who didn't do anything perfectly needed to be beaten into submission so they would quickly see the error of their ways. SMH, I have become my abusive parents.

I was able to reflect more about it, though. I thought to myself ""What made me so irritable?"" I then realized that I was ruminating on bad memories earlier. I had gotten back in touch with an ex-girlfriend who was very disrespectful, however seems apologetic about it now, and wants to buy me dinner for my birthday. I'm conflicted on that also, because logic tells me to just keep it casual, but loneliness and sexual desire make me want to believe that we may have a second chance. I also got to ruminating about my friend that I live with making snide remarks about things such as how I arrange the furniture in my room, or how she won't be firm with her dog and enables his crazy behavior. He's a good dog, he just pees in the house a lot, barks a lot when excited, and is in the habit of jumping on people, all behaviors that she reinforces without seeming to realize it. It's all stuff I can live with, but when I'm in my ""fuck everybody"" mood, I'll focus on the fact that she's doing something wrong and let it bother me. She also likes to leave dishes in the sink, which cranks up my anxiety about bugs and unclean conditions in the kitchen. It's all stuff I know I can learn to live with.

So my epiphany was that the earlier rumination set the stage for intolerance. I was tired already and not feeling good. I was repeatedly re-hashing things in my head that bothered me. That put me in a mindset to nitpick other behavior that I saw. Heavy traffic contributed to the stress a bit, and then seeing someone driving aggressively, plus someone else driving in a way that I felt was inconveniencing others, was the little thing that I allowed to set me off. I feel like being more aware of toxic rumination causing a negative mindset will help. That may be one thing that will really help me progress in making improvements with my behavior. Catch the bad thoughts, tell myself ""it's ok, it's gone now, we don't have to have that in our lives any more"", and then some deep breathing, thoughts of things for which I'm grateful, and any other positive memories I can think of. Thank you for reading my post. Let's have a good day.",1
So I've been having this issue lately where i get really angry and my first instinct is to hit either something or myself. I haven't really told anyone about it (only really mentioned it with one of my friends) and I'm only young as well. I've had minor anxiety problems in the past and I'm thinking that might be the cause of it? Listening to music really helps me and so does art and reading.,1
"I completely lost my cool tonight biking to my volleyball game when someone else on a bike cut me off. I ended up hitting their back tire with my front tire, doubling down when they asked what my problem was, and following the person and calling them names. I realized that I was en route to where I needed to go anyway; and around this time also realized that I had scared the every loving crap out of this person. At this point they’re telling me to stop following them and they’re going to call the cops. I tried to act calm and said we all have places to go. Eventually we pass a police station and the dude stops and tells the officer I’m following and threatening. I said “I’m just going to my volleyball game right down here” turns out the guy is going to the same place. Great. 

So my irrational actions now completely bite me since I’m now mortified to face this guy in front of my teammates after I acted like such an ass. I proceed to just sit in the general area of my game for 45 minutes and then head home because I didn’t want my wife to wonder why I was home so early. She can’t stand when I get angry like that. We had had a nice dinner before I left for the game and it just would have ruined her day too if I told her about it. 

I have been reasonably chill for a while but this was basically the worst case that I always knew these angry reactions could create - where I would actually have to answer for it outside of the vacuum I get in when I lash out like that. Acting like nothing else matters. I chilled out for that 45 minutes and biked home and am still just feeling about as low as I’ve ever felt. I’m hoping this will be the lesson it needs to be. Feeing a bit better but still just awful, awful. About to have a snack and watch some tv with the wife and I’m hoping I’ll be able to sleep ok :(",1
Recently I’ve been getting angry at work and I would get pissy.  This used to happen back then but I wouldn’t project it on people just my work.  And now I had an angry outburst in my dorm by myself and punched the door making my knuckles bleed.  I used to let out my frustration through exercise but now I barely have time.,1
"I got angry when a tablet with a screen protector, that was in a padded case fell 1 foot. Previously I had been frustrated at the work load with my current college courses, and learning a foreign language.

Any help is welcome and I am sick of getting angry at things that people can normally handle.",1
"Hey all, I've noticed that I get super angry when I'm in a situation that is against my liking. Like if someone says something snarky to me and I don't get back at them, or if someone makes something bad against me, or says something silly. I rush to either let it go in the moment or be tolerant and accepting. But later on, even days or weeks go by, and I'm still angry for not having a proper response. I don't necessarily feel like I wanna win an argument, but I wanna make a stand and I feel as if I don't, This makes me wallow in anguish about it and I feel like I lose respect of others.

"There's a lot of favoritism in my team. I don't speak up about this, as even my manager is a problem.

"I grew up extremely angry and hostile, but when I was being raised I was taught to be more calm. Unfortunately, now I rarely feel more than mild annoyance, even to things that I should be furious or frustrated about, like attacks to my character or coming up short in a competition that I care a lot about. This has sort of made me to be known as kind of a pushover and I can feel a lack of any intensity in me. I have no doubt I will be able to channel the emotions, but how can I find them within myself?",1

I have some pretty bad anger issues to the point of self harm. Everytime i try to get better at something i get angry and just cant control my anger. Usually i break something bit if my parents out home i will usually punch my head or bite myself. I just feel like damage needs to be done. I get so mad just because im not good at anything. No matter how many years of work.,1
"I used to have some spontaneous anger issues, but then I started picking up meditation. 
Now, I just feel no urge to be mad. The little things do not bother me anymore because in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter to me. I've found no reason to be mad.
Try it out, maybe try setting aside 10 minutes of your day to start. Also remember that meditation doesn't need to be a set time, you can do it anytime, anywhere, it's just a state of mind to settle into whether for 10 seconds or for 10 minutes.",1
"I just had an argument with my (61 M) girlfriend (58 F) a couple weeks ago over me completely misunderstanding her and getting unreasonably pissed.  She was at my house and we had been out to a nice dinner, which I bought and then ruined.  I was mad and  sent her home, I didn't want to sleep with her, we sleep together poorly and I knew it would suck when we were both mad on top of it.  Once she left, I realized I was completely out of line (realized I had misinterpreted her), emailed her a big apology and said I was stupid and completely wrong. We talked the next day and it went well, but it left a stain and that's on me.  

So I volunteer to go to her house the next weekend and work in the yard with her, we work well together and it's fun.  Her neighbor has a large German Shepherd that seems pretty vicious and barks non-stop, weighs around 100 lbs and is showing teeth etc behind the fence not far away.   The neighbors are out in the fenced yard, I can hear them talking behind the treeline, the day goes on. At one point, I am in the middle of her 1 acre backyard carrying stuff to the burn pile and I hear the dog barking and realize it's very close. I turn around and it's 20 feet behind me, on a dead run to me, in full attack mode. I freak and realize I need to scare him, so I run at him full speed yelling like a damn fool.  He runs back in  his yard and I am super adrenalized.  I know dogs well, I have 2.  So it's super irresponsible to let an essentially vicious dog loose. Had it been my confrontation fearing girlfriend, she would have ran or froze and most likely gotten bitten. She also takes her 2 year old grandson in the yard alot and that would have been really ugly.  I am sure the dog getting out was accidental but I nearly got torn up and I was supremely unhappy. I yelled over the fence at the neighbors (who were behind a evergreen tree line and were 20 feet away but out of view) that if that FUCKING dog ever came at me again, I would kill it and have Animal Control come get its corpse.  I yelled several times and said FUCK several times, which my girl friend hates, she's a bit of a church girl, hates confrontation etc.  

So because of nearly getting shredded, I lost my shit AGAIN.  GF is not happy. I don't think she understands being adrenalized but that is my thing, once my temper gets up, rational thought is over for a bit.  The timing was not good. I am trying to get her to sell her house and me to sell mine and us buy a house together, but I suspect she is having second thoughts.  I hate myself for this shit!",1
"I’m grouchier.  Ever since I was teenager people keep calling me the grouchy one and I hate it.

I’ve been told in the past to chill out, yet I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to just to do so.  I’ve tried meditation, I’ve tried venting on reddit, I’ve tried exercising. I don’t know.  Maybe it’s something genetic I got from my dad who has a lot of anger issues.

I hold more grudges and get into more fights with my mom.  I feel like ultimately she doesn’t understand what it’s like to me, and she doesn’t give me the time or space to vent in healthy way.  Just within 24 hours we’re have over five heated arguments.

I can’t find time to relax cause I’m either stressed, axious or depressed

I keep faking my mood until i snap. Most of what makes me snap i am unable to talk about or find the words for so I just have to say ‘I’m tired’ or ‘I need to be alone’

I fantasize what it would be like to be someone else who isn’t angry dude - mostly as awesome a comic artist that inspires me or one of the guests on my favorite DND podcast

I try to distract myself with arts projects, gaming, or social media until I sleep. I still can’t find a job to replace my internship where they have stopped giving me work and pay.

I always hate waking up. I rarely have any days where I feel excited, even on birthdays or vacations. I keep thinking I should have run away or followed up my suicide attempts sometimes sometimes .

Even when I try really hard to be positive, I expect the worst from people and situations. Thus I have started to avoid conversation and going out entirely unless it’s for errands.  I’ve even started to avoid my art communities just to come here and vent through a throwaway account.

I feel/worry like everyone around me actually thinks I’m stupid
When I try to discuss something I have a problem with I keep getting told I’m rude or argumentative. A part of me wonders if I really am that way, or if it’s because the other person is stubborn

I’ve have tried to act as a therapist for my abused mom ever since dad left us, yet all we have doing lately is fighting non-stop.

My mind is almost obsessed with revenge whenever I am not gaming or doing art. However what keeps me from acting on these vengeful feelings is knowing that it’s unimpossible or unlikely I will actually achieve anything good ( and probably end up in worse place for doing a bad thing)

As much as I try to fake being optimistic, kind and encouraging...deep down I have a dark side and dark thoughts and that keep telling me I’m selfish, I’m a hypocrite, and that i’ll Never be enough and am doomed to be cast aside by my friends and fans of my art.

But When I think about myself, the first and only things that keep coming to mind are my flaws, mistakes, regrets, and shitty choices (in the short term and long term)

I try to work really hard to tell myself I am not that negative person with some good things about my life. I try to tell myself to be proud and happy that I finished my Masters, that I still have friends around me and we hang out, that my mom is happy that I stay with her, that I paint amazing artwork that I’ve been told inspires others on their art projects, that even when I fall short of being good that I always can try to do my best in the future, that I’ve worked hard and have earned the right to play hard, and that I’m nothing like the monster I fear I am

But often times I keep wondering if Maybe I am a monster and I should just give up on life.",1
"It's been almost years since I'm venting anger by self-harm. I'm having daily arguments with my parents every time I grunt noisily and punch myself very hard. I'm pissed off not only at play but also at work, on minor inconveniences and mistakes. A wrong press of the button with my keyboard or grammatical lapses makes me mad. A new window pos up or my phone rotates and I'm pissed off. It causes my stomach to bloat and hurt every time I try to not react violently. Every time I commit a mistake, I go in a state of panic and anger.  I'm ashamed that I'm a pain in the ass for my aging parents. I'm struggling to change but my anger still wins. I already tried therapy from a counselor but I fail to follow her instructions. I don't find anger journal helpful since I know my trigger: ""making mistakes"". I can't get over from the instances in my life where I got scolded terribly by classmates, teachers, supervisors and project leads when I make mistakes. That gave me the reason to avoid committing mistakes at and I perform a disturbing self-flagellation for each mistake I make. My brain shouts at me ""UNACCEPTABLE"" every time I make mistakes and I proceded to grunt and punch myself to the point of pestering mg parents. How should I change my mindset? I can no longer accept failures and mistakes. There is also a part of me of self-sabotaging so that I make mistakes.",1
What is a good place to put my anger in to? Rn I punch walls and it hurts like shit(they are from concrete) and hand trainers etc or whatever they are called dont work?,1
"We’re on vacation and tonight after dinner was the most explosion I’ve seen. He got a little tispy tonight at dinner and said some things I didn’t like. I got upset and started walking back to the hotel and just didn’t say anything to him which I know set him off. We got back to the room and he just starts rambling off a string of hateful words to me. It escalated even more because that made me more upset so I yelled at him and started crying which made him more upset. The fight ended with him punching himself in the head several times and my foot being hurt. It was a really ugly situation tonight and I felt violated, abused, and afraid of him. I’m at a loss at the moment. I’ve set boundaries with him on what’s appropriate and what’s not. Things that absolutely cross a line for me and I feel like he uses that against me. Hateful, dirty names are the line for me and tonight he was just SO hateful and it all started because I was upset about what he said at dinner. I know that if I had let it go we wouldn’t be in this situation, but I don’t think I should have to and by pushing away my hurt feelings to calm him down, I feel like it’s just essentially giving him a free pass and he won’t take me seriously in the future. I don’t know where to draw the line because a lot of what happened tonight will stick with me for a long time even though I know he said it to get a rise out of me and a lot was said out of anger. He’s the best thing that’s happened to me most of the time but this is the 3rd or 4th outburst since we’ve been dating and it’s only gotten worse. His words sting me and they stick with me. When is enough enough? Is it anger or abuse at this point? I don’t want to be the reason he tips over the line but I also don’t want to just be walked over to make sure he’s not going to explode.",1
"These spells used to go away but now they keep returning more frequently. Whenever I get them I start imagining myself grabbing the people I care about and smashing their face into the floor. I was doing good for a year but now it feels like I can't control myself anymore. Usually I'll snap doing something like playing video games and start tearing my place up. Even my family notices I'm getting worse. I seriously feel I'm going to end up murdering someone if I don't do something. It went from almost no anger whatsoever to getting outbursts multiple times a day and it scares me. All my repressed rage from the way my family used to treat me growing up keeps returning, please for the love of God help me before I return to the monster I used to be.",1
"I consider myself to be successful. I have a great job, I'm going to college, I have a great boyfriend, and overall a great life. There is just one thing. I'm angry. I've always had anger problems. I went to therapy, moved away from my hometown, and I thought they got better. Lately though my anger has been back and in full effect. And anger arrived with all of his other friends (fear, anxiety,  guilt). 

I'm not sure if this matters, but I was abused as a kid. I was put on the backburner. I was unheard. I digress.  My anger stays fairly dormant until I drink. When I drink it can be explosive. I don't like that. I don't want to manage my anger.... I want to be at peace. 

I think alot. I think of situations that may happen and they make me angry. I get angry about things that HAVENT even happened. I need help. I want to feel at peace again. I want to feel happy. 

If you have tips, books, or anything. I need to get this under control. I need to get the positivity back.",1
"Why can't I control it? Why is it always trying to take over me? Every little thing that upsets me from my partner, drives me into a rage and when I'm that angry, all I see is red... It's almost like the good parts of me disappear and I turn into this dark person. It's been getting worse lately with life stress but I dont know where it comes from..

I grew up in a pretty traditional Italian family. Alot of yelling, fighting and being hit by our father as kids. Is this really why I get the way I do? Is it even possible, even though I'm now in my 30s?? All I know is, I don't like who I become when it happens...my heart races, my mind shifts into this dark place and I feel very alone. It's a cold place... It makes me feel so sad afterwards because when everything cools down, the realization of what happened sets in and I'm embarrassed of myself. 

I don't like.who I become. I hate what comes out of my mouth and I'm sick of it. Please tell me I'm not alone with all of this... Has anyone felt this way and has anything helped you? I'm finally willing to try anything at this point... Thanks.",1
"I also don't know how to cope with it. I am nearing that age of graduation where you are supposed to be close with your family but for me, situations arose which broke bonds. My grandmother who has taken me on trips and gave me some nice things for my birthday decided to be utterly rude towards me and my mother. Claiming that my Mum can't raise me properly, I never talk to her during the school year, and I am a failure as I can't find a job. She has always been condescending towards me, treating me like a subhuman with the mental capacity of a peanut which led me to not talking to her a whole lot. I still felt obliged o be all good to her because she took me on trips and drove me to Model Un conferences. But after yet another conversation of Grandma being rude and even going as far as to say 'You are going to wear a dress and makeup on your graduation night' my Mum said that we needed to cut contact with her. So now I am left with no closure to tell Grandma how I really feel about her and left with pent up anger from all those years of snooty remarks about me. I would love to have some closure but I can't seem to have it and now when I am alone I burst into angry tears and even burned photos of Grandma and I in them.

Some coping advice would be welcome.",1
"4 nights ago, I went through the most terrible insomnia. I must have laid awake in bed for 3-4 hours before blessed sleep took me.

The next day, Dad told the whole family that someone forget to lock the doors at 4AM (Dad was travelling and only reached home at that hour). He was so angered by the unlocked doors that he went to everyone's rooms and turned on the lights, intending to find the culprit.

Thankfully, he didn't lose his senses, and upon seeing that everyone stayed asleep despite the brightened lights, he opted to leave everyone be, and then he went to sleep himself.

I was infuriated when I heard that he went to my room to on my light, and that he had half a mind to wake me right there and then. I kid you not, I might have went berserk at him if he had woke me up.

For some weird reason, this thing has weighted heavily on my mind the past few days. I keep imaging the scenario where I was awoken at 4 AM, and how I would have punched him out of sheer rage. The dumbest thing is that this situation didn't even happen. My sleep-deprived brain thankfully kept me asleep despite my dad's actions so we avoided a nasty confrontation.

Why do I feel so much anger over something that didn't even happen?",1
"I really need help for my anger issues. It doesn’t particularly upset me myself, but apparently it does upset the people around me.

I have destroyed four laptops, usually by throwing them at the wall.

I have destroyed two Xbox Ones by beating them with my controller and then throwing it out of my window.

I have destroyed my television by throwing my controller at it before smashing the screen with my fists.

I have destroyed three phones by stamping on them, throwing them at the wall or blowing them to pieces with an air rifle.

I have destroyed two iPads by smashing them with my hands.

I used my desk as a punching bag for a period of a month, with my latest punch causing it to break into two pieces, after which I took it into the garden and destroyed it with a sledgehammer.

I have punched a hole in my door and punched out the wooden panelling in my room. 

This often results in minor injuries to myself and apparently great disturbance to those who live with me (who are sometimes the cause).

Does anyone else suffer with destroying things as a result of anger?",1
"So I’ve fractured my knuckle two different times cause I punch the walls. Literally anything makes me angry and do this, even if I can’t learn something. How do I stop punching walls when I’m angry?",1
"Warning skip the next paragraph, it is just me self hating.


I want to die. Die to relieve myself of everything. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I think I might actually kill someone soon, so I feel like it would be better if I died rather than imprison myself or hurt anyone else. I'm so done with everything, I can't even fathom how much I just want to sleep and never wake up so I can be done. Right now, suicidal thoughts are running around my brain and picking out anything positive and killing them. I know this was all over the place but if you could provide some feedback that would be great.

"Anyone have any techniques/tips on dealing with anger issues in a sporting environment? Generally a good guy away from the pitch but when on the sidelines I have an issue with dealing with poor decisions, especially when our players are at risk of getting hurt.

Players bailed me out with a solid win but I have to be able to walk away from situations and use my mouth to the team's betterment, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",1
"I have a thousand very good reasons to be angry with him. And a few hundred of those are the reasons why I *loathe* him.

But it's like an obsession. Whenever I remember something he's done, I'm so consumed with anger that I can't think or do anything. I get absolutely gruesome revenge fantasies and find myself wishing I had done something awful to him while I was still a minor and wouldn't end up in jail for ten years for it. 

It was so bad at home because of him that I would *gladly* have accepted some criminal youth program.

And I thought about it a lot when I was younger, that at least if I hurt him bad enough I'd get away from him and get the help I needed.

So yeah, my anger with him is an obsession, it latches on to even the most fleeting memory of something he's said or done, and I'm actually *shaking* because I'm restraining myself from doing something rash. A good day is when I don't think about him at all, that way the anger doesn't have fuel. But when I have down days it's absolutely futile to try to forget he exists, and the rage just swallows me whole.

I don't know what to do. I really don't, this anger is so consuming it leaves me exhausted and unable to do the most basic tasks. I walk around clenching my jaw and I can't relax until I take some at-need meds I have for anxiety, but all those do is calm my body, my mind is still raging and it's like a bad hangover the next day where the anger just comes back tenfold - repeat ad-infinitum. 

So I try to deal with it, but I have no clue how to go about that. I have talked about my anger with my psychologist but they haven't given me any tools on how to deal with it. I don't want to put a lid on it which is what I'm doing now, I try to talk myself down, saying he's not worth it, he's not worth going to prison for, I'm better than that, etc. 

But in those moments of anger the only thing I can think about is making him suffer. And it's having serious effects on my life, the slightest thing that reminds me of my brother just sets me off, and I don't want to explode on my friends or other family members for something they have no hand in. I just need help. I need to know how to calm down, I need to be able to try something to ease this.

I know talking with a psychologist about the root issue of the anger is a thing to do, and I have it on my list, but it's not something I can do right now, so please, how do I calm down? I've tried the breathing and the counting but all it ever does is enrage me more because I get pissed off that I need to do those sort of things over something *he's* done to me.

What else can I do?",1
"IDK if anyone else experiences this but. . . when someone gets close enough behind me on the toll road for me to examine their grill in my rear view and then pulls around me I get mad. Why? To that driver, I am being a serious problem. I am inconveniencing them. It especially irritates me when I am going over the speed limit already. I know everyone deserves the right to want to go 100 mph and do their best to get to that speed. At the same time, I hate being a problem to people. It makes me want to speed up so I won't be a problem to that truck that views the freeway as the American Autobahn. Sometimes, the left lane really is the most efficient way to get by slow traffic on the way to work. I will do 80-85 in the left lane. But I just can't do 100 so I sense the anger in the other driver mounting. Sometimes, they will move over to the lane to the right of me in a desperate attempt to get past me, only to get snarled behind a trailer. Then they get behind me again. I do my best to please the speedster but the fact that I am being a problem remains. At any rate, it's an instant anger trigger for me, especially when I am going 70 (not in the left lane) and they cut around me and and get in front of me like I am doing 20.",1
"This is my first post on here, hope i'm doing it right.

I'm a 19 y/o f and as unusual as it sounds, I get in a lot of fights. Every time I go out and drink, it's as if I have a death-wish. Yesterday a guy catcalled me and instead of just ignoring it, I asked him what his problem was and then it escalated into a fight. I'm not a good fighter, so I don't know what i'm trying to achieve here. It ended up with a bunch of dudes filming me and calling me El Chapo, instead of separating the fight. I just get so uncontrollably angry at the world and then the first sucker who pisses me off in the slightest is met with my ill humor. Point is, I woke up this morning, embarrassed as fuck, and I feel like the worst human ever. I haven't always been a violent person but I think my anxiety triggers it, I really don't know but yeah, I've been having these rage-outbursts for like 5 years now, and i'm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or has any advice.

Rather it be while im in classes or when im trying  to go to sleep and I get so angry like the person is right in front of me. I imagine braking them down   beating them to a pulp. I know I did the right thing by being the bigger man but why cant I move on ? I bet I couldn't even pick some of these people out in a line up but I can still remember how I felt.

"I'm 25 years old, out of college, with a full time job. Even though life is good, I'm angry at my family, friends, and everyone I associated with back in college. 

I'm angry because back when college classes were in swing, and grades were the most important thing in the world, everyone told me that working hard was the top priority. I was told to be diligent, focused, and never let my personal feelings or wants get in the way of the work. And I succeeded, everyone praised me for it. I'm more tired and angry than a 25 year old probably should be. I was praised for being this hard working machine, and I feel so empty because of it. What makes me truly angry, is that now because college is over... ***NOW*** everyone expects me to be this happy go lucky guy that makes fun and happiness a priority. 

Everyone expects me to start dating, going out on the town, having fun, being this fun guy that wasn't needed back when everyone wanted something from me. And that's the worst part. Why is being happy important **now** that the proclaimed ""*best years of my life*"" are over? And why do all the people that set all these high expectations expect me to be this fun loving person?

Now that all the school work is done, I'm supposed to shrug off all the work and stress that I went though by acting like a fun-loving socialite. If I did act happy, wouldn't that mean I justified all the stressful difficulties that other people imposed on me? Wouldn't I be justifying someone else's bad behavior and unrealistic expectations.

**I don't think there's a genuinely happy person in me... And even if there was, I don't think these selfish people deserve to see it.** 

Maybe my friends and family deserve to see me as this angry hard working machine. What if I stay like this for the rest of my life?

TLDR: I'm angry at friends and family who demanded so much from me, who are now expecting me to have fun and enjoy spending time with them.",1
"I started reading this book the other day on the train ride into work and today came across this under the subsection, Mindfulness of Anger. I thought this would be a good place to post it.

Personally I spend too much time looking for the arsonist and not focusing on putting the fire out.

I had to punch something I just punched some plastic things. Fist is bruised in side. I hate that. After that I had a breakdown. Idk just the smallest inconvenience makes me freak out.

"So I'm usually pretty good at suppressing my anger (too good probably) but the past few weeks it's been different. Been lashing out at people, having to focus hard on not losing my shit, punching walls in private.


I'm thinking it might be because I stopped taking my anti-depressants + mood stabilizers, is that a common result? It could also be because I'm drinking too much again, another possibility would be that it's caused by my Kratom use (I've heard about opioids making some people angrier than usual). Any other possible causes?


Anyhow, what's a good middle ground between completely supressing it and not being able to contain it anymore? I think about the consequences of my actions a lot, so I tend to not voice my anger because it wouldn't do much. I mostly stay polite and friendly even when I feel a lot of anger, I just let them know that it makes me angry but don't show it. 

I don't understand why I'm losing my cool currently because there's nothing unusual happening in my life, really.

So yeah, any ideas?",1

I'm a 33/m and have struggled with my anger as long as I can remember. I have noticed that this past year it has gotten alot worse mainly due to extra stress but still I need to find a way to let it out in a positive way.

"About a month ago at my sister’s wedding, the officiate “shushed” me during rehearsal. I wasn’t being rude, just trying to clarify one of my sister’s requests and I got “shushed” in front of a lot of family and friends. I got angry, said “excuse me?!” (definitely in an aggressive tone), everyone got quiet and the groom just asked to move on. Afterwards, I went up to the officiate and calmly told her I didn’t appreciate being shushed. She said “oh brother. Let me do my job, I’m damn good at it”. I froze as I was not expecting a grown adult to react in such an immature way and she walked away. 

Now, a month later, I still think about it. I think it mostly just bothers me that I let someone be so blatantly rude to me and didn’t do anything about it. I’ve debated “pulling a Karen” and writing a review in hopes that’ll make me feel better and help me move on but I don’t want it to be tied to my sister at all.  I also don’t even know if that would help.

I seem to get this way a lot, especially when I feel like my self-respect and pride were damaged. How do I get myself to move on or what can I do in the moment to let it go and not let it affect my day?",1
"This is my first post in this sub, I'm not sure if it's the exact place for it but I figured it qualifies as anger. I was wondering if anyone who struggles with anger gets this from a lot of pent-up holding in of your frustrations. For example, if someone says something to me or does something that I find offensive or upsetting I tend to just eat it which causes smaller things to make me more angry. I know I should be more confrontational or assertive and not allow these things to stew but it's not easy. It just seems like the anger starts to spiral once I've convinced myself someone's pattern of behavior is causing me harm so then every little thing they say or do starts to get under my skin to the point where I get angry and want to hit something or yell.",1
"Hello, I took a week of vacation because my parents are up visiting me from Florida.  I am getting very angry because not only do I have a pinched nerve in my back causing me pain,I have also been unable to spend my day(s) off so far the way I have wanted.  I am either being asked to help move stuff for my sister, or hauled somewhere with the rest of the family and my sister is having my parents babysit my niece here during the day.  Every time I sit down to watch TV or something, she asks me to watch a movie then starts crying if I say no.  I am also being asked to use my computer because my mom's work laptop is having problems so I cannot use my computer when needed.  If I say something, like I want to drive separate to go somewhere (my parents always take the longest route, never let me drive) they will question it and never want to accept my authority.  I am ready to just ask them not to come next year because not being able to decide how I want to spend my vacation time is bothering me. I really do not feel like doing heavy lifting for moving because of my back, but also because it is my vacation and I want to relax.  I kind of just want to tell them this isn't working out and not do this again.  I have expressed this feeling before and my parents will just try to say I'm being unreasonable/a jerk. I started smoking again because it feels like the only way to avoid the stress.  I notice I am also getting very impatient about even the slightest inconveniences whether that's waiting at a stop light, waiting for someone to call me back or send me an email.",1
"I have a decent grip on my temper, but it gets explosive under stress (having fairly severe depression and anxiety doesn’t help). I’m usually a very chill and friendly guy but when I hit the tipping point, it gets ugly. So ugly that I’ve lost two jobs over it, and got suspended numerous times in school.

My father (long estranged, thankfully) also has a temper like mine. I’m not sure  if I got it from nature or nurture, but it’s a part of both of us. I want nothing more than to be a better man than him, and I fear nothing more than turning into him. 

When I blow up, I feel guilty/worthless/like a lost cause. It’s especially bad when I blow up at a friend or my SO, or if it wrecks a piece of my life (like losing my job). That’s when I get depressed, which drags down lots of other things (quality of work; no enthusiasm for my interests; self-medicating; occasionally attempted self-harm). I then get extra stressed out because my outlets either don’t help me relieve the pressure or they’re outright harmful. Eventually the stress builds until I snap and it begins again.

I’m tired of my explosive temper damaging my life and hurting people I care about, but I can’t afford therapy and my schedule is too erratic for a support group. I need advice, support, techniques, something. Please.",1

"Been looking for a new job for four months after graduating with a master’s in policy and bachelors in communications;  even though I’m still employed, I’m not getting paid as much, not getting enough work to do, and unsure if I want to stay employed in the marketing industry for the rest of my life.

The job hunt has been super frustrating all summer; Either I don’t get an interview or I get one but I find out that the employers are jerks, someone ‘more qualified’ gets the job, or they are people who insist they cannot pay me.

I end up feeling the most anger towards my mom, my grandfather, and my uncle.  They are good people and deserve better from me.  But I feel like they are micromanaging me and trying to push me to do things like check out a certain online course or go to a career event or (in grandfathers case) start reciting prayers to get a job everyday.

Maybe they aren’t micromanaging me - and maybe Im just one of those people that needs to suck up to the reality about job hunting - but when I think about my job hunt (especially with my mom, grandad or uncle) I get frustrated at failing to get a job and the effort I’ve put into it...my thoughts lose control and all I want to do is end the conversation.  I’ve noticed I’ve been losing my temper more and just want to isolate myself from the world.  Reading fictional books, meditation, and exercise have been thankfully helping me cope

 But my anger has gotten to the point where I can’t answer the phone immediately if it’s my uncle or grandfather.  All I can say without getting angry is ok.  Mom and I have also become
More prone to arguments 

Doing art (something I’ve always loved to do as a hobby) doesn’t calm me down at all anymore - and it’s especially frustrating because I kept wondering if I’ve made the wrong career choice or missed out on an opportunity somewhere.  And I also I hate feeling this way because initially I did art to make myself feel happy and connect with people like me  - I want it to make me happy again :(

And I just want to stop being angry with my family, especially the ones trying to help me

I want to stop feeling like I’m failure for not getting a job right now

I want to go back to enjoying my art projects without constant worrying if I will get a job or feeling like I want to get away from

Just wondered if anyone has any success stories whereby they've sought help for their anger issues and it has significantly helped them and made a difference to their life. I am starting an anger management programme soon because I don't want my anger issues to destroy my relationship. Would really benefit from hearing other people who have managed to become calmer and less reactive/irrational. Or any tips I could look at using in the meantime :) Thanks!,1

Sometimes when I think someone is being nasty to me or think they're moaning or blaming me about something I get angry to the point where I shake and lash out at the person and even if I walk away I'm constantly thinking about it and end up shouting to myself swearing out loud how can I stop getting that angry and just let go?,1
"I have few problems keeping my cool when people provoke me when the situation is bearable. By ""uncomfy"" situations, I mean situations that make me more irritable (after an exhausting day, being in unbearably hot and humid environment etc.). I am still able to keep my cool during the first 2-3h in this situation, but longer than that and I lose my cool more easily, especially when someone provokes me. I just feel like I wanna shelter myself from the world and please just leave me alone for now, I just wanna be at home reading books or studying or even just going to my college class listening to lecture (where the situation is so much more bearable).

So far, I've managed to apologise to the people who I may have made uncomfortable by my sudden raise in voice (that's typically all the thing I do to convey: ""Please just leave me alone for now"") and they have accepted them. However, I cannot just say this to my coworkers when I'm put in uncomfortable situations. It hasn't happened, but I'd like to prevent it from ever happening. I cannot avoid these situations at times.

I know that there are a lot of people who can maintain their calm outer appearances even in awkward situations where I will not be able to handle. They say that the very first step is realization of your mistakes, but what's the first step to reduce these occurrences?",1
"Basically what the title says, my husband (26) has anger issues. He gets angry about every little thing from something I missed cleaning to our daughter crying. He even sleep talks anger.

He can be a real sweet guy, but jesus Christ his anger and stubbornness to fix it is really straining our relationship. I don't know what to do.",1

When I got up to leave she told me she loved me and I didn't want to say it back, but I did. I felt like I was gonna throw up and I don't know why.",1
"So I'm generally a mellow person with lots of love to give, but I realize I struggle with anger.


Two days ago at work I was filling out orders, talking to customers, and trying to keep up. I had 2 co-workers talking to me at the same time and I was unable to really listen to what was being said by one of them, I was focusing on what was being said for an order. 


One of the co-workers was talking about a girl who recently passed away during hurricane dorian. I accidentally told him ""what the fuck do I care about someone who died?""


It wasn't until later that I learned that girl(28ish) was that man's daughter. He agreed, what would I care and he moved on. Another co-worker told me that it was his daughter and my heart sank. I didn't realize who he was talking about and that he was just telling me about it. I later apologized about my disrespectful response and he said that it wasn't a big deal but I could tell he was trying to not make it a big deal. But that outburst(not yelling, but aggressive) was totally Inappropriate and I deeply regret it.


I want to make things right but these are one of those things I can't really take back. I said something horribly insensitive and I wish I didn't. I realized afterwards that I have anger issues and become inpatient quickly in a lot of circumstances.


I looked up a lot to george Carlin, Micheal McDonald, Marc Maron and other comedians known for angry outbursts. I've learned how to make things funnier, throwing in punchlines, and adding a wink to things I say in hopes that they are not super upsetting. But I realize now that the way I think and talk, I'll say something regrettable to a person I respect.


I am going to seek counseling for my anger issues but for now I just feel ashamed for the person I've become and recognize how my words really do affect others around me. I want to be a positive influence to people, and I like to think I am a lot of the time. Just not this time.",1
"idk whats been up with me but lately ive been so angry or upset all the time i just wanna scream. whenever i get angry now i scratch myself really hard, to the point where my arm stings for more than 20 minutes and my skin is peeling and sometimes bleeding. it helps me calm down even though it stings. and i keep on screaming whenever im mad. usually i am able to compose and control myself but now whenever something happens that makes me mad, i just scream and throw things and stomp. its like im an infant again. i know i do it and that its stupid but lately i cant control my emotions for some reason. i know i sound like a temper tantrum throwing baby, because honestly thats what im becoming. everyone always says im so calm and composed for my age (i try and be like this in public) but right now i just am so fucking pissed all the time, sometimes to where im shaking and i want to kill someone. i know everyone always says “i wanna kill someone right now” but sometimes i am so enraged that i want to kill someone. dont know what is going on with me. please give me advice, i used to be very calm but lately ive been having annoying tantrums and outbursts",1

"TL;DR - I get irrationally angry when my expectations aren't met. I'm aware of it and know that my best option is to learn to adjust my response to things, however in the heat of the moment I lose grip on rationality.

Hi. I'd like suggestions please. I've always had issues with anger, as long as I can remember. My childhood was not a happy one. To make a long story short, I have parents that look great from the outside but are very emotionally abusive and I was always afraid of my father beating me, although I can't remember him doing so. I also don't remember much before about 8 years old. My parents have told me that I would run into the room yelling at them to stop fighting, when I was a young child. Zero recollection.

I've done ok for a couple of months, however I get triggered by certain things. Usually it's traffic, as I live in a relatively congested city and we get just about every type of driver here. I also get triggered by what I perceive as criticism, especially from women. Could be a mom issue from when I was growing up, that I haven't resolved yet. She is still subtly critical and plays the victim to manipulate. I'll be 49 in a few weeks and I realize that it's time I grew out of that stuff, and am willing to put in the work to do so. I've made progress.

Today I really got set off for some reason, and I'm having trouble pinpointing what the trigger was. I had to make it to a meeting at a certain time, and I was waiting for my clothes to dry. I ended up leaving just at the time I needed in order to make it to the meeting in time, however I was feeling tired and a little scatterbrained, and I ended up going to the wrong library. Not that big of a deal, wasn't an important meeting, just a social gathering. I started beating myself up over it though, and then getting pissed off at various convenient scapegoats. My friend that I live with, the dog of all things...

Usually with traffic it's when I'm in a hurry. If I leave early enough and I'm not in a hurry, I just drive slowly and let everyone fly by. It's when I'm trying to make time that I end up with a slow left-lane cruiser in front of me. That kicks in my ethical superiority complex, and all I can think about is ""they should move out of the way, it's the law, keep right except to pass"". Once I get a chance, I fly around them on the right and cut them off to ""teach them a lesson"". Reciting it all now, I see it for the petty childish response that it is. My challenge is to reign in the anger when the adrenaline surges, and have a reasonable, mature response in the heat of the moment. Yes, it's human to get frustrated. The way I respond is very irrational, however, and sometimes dangerous. What if I caused an accident over my selfish behavior?

In relationships with women, I'm sensitive to any criticism. ""Why are you doing that? That's odd"" or ""I've never seen anybody put so much effort into something that should be so simple"" are a couple of examples. They were for small things, however I felt very disrespected and wasn't able to set boundaries in a healthy manner, because of my emotionally immature response. Instead of leaving it as their problem, and simply letting them know I'm uncomfortable with the way they're talking to me, I get pissed off and start sulking, usually restraining the urge to blow up and yell at them with the worst insults I can think of, to ""put them in their place"" or ""give them a taste of their own medicine"".

Today, I ran late because I screwed around on my phone for too long. I was trying to do something on Instagram and another app kept getting an error, so I did some troubleshooting to try and fix it. That get me started later on my laundry than I planned, and I ended up leaving the house later than I wanted. So I know the problem is me, I'll be better off if I quit screwing around with my phone when things need to get done.

So then I'm frustrated with myself already, and trying to drive fast to get to the meeting on time. It's only about 15 miles away, so even there was no traffic and I drove 100mph, I would only save a few minutes. Not worth the wear on my car and putting others in danger. That is not at the forefront of my mind, however. My focus ends up being along the lines of ""Why the hell are these people driving like such idiots?"" I become entitled and self-centered. If I'm going fast in the left lane and someone moves over in front of me and doesn't go fast enough, I get mad at them. I take it personally, and want to get in front of them and slow down, to make them ""see how it feels"" to have that done to them. And don't let someone sit a few seconds too long when the light turns green! Ugh. I need help.

My progress is that I accept now that it's me. For years I was convinced that I just needed to be around more competent people. Needless to say, I was often disappointed. I liken it to standing in the ocean just off the beach with my arms stretched out, trying to stop the waves. It's just not going to happen, it is much much bigger than anything I can control or change. In the last few years it has started to sink in that it's -my response- that I can change. Someone cut me off? Ok, I lose a few minutes of travel time. Is that few minutes worth what it does to my health when I get all worked up and stressed out? It definitely is not worth hurting or killing someone because I'm driving aggressively. I've lost jobs in the past and driven people away from me at work, where nobody wanted to work with me. I've gotten better, I recently had a frustrating time at work however I was able to talk to my manager and take a week off and regroup, and I came back with a much better attitude. I even got promoted shortly afterwards. 

What can I do when I get wound up that badly? Some things that I can think of are:

\- Just stop and step away from the situation. If people aren't doing what I think they should, then I can just remove myself from the situation (stop the car and close my eyes with some relaxing music, maybe), and get into a better frame of mind.

\- Learn to better anticipate that I may be triggered easily. If I'm feeling frustrated already about something not going right, I think if I can just say to myself ""This might not go right. That happens sometimes. It's ok. That's life. I'm going to be late/Not going to finish this project on time/Going to have to deal with a difficult co-worker/whatever else crosses my path at the wrong time.

The biggest challenge is when I don't catch myself in time, and end up strongly compelled to act like a child throwing a temper tantrum. Does anyone have any suggestions on, when figuratively the avalanche has started, the freight train has lost its brakes, what can be done to minimize the damage? I'm guessing maybe a less toxic outlet. Yell and scream in my car, cuss, whatever to vent the frustration, but don't drive dangerously. 

If I'm at work or with someone that does or says something that sets me off, maybe just close my eyes and breathe deeply, and tell them I suddenly don't feel good, which is true. If they press me about it, just say my chest is tightening up or my head started hurting or stomach feels sick. That may buy me some time so I can respond in a respectful manner and not tear their head off.

If you made it this far, thank you so much for listening. All day I've been thinking about who to vent to, and I have friends who would understand, and do give good advice about this stuff, but I had so much on my mind that I didn't want to vomit this stuff all over them. This was kind of like journaling. Just getting the thoughts out of my head and onto Reddit has been therapeutic. It also did a good job of putting it in perspective, as I could see it in front of me and see it for what it is, and it made it much more difficult to justify my behavior.

I hope you all have a great day.",1
Whenever I get angry I get a very strong urge to punch and/or break something. Doing this satisfies me and then I’m not angry anymore. But if I don’t then I just continue to be pissed off. I need something that I can throw hands at when I’m pissed. Does anyone have any ideas?,1

"I’ve been plagued with thoughts of idiots getting into my personal life trying to set me up with people and asking me to reconsider having children. It pisses me off to no end, I have no interest in relationships and having children because of my mental health. I just wish people would respect that. Thankfully I haven’t blown up at someone but it’s irritating.",1
"I don’t enjoy going to the doctor, at all. I never have because I hate hearing bad shit and I’d just rather not even know. So I haven’t gone to the doctor to be diagnosed for anything I’m about to speak on. I’m not sure if I’m bipolar, I have anger management issues or whatever else may cause my feelings/actions. The first time I experienced going to the doctor to be diagnosed, it was in 4th grade, my mom took me in for some bullshit test and the doctor said I had ADHD and ADD. At the time, I didn’t realize how fucking stupid that was... I was a kid. I talked in class and didn’t pay attention because school didn’t interest me and OH, cause I was a kid. My school treated me SO differently when people found out, teachers would constantly ask me “Did you take your medicine this morning?” (In front of the whole class) and the school said I absolutely had to join this class to go to for help with work. It was called CM for “slow learners” to go to and 4 teachers would be in there helping the students in that classroom with their work. I remember the first time I walked in that classroom, I was so fucking angry... every person in that room was autistic and a couple special ed (no I’m serious they were) and there were a select few that just... didn’t really care for school, and that was just it. I didn’t feel like I belonged in there but every single class I had, the teacher would teach their lesson and give us work... once I got my work they would say “Emery, do you want to go to CM?” (In front of the whole class, again) And I would say no and that I don’t need it. They would always end up making me and I would literally never go, I’d just walking the halls till I got in trouble. I remember as well, my mom and teachers had a parent &amp; teacher conference. I was in the room with them as they talked about my grades and how I fail to pay attention (this was high school now). I just hated school, I didn’t have the attention span to learn about things that didn’t interest me and I didn’t enjoy reading things I didn’t find interesting. They were all in the room, just talking about me as if I wasn’t even there. My principal, looked at my mom and asked right in front of me “Do you think your daughter may be special ed?” I looked up with the most ‘what the fuck’ face and everyone looked at me. My mom laughed? She fucking laughed and said “No, I don’t, she just has a hard time paying attention in school.” After that, I got up and left, I told my mom I was going to go wait in the car and that I’m not going back to class. I graduated school, I ended up wanting to go to a school to get my diploma faster because I was always bullied by not even just students but teachers, too. That was the best thing I ever did, graduating a year early.

The second time I went to a doctor to hear something I didn’t like, was when I was 22... I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, look it up.... the symptoms are ridiculous and I have quite a few of them. Hormonal changes are a very big factor that it’s played, upon many others. My husband and I have had trouble having children, when I see another friend or someone I know announce their pregnancy.... I get so upset. I scream, I cry and that’s when I really start just hating myself and feel like I’m useless.  

Ever since I can remember, I’ve had anger issues like you really wouldn’t believe. I get so angry at certain things that happen, like I’ll accidentally knock a glass over and I will absolutely RAGE and punch things or slam doors, I want to BREAK shit. I used to, when growing up, be so angry with myself that I would punch my legs until I couldn’t take it or punch brick... it had to be brick, I wanted to feel it and I wanted it to hurt. I do not hurt myself anymore, I haven’t since I was about 20 and I’m 26 now. I have had suicide thoughts since I was a child in middle school, I still often think of suicide and how much I hate myself/being alive. I just don’t want to be here. I have just one gun in my house for protection, sometimes I see it and stare at it just thinking “I really could just end it all right now” but I never would, I’m way too pussy for suicide but I still think about it... almost daily.  This has always been so hard for me to talk about because it scares me, because I don’t know why I’m like this and I don’t like it. I’m crying and just stressed as I’m typing this but I really need to get it out. 

I feel like when I get angry, I feel my whole body heating up and just boiling. I feel like and try so hard to just swallow it and count to 10 but half the time it will end up coming out. I feel like sometimes I have no self control of my actions/emotions when I know I do but I can’t help myself... it’s like in that moment I see red and I want to get it ALL out. 

Usually after, I abuse marijuana... I use it to calm me down, make me get in a better mood and it helps me with my depression. I smoked every single day, several times a day for 3 years because I wanted to feel better and happier. It not healthy, my husband hates that I smoke for those reasons and can’t deal with it on my own. I don’t smoke now as much as I did, when I do he’s not very happy about it and I tend to try and hide it from him a lot. I don’t like doing that but I feel now that I NEED marijuana just to stabilize myself and my mind. 

I need help, I know I do but I don’t even know where to start... I’m scared I’m going to go and hear something I don’t want to hear again... I’m fucking terrified. 

EDIT: I have yet and forgot to mention, my father also has depression, anxiety and anger issues. My parents had me extremely young, they were 16 and 17. I can remember like it was just yesterday when they got their first real place together. I know most people don’t remember things when their 3, 4 or 5 years old but the only thing I do remember is how often my parents fought and how incredibly angry and violent my father would get. My husband and I have been married 8 years... our first 3 years was nothing but fighting (thank God no kids around) and I would so quickly realize that when we would fight... I would turn into my father. I would break things, I would hurt myself to make my husband feel bad, I would scream and just cry. It took us almost divorcing for me to realize that I have to change or I will lose my husband who I so deeply just love more than anything. We haven’t fought like that in years, neither has my father with my mother because he literally has to be on medication to not act out. I, on the other hand, don’t sound like it but I have more control of it than my father. My parents fought pretty hard till I was about 20, it fucked me up I think, I think it made me think the fighting in a marriage was normal? 

My father has always had anger episodes and I was always there, ever since I was a young girl, to see them first hand. I truly think it’s something I got from him and developed just watching and hearing him. I’ve never talked to him about this, he would feel like complete and utter shit. He’s better now in a sense, his episodes are NOT as insane as they used to be. He has very small outbursts every once in awhile even on medication, but he’s been coping with it well and works his ass off to keep busy and from it taking over his life. I try to do the same, minus medication cause I don’t trust it.... I just feel like I’m not busy enough and I try to fill my time but there is only so much I can do and my anxiety really doesn’t help when I would like to get out of the house but I don’t have the drive to.",1
"I am generally a nice and understanding person, kind, gentle, I don’t bother or bully people I’m generally kept myself and it’s really hard to make me angry generally speaking. The only thing that really gets me explosive is when any harm is done to my wife. Sexually, physically, mentally. You do anything to her I don’t hesitate to murder you. When I say this I say it literally, I have such huge impulses, it’s like that part of my brain where I think rationally turns off and I don’t even think about consequences. I don’t care that I stab you or beat you till near death I do NOT FUCKING care.. I really don’t, anyone even dares to touch her will get punched. I’m SERIOUSLY explosive about this. She’s not in a good surrounding either.. Am I dangerous???",1
"When I get angry, it typically clouds my judgement just enough to make a wrong decision. I'll remain fairly reasonable, but when I'm angry, I *want* to pick the unreasonable option. Just today, I got fed up and I shouted and my girlfriend and her friend. Please note, when I lash out, it's never physically, but doesn't mean what I'm doing isn't bad. Every time I lash out, I regret it immensely afterwards. This time I felt especially bad, because my girlfriend is the person I care most about, and I never want to see her get hurt. She also has some past trauma that makes her shut down when shouted at, so I felt really bad for that too. She tried to assure me that everything was okay, that it's okay that I struggle with anger issues, but any time I lash out, I always feel like an irredeemable piece of garbage. I don't feel like I'm worthy of forgiveness. Just because I feel remorse, that doesn't mean I'm a good person. I guess what I'm doing here is wondering how I can get out of this mindset, and trying to find reassurance that I'm not an awful, abusive piece of shit. If more details are needed to make that judgement, that's fine.",1
"( Long post) 

17M here, 
I'll just provide some information and some questions that I'd appreciate to be answered. 

When I was as young as 7 I would from time to time bully kids that were rude to me. 

Age 13/14 I got in school fights. 

When I was in yr10 at age 14 I basically fucked up and looked like a big joke to everyone in my year, and was relentlessly bullied / ridiculed by 2/3 of the kids in my year level.  A year afterwards I turned to drugs for comfort. 

Fast forward to now and I have quite bad paranoia and anxiety issues (I take medication for insomnia) and I find that my anxiety always fuels my anger and rage.

I attend schooling in a new school in the city after being kicked out of my old school and almost charged for choking out a guy. 

Going to school in the city certainly hasn't helped with this problem. I'll yell at people or verbally disrespect them for slow walking, staring at me, getting in my way, etc. When I see people that look a certain way my adrenaline pumps and I get filled with ideas of fighting them, and I get extreme urges to engage in violence. 

It's beyond the point of just a teenage anger thing, and I need to learn how to control it, but I feel like it fits my profile and lifestyle.

Sometimes these angers get out of control, I've had breakdowns of wandering the streets hyperventilating, yelling at strangers, and I know I look straight up insane. Even typing this now I feel hatred and anger inside of me that just begs me to flatten anyone deserving of it. 

Having a girlfriend helps, but also doesn't. I never mistreat her in any way, verbally or physically and she really switches my soft side. But this changes when it comes to people staring at her in public, or guys harassing her or texting her trying to chat her up. Sometimes I get extreme urges to come down to her school and beat the living shit out of some of the scum that go there, hospitalise them, maybe even stab them, my anger feels like it doesn't have limits. 

I've also taken rage out on my self, I used to self harm by cutting, burning myself and now I'll still punch myself in the head on a daily basis when frustrated. 

I know this shit is really bad and it's sounding even worse to me now that I write it down, but it's driving me nuts inside and I just can't keep living like this. 

My questions are:

How bad is this from 1-10?

What are good strategies for calming down? 

Should I see an anger specialist / therapist? 

All responses are appreciated, and it means a lot if you read this far even if just to lurk, sending good luck to all of you.",1
"Well, as I’m sure it’s been said, I grew up in a very hostile and angry household. I’m 31 now, but I distanced myself from that as soon as I could as a young adult. I work on an ER now and the job is pretty damn stressful. People who need help that don’t want help. People who take up a bed just drug seeking. People swinging on me, yelling at me. I keep my calm for the most part. 

What gets me is my coworkers. Specifically the female ones. All the underhanded passive aggressive comments. The gas lighting. 

I confronted one one specific coworker today. She took a jab at me like she does literally every time I see her. I always ignore her, but she got to me today. I was already stressed from work. I asked her “What the fuck is wrong with you?” In definitely a raised tone. I didn’t yell or scream or anything, but I made myself known.  

I couldn’t let it go anymore guys. I felt like I needed to defend myself. It’s to the point now where when I see her, I kind of emotionally flinch because I know the jab is coming. 

Now it’s a huge email chain with all of our bosses. Her accusing me of screaming. She’s lying and making up things I never said. I left it at “I don’t want animosity in the work place. I don’t want to be harassed. I just want to do my job and help patients.” 

I feel like if I had a better control of my temper, I would have kept my cool. I don’t know. 

What do you guys think? 

A bit of me is worried I’ll get reprimanded for my outburst. There’s tentative plans to sit us both down and talk things out. I just don’t want to be messed with all the time.",1
"My dad and I struggled tremendously throughout our relationship. After my mum died he and I suffered at each other’s hands. The way he treated me when I tried to depend on him made me feel worthless. I fell into intense bouts of suicidal depression and for years repeated patterns of behaviour learned from him and repeating aspects of how I felt about him to other people.

At 24 I feel hardly like a man. I feel like a child. It’s too late to blame him and he has apologised for his past actions. As part of a spiritual experience I felt I was experiencing I made a lot of effort to do what I thought was helping him, taking him to get seaweed for his garden and taking him to see his childhood home. I did these things in the name of ‘growing up’ but soon found that spiritual experience not to be what I thought it was.

I am currently re-experiencing much of the anger from my past. I am having many thoughts about the way he has wronged me, despite trying to rationalise to myself that it is petty to try and cling to reasons to not let go. Admittedly, the scared child in me does not want his dad to die, and while I know it is something I will have to accept, I don’t want to repeat Stockholm like behaviour. I want to lay this chapter to rest.

I still blame him for a lot of my current predicaments even though there is not much he can do about it. He suffers from a lot of guilt as it is. Part of me is still just so damn angry though. It’s not a path I want to embrace.",1
"I had a very angry father, who gave me an example at a young age to be quick to anger, and be violent and hot headed. It is very much like a disability, as that is all I know how to do. It makes me feel very powerless. I at least need a way to make my fuse longer, because right now it is VERY short. I get mad at mundane things and become irrationally angry. I remember fights I got into many months ago and still get mad about them, and become very violent. I just want to at least have a longer fuse so I don't keep saying and doing things that I regret later.",1
"So, I do have some experience with this concept. I have actually watched a few videos on YouTube, talking about how anger is an emotion that is a cover-up feeling to defend from the powerless feeling of violation, but I never thought that I would be privy to it. (famous fucking last words) 

Recently, I've noticed that a lot of my own anger -- and I'm talking about that juicy, white-hot, hypertensive resentment -- comes from a place of feeling violated. 
And I mean that in the general, figurative sense, like a value, boundary or moral is violated, 
but I have noticed as well that -- despite never having been sexually assaulted or mistreated in any way -- I get a boiling sense of emasculation whenever my mother tries to touch me or ""helicopter"" me around in one thing or another. 

As a person who has a clingy, oedipal, elicopter parent, I'm often invalidated for my frustrations with this, and told that I should just appreciate her because she loves me so much, and unfortunately for both these hippie-types, and me, all it's really done is caused me to try and bypass, overlook and not truly process any feelings of violation. This has not boded well for my health, and psychological wellbeing. 

Does anyone have any tips/wanna commiserate over similar experiences?",1
I have a serious un-diagnosed anger problem and i just put my hand through a lot of wooden stuff on my desk. I'm relatively skinny I don't know how I did it. My right hand is VERY cut up.,1
"I’m so sick of my sister. Every time we talk about something that I care about or get into she tells me that “I don’t need your attitude right” as if she’s a fucking person of authority. Spoilers: she’s not and she’s just as attitude fulled as me.

She always acts like I’m being mean or getting angry when we talk about fascinating stuff because I get really get into what I’m saying and sound passionate about it. I’m not mean. I don’t yell at her. I try not to interrupt her even though she always, and I mean every conversation always, talks over me. If I actually lose my temper I leave, I don’t sit there anymore and try to talk when I’m mad because I know I don’t make sense.
She doesn’t try to walk away, she gets nasty. She brings up personal stuff that has nothing to do with what we’re talking about. She acts like a bitchy child that you wanna leave on the side of the road but can’t because you’d feel bad even though she’s not worth it. She does this so she can feel like she’s right and that she’s on top, but she’s not because she’s just as dumb as me.

I just get so pissed with her. I know that I don’t know what she’s thinking and I don’t know how she feels. I do know that she’s the most sensitive person to get offended by nothing. You could tell her that she has lipstick on her teeth and she’d take it as a personal attack. I don’t know why I bother talking to her, why I think she’ll be different or something.",1
"I am not trying to fix boyfriend's problems because I know I can't on my own. It's foolish to be the therapist when I'm not qualified. So I suggest solutions that he might use and leave it up to him to listen or take these up.

However, since no partner should be a therapist, then to what extent is helping them get through their problems acceptable? There are a lot of compromises and boundary protecting measures. Some people have helped their partners in their anger issues which is great, but how do you know that you're not playing the therapist?",1

"My anger is getting worse &amp; the toll it's taking on my boyfriend has gone from small bickers to him outright calling me mentally abusive which I think - no cross that, KNOW-  he is right, when he looked up the cycles the way my anger works ties in with it almost perfectly &amp; I feel absolutely sick to my stomach &amp; every time I get angry I honest to God FUCKING HAAAATE IT.
I hate how I get angry, I hate how I can consciously see out of my own eyes but my mouth feels connected to a completely different person. That the smallest minor thing will set me off &amp; if it slightly resembles something that's upset me previously I'll blow up &amp; say things I instantly regret &amp; don't mean but my pride &amp; the anger won't let me instantly apologize.
I just I don't know where to go or where to look, everyone has help for the victim &amp; I hate that now he technically (well no, not even technically anymore) is one because I haven't been able to grasp control of it. 
But everything I look up just shuns the abuser &amp; doesn't offer help &amp; I just. 
Reddit I need help. 
I don't want him to leave me or cut me out of his life, but I feel he may have to for his own sake even though that's the last possible thing I could ever want. I just want him to be happy, &amp; I know I'm not helping him be that &amp; it breaks my heart a little more each time. 
 Even though I love him so much but the person I am now to when we had started I'm ashamed of. I never thought I would become this &amp; I'm actually worse than the nightmares I had fearing the monster I could be become.
I need help. I'm sobbing as I write this because I never thought I could become this bad. Every time I become angry I hate it. It's my least favorite emotion &amp; the one I have the least control over no matter how badly I try to grasp at that control it's like trying to have control over it almost makes it worse.

"Just like the title when I get really mad and have no control over myself I throw things. My father used to do this and I hated it then now I am repeating the same thing. My upbringing wasn’t the best. Both my father and mom were abusive in many different ways, but I don't wanna use this as an excuse. I just think this could be one of the biggest factors of me being unstable.

"I've been told all my life to calm down, and let me just say that I was mentally healthier when I didn't care about looking like a fool while angry or whom I hurt.

I wouldn't wish ever having to hold in their feelings for any reason on anyone, and it's worse when it's actually justified.",1

Last night I got pushed over my limit. I don't know how, I was playing a video game, somewhat competitive, shooter. I've been playing for a year and a half or so and I still see myself doing god awful. consistently awful. spend 2-3 hours doing nothing but getting shit on and losing. I've put time into trying to learn how to get better, following advice of friends who are good, aim training, watching pros, and I still suck. it's not just video games, it seems to be anything with some sort of learning curve. It got to the point where I got pushed over my limit, blood pressure exceeded where it should have, I got up, clenched my fists, almost blew my forehead vein out by pushing out but holding my breath (idk if I even described that right), and ended up punching my desk, and then my bed a few times, ending my rage with pulling my belt out and hitting my back with it (I swear typing this out makes it seem far weirder than it was). I don't get these angry/rage fits often. I have only had about 3 or 4 in the past 2 years, the previous times were from school work, same thing, trying to learn, spend a few hours doing something, but can't seem to get it right. After the rage fit I thought about how much of a failure I am and that no matter how long I practice, no matter how much attention I give something, I still can't get it right.  I don't like getting into that rage. I don't like what happens during that period of time. I don't like being that kind of person. It really hit me afterwards when my SO got up and was about to leave because I scared them. It's time to do something about it. not too long after, maybe 10, 20 minutes, it's like it didn't even happen (to me). SO still scared, still unsure of what's going on with me, but to me, it's like nothing happened. What the fuck is wrong with me? how the fuck do I prevent this from happening? 

this is entirely a me vs me conflict. I \*\*NEVER\*\* would hurt my SO, or anyone else for that matter. 100% me fighting me.",1
"Hi idek how I'll type this because my hands and body is shaking from anger and my head feels light my breathing is shallow and I feel like going mad.
 
Please give some time and read my recent post about what I'm going through. Basically the part about my younger brother I mentioned there. He is a 13 year old junk. He jerks off every day, he is obese, he showers once a week, smells of piss, sits on his ass playing ps4 24/7. Apart from that now I'm almost 18....UGHHH IM TRYING SO HARD TO EXPLAIN THIS IN A CALM WAY BUT MY THOUGHTS ARE JUMBLED UP BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME ANGER I AM HOLDING INSIDE. So I'm almost 18 and my room has an air con and his doesn't, he brings his mattress in my room every night to sleep. His tablets volume is on 100 and even when I complain about it to my abusive parents they don't do anything. Apart from that he would randomly curse at me calling me a bitch whore....should I go on?. I want to die honestly. My privacy is evaded by this junk, my personal space is evaded, my so called parents don't give a damn.

From my last post you might read, he complained about me talking on the phone at night loudly when I was literally whispering to my boyfriend and from there the abuse from my narc mother started......ive been holding this anger inside since the morning I've only got a little out by cutting myself on my legs. It helps haha. There is so much going in in life, I'd appreciate if you could read my recent and understand where I'm coming from because I really can't type anymore. Sorry.

All I need is advice. Tell me how do I finally let go and run towards him and shred him to pieces,punch him slap him kick him and make him bleed  how do finally let go and break everything in the kitchen, why am I such a loser, why can't I get my anger out like that and GAIN RESPECT AND POWER THAT I DESERVE. HOW DO I GET MY ANGER OUT LIKE THAT HOW DO I FINALLY GO MAD AND CRAZY AND GET IT OUT, HOW DO I STOP HOLDING MYSELF BACK AND NOT GIVING A F ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES HELP ME I FEEL LIKE IM ABOUT TO FAINT.",1
"In a nutshell, a while back in January I was in the classic situation of best friend getting with the girl I liked.

The full story is I was in a sticky situation with this girl; she was toxic and abusive which I thankfully realised now and she was taking something out on me and one of the ways she did that was getting together with my best friend at the time.

It sounds petty on a surface level but what annoys me is a lot of things

1. She accused me of trying to use her as ""second best"" because I didn't get back together with my ex when everyone thought we would (was my choice) yet this guy did exactly that; he didn't hook up with who he wanted so this girl was his backup. And he had a huge go at me for it when he knows full well it's in fact what he was doing

2. He didn't feel bad about it at all. His ""Apology"" was half assed at best

3. He knew it'd hurt me and did it anyway

4. He knew she was treating me horribly but didn't stick up for me at all

5. He knew I was suicidal because of other stuff too and he just told me to ""Get over it, go talk to someone""

6. Pretty sure he's lied to others about me like she did

7. He's a sleazy piece of shit who cheats on partners and just wants to sleep with everyone and is super creepy about it, it actually disgusts me.

It keeps coming in waves I guess is how I'd describe it. Every now and then I'm reminded of what he did and I'm livid. I feel like punching something so I find a pillow or punchbag and use it but honestly? Not a day goes by where it doesn't cross my mind and because I don't really have an outlet for my anger, I'm worried it's going to come out in an unhealthy way and I'll say something stupid or hit him or something, I don't know. 

If anyone has any advice on how to process it &amp; come to terms better or any outlets I could find for it, I'd appreciate it",1
"Got into a argument with my supervisor tongiht over some side work and stupid stuff .

and now I get to enjoy the anxiety of knowing me him and are exec chef are all gonna have nice sit down talk about it tomorrow.

really thinking its time for me get out the kitchen industry :( fucking hate having trouble letting this go",1
"He can’t control his anger. The police were called to my apartment today because neighbors were concerned with yelling. He goes on screaming rages, it’s happened a lot before so I’m surprised no one has called before.  The cops were nice and just left when I told them everything was okay. 
But this did not serve as a wake up call to gain self control. He explodes at any little thing or any little thing I say or do. I can see him writhing with anger as it builds up and he can’t help but be loud or slam doors or hit things, etc. 

An argument got out of hand that made him start going to anger management a few months ago. He loves it and loves going but I think when the 2 hours are over it’s like he was never there. 
I am also pregnant and can’t handle the explosions anymore. 

What can I do?",1
"If your anger tends to have some abusive outcomes, then do you recognise yourself as abusive? *Are* you abusive? Have you tried to do anything about it and has it worked? What did it take?

Or: did you use to have anger management issues that you have solved, meaning you are ready to be in an adult relationship?",1
"If she per accident gives a tiny spoiler about a movie or game, I can get pissed at her. Or if I can't understand what she's saying, I get irritated towards her. But also if she makes a somewhat bigger mistake, I get completely angry at her and blame her for everything and say terrible stuff.

I want to fix this so bad. However she doesn't stand up for herself. That lets me know I can get mad at her without anything bad happening, leading up to me being mad at her. I just can't control myself in these situations.",1

"Alright guys and girls. I used to post all this on r/abusiverelationships but I think I need the story from the other side. Just to be clear, nothing clearly abusive has happened yet, and if there has been anything pushing my boundaries, it hasn't happened again after I said stop. Anyways:

He promised to get help for his explosive anger issues so he should be doing that within the next two weeks (which I understand is already ASAP as he can). He has not exploded violently at me ever, but he does unleash violence at other people. Just bullies which he has been dealing with for many many years. The main thing I am concerned about is whether or not he will end up reacting violently to me.

It is best that I step away, but as he has not tried to hurt me I think he should have a chance. There are however some things I am confused about that I hope you reader can help with:

* I think he lacks any empathy for the bullies he assaults and feels good about the action of punching them. He seems to be aware that it makes him an asshole and it will not help him find any jobs in the long run. However he sees violence as a legitimate solution since they leave him alone after that.
* He says he'll tell the counsellor ""I want to stop hurting people"", but I'm not sure if this is just to satisfy me since he feels good hurting people who hurt him. As for the secondary leaving certificate course he is entering (and I am already in) he sees that he has to really control his behaviour if he wants to stay in that course. But then again, I don't think he really sees how much of a problem it really is.
* For some reason he does not lash out at teachers, parents or other adults even if they anger him. He will rant about it to me.
* I hate his raising his voice because that's what my mother does before she starts to verbally abuse me. I also hate seeing him swearing. But when he is angry he will shout and swear, and I do tell him to stop (which he does after I give him a cooldown) but the next time he is angry it will happen again. Some people say this constitutes as abuse, some don't think so. I am unsure.
* Somehow he thinks his ranting hurts me. It doesn't because I understand that ranting helps people cool down. So he thinks that because of this he is abusive. The issue is just the shouting and swearing.
* **I'm not sure if forcing him to look for anger management is a solution. In some cases, therapy only works if you see that you really have to change. If he does not see the gravity of his own problems I think he won't get any better. Even having forced him into therapy.**
* He said that he doesn't think he will hurt me, and he has not tried to. But given his problems there is always a chance that he may. I wonder if any of you can give insight on this.
* Do any of you think that there's anything that sets you apart from an abuser in a relationship? And if so why?

Thanks. Would appreciate help.",1

"So I've been trying to work on my own anger issues for a bit now, a lot of times failing moreso than succeeding...and I've noticed a pattern with my whole behavior on how/why I get angry: I seem to seek out things, whether political or otherwise, that will stir my anger up, and then I'll keep looking for more and more things, until finally my rage is in full effect. I realized that its not even really a conscious thing, I tend to just do it and stir myself up over trivial shit...and its my own fault, because I seek that kind of stuff. What the hell is wrong with me? Do I have an ADDICTION to anger?! I caught myself today and was asking myself ""what the hell is going on here? WHY Am I doing this without any real reason?"" and had to pinch myself HARD to stop myself.

"Ok, I feel sometimes anger, but not so much, I am a person quite capable to manage my anger.

But I live with my husband, who had difficult childhood and a lot of anger hidden away..

He can manage to control this.. but sometimes.. there is this great big ball of energy that just pops out..

I can relate it to the dragon story...

There was this boy...a very sweet and soft boy...who liked playing with his toys...
But.. now and then.. somethinh happened, and inside he felt he was changing..
He was changing into a DRAGON.. and as he changed into a dragon, he could less and less understand the words people were, lovingly, or not lovingly , saying to him..
Because.. little boys understand human language.. but dragons.. they only understand dragon language!
And when he was a full dragon.. he does what dragons do.. kick and destroy and spit fire to everything that is near, and once loved...
Untill the moment their was no energy left...then the dragon slowly dissapeared, and the little boy showed up, once again.. to see the path of destruction the dragon caused.. maybe his favorite toys would be broken, maybe his most beloved mom would be hurt..
Maybe some glue would be enough, and a kiss and cuddle to his mom
But maybe the toy was forever broken and the beloved one would have a scar...



This is my question.. what do I do, when my husband becomes the dragon.. 
Am I the favorite toy..
Is glue enough
Will I , perhaps once, be broken forever..


I put this here, because a lot of people understand anger here, I feel their is less judgement for people staying with angry people and not giving up..
In relationship topic abuse us a quicky spoken word, and yes, in some kind of way..it is abuse..

But I am loving, gentle and forgiving, and very understanding..
I do also want to take care of myself and make healthy decisions for myself...

Angry people..how do you wish to be approached when angry and after? Any tips, advice, to keep loved once safe..
Which actions help with anger management..
Anything that is helpfull is welcome..

"I don't really post on reddit at all but I've been having trouble recently so I thought I'd give it a shot posting here. I've always been angry, the kind that's wayyy deep down, so far down my closest friends and family have never even heard me raise my voice or even physically lash out in anyway. I'm angry at the world for being so awful, I'm angry at people for not caring, I'm angry at myself because I thought the reason I haven't done anything with my life is because I didn't want to be a part of this world but recently I'm starting to think I've been wrong. The real reason I haven't done anything with my life is because I don't want to do anything of those things. I've always looked at people kind of like ""meat"", they mean next to nothing until they speak or act, I'm seeing more and more meat doing terrible things, and getting away with it. Not just getting away with it, but protected by those in positions of power, when it's obvious they deserve to be brought to justice for what they did. Now I'm thinking justice isn't done by institutions, it's not done by lawyers, cops, judges, prisons etc. So shouldn't it be done by someone willing to take on all that darkness themselves? Someone who can control it as they bring retribution to those who have been released by the same system we trust to protect and serve? I don't know if someone who kills someone else deserves to die themselves, I suppose circumstances matter a lot, but some meat is obviously rotten and leaving it out in the world will only spoil what's left. I'm sorry if this seems ranty and ravy (not words i know) but I just needed somewhere to get my thoughts down.

"At work I deal with machines that are automated to make parts themselves, which my job is to watch them and make sure they run right and check the parts they make. I work the night shift so there is more of a chance for me to be pissed off. Here I couldnt go on a break since I had to get the parts put on a reel. Any slight bend, smudge or grease from fingers on them automatically voids them to be bad. So I was putting the parts on a reel and constantly one thing after another the machine would shut off while I am holding the parts up with a pair of gloves on. And I had nobody to help me. I took a piece of tape and taped the parts to the side of the reel until I could figure it out. I must've had to fix the issue over 100 times within an hour alone. And I eventually outbursted and slammed the door as hard as I could without realizing it. Since then my coworkers have been murmuring to each other while looking right at me. This has happened so many times before. I have no idea how to handle it or control it. The moment I think I'm getting better it happens to me again where I get so angry I forget where I am and act impulsively. How would anyone assess this? I've been in countless therapy sessions and have been hospitalized numerous times due to my emotional problems and mental health issues.

I struggle with constant anger issues. I get most mad when i cant do my passion good enough and i get frustrated. It is my art which i love most it is the thing i do most. it is passion it is the best thing people do. I read this reddit /r/ and i want help but am scared. so i talk now and ask for help.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate myself i get so mad i punch things and curse and scream like a devil. its horrible i hate i do this. I want nothing but to stop myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do therapy but it is hard to get if you dont have money where i am. also i am scared of telling my past to stranger who cant understand for reasons i write. 

&amp;#x200B;

My anger comes from my farther and his own issues such as killing people in the army which is why he drinks alcohol. When he drinks alcohol he gets angery and messes up situations and so he drinks again. and again it is a cycle. He did this before i was born so it was my life. My mother got sick and we did not always have money so a lot of stress. They split when i was little. You do not choose these things and it is life you get i am not mad about past, it can not change so do no try to change past. Like writting in rock. It is done.

&amp;#x200B;

My anger is like his and i hate it, i have never hit anyone who did not hit me first. i am not  like him all but much like him in this way. also. So much anger at me not others. I wait until i go home and get anger at self not at others now.

&amp;#x200B;

This was not how things have been forever.

&amp;#x200B;

When i was teenager i was so mad at everything life and everyone. I lived in small town and everyone talk about you and look at you. School was same. I was different and a queer and some hate me. They attack me and one time with knife so i had knife for them. they never attack with knife again. lol

&amp;#x200B;

It never stoped. Mean words, spitting, pushing, dont look at you, men saying the horrible things from bar, throw bottles.  and same men touch you. i hated them all.

&amp;#x200B;

I do smoke drugs and alcohol i am mad at everything. i have friends who have same and near life as child and teenager. They parents fight and get anger. They are different like me some are gays also. My good friend she had leader of church who is her family do  worst things you can do to child. We all hate his town. what we want then to do scare me then and more now. why i am scared to talk to anyone. My friend had guns from her dad and we have small bombs soldier can do . This sound crazy and is. very very stupid. stupid teenagers i pray so much the worst did not happen.  I still pray thank God!

&amp;#x200B;

We hated them as much as they hate us. this do not solve problem anywhere it is stupid i know this now. I cry when i watch youtube of soldiers in Syria is horrible. To think I and friends be like dog Assad the worst. Nothing happend with friends but we did want to then a small time. Lot stupid talk stupid teenager and drugs. We stupid and see this and we put gun in box and take apart bomb no one can hurt we agree. Never hurt anyone ever. We know we are doing stupid thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 20's and i think this  i am bad person when i think about past. Good person do not think hurt people even if people hurt them. Anger all i was taught at home and in town and taught to fight for everything or people will fight you.  be strong person to fight everyone. My father tell me these things, be strong and how to fight with knife and gun as men will take everything if you do not learn this lessons. And same time i am weak to him. I care about him and he hurt me but to forgive is a virtue i guess. i try to live a virtue life but there is no God i think but good lesson.

&amp;#x200B;

I know these things I can not change. And now i am always mad. When i make mistake i yell at myself like he yell at me. You retard, bitch, cunt, whore and i do this most when i fail at art. Why? I love art so much.  I know I learn from farther and i want to stop. But it is so quick and i get madder and madder. The next thing i punch wall. I used to cut myself with knife and i stop for years and now i do this yelling. I do not want to cut myself anymore but i can not do this forever. The yelling the anger. I want it all to stop and so i can live. Like everyone else do. I know everyone not like me and I bad person.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw tumblr post from past and it say. ""it is like i am under water and so is everyone . I can not breath and they can. They act like normal and i am drowning""

&amp;#x200B;

When I was teenager at same time as horrible story I try to kill myself 2 time but i am scared of hell. Like the Italian poem i don't want to be tree forever being broken. God is clever with punish self killer with eternal life. this silly child thought and i do not want to die now. I want to live and that is problem anger stop me living.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is why i never have serious partner. I do not know how to have partner. And when i do who can love a bad person. a person who think this things. I would not love person who did plan to hurts others. I would not love myself. I would not talk to person like me. They dangerous person. They are like devil, yelling and being anger. i deserve this anger but i am tired. i want to live, how? 

&amp;#x200B;

I read redemption story but this story real life this person would go to jail. That is why I am scared. I never want to hurt anyone ever. Can you trust this person, i say no. Maybe it is best for everyone. I am afraid to talk. i never tell anyone but persons there at time. But one is doctor now. I am doing my best also. I do not know what do you guys think?

I manage to be patient with people I don't know because I can always give them the benefit of the doubt, but if someone I know as more than a passing acquaintance starts fucking with me in any way and they don't respond to requests to stop over time, then I get defensive which usually means angry for me (since that's what always worked to get people off my back in the past). And then I start having a short fuse with them for... the foreseeable future. I don't let go easily when people ignore me asking them to cut shit out that hurts me, I don't forget and I don't forgive; that's always protected me well. That also happens to keep the anger alive.

That finally added up in my marriage where in the end I was angry often, at the drop of a hat, and unfortunately felt justified for it: result, I was abusive and blamey more and more frequently (I'm getting help for this), on his side he was less and less caring about the effect of his actions most of the time, relationship deteriorated = divorce.

I realize maybe there could have been another path if I hadn't been so angry... maybe I would have seen ways to leave him sooner, at least. But the anger kept me feeling safe... so I didn't look as hard as I could have.

This kind of dependence on anger isn't sustainable... like, I need better reactions than anger to manage these situations but I have no clue which ones, or how to circumvent a really short reaction time where I get fired up in half a second or less.

The only thing I'm grateful for is that this doesn't happen often, but it's causing me real and massive problems in my life right now because it finally caught up to me. I don't want to end up blowing up a future relationship because of anger... my next relationships are going to be worth saving, if I can figure this out...

So how do I just learn to not go **boom** in a half-second? How do I catch myself?

I'm really not interested in post-explosion management or timeouts... that won't solve the issue for me, I react too fast and too furiously to catch myself even half the time. :/",1
"Long story short my child got lice and hand foot and mouth from an in home daycare provider. I called and left a voicemail that her services were no longer needed. She sends email stating that contractually (which I hadn't been aware of. I had never been informed) we needed to provide written notice and thus still owed her 2 weeks worth of pay. Sent her an email letting her know as cordially as possible that she was fired she doesn't get any further pay. 

&amp;#x200B;

My child now wants to go back to said provider since, ""she's no longer itchy"" She misses being there. Needless to say because of my actions she can't go back. How do I deal with the fallout from my anger here? I tried to contain it, but now I don't know if my actions were justified. Was I too angry? How do I know?",1
"Back in elementary and middle school, I had \*serious\* anger issues, so in 7th I left the physical school I was going to at the time and did online school until I started high school, and things were great after that! Sure I'd get frustrated occasionally, but for the most part I'd almost completely gotten over my anger issues. But now entering my senior year of high school, I've noticed that smaller things have been making me irritated and mad a lot more often, and my friends and peers have started to take notice too.

I was in a heated argument with a few friends today over a certain topic, and I was starting to get pretty pissed off, and one of my friends pointed out how pissed off I've been at everyone recently and only then did I notice it myself. I'm pretty sure this short fuse I'm now dealing with is coming from stress (mostly from starting my last year of high school and a lot of issues with the environment that have been going on recently.) and I just can't see the good in things anymore because of it, making this short temper of mine even worse. I'm really scared I'm going to lose my friends and my girl friend and I have no idea what to do about it. I've tried researching medicine that can help with this anger, but most of my searching has come up pretty bare bones. I have no idea what to do and it's making this stress even worse. Sorry for making this thread so long, but any and all advice is extremely appreciated, thank you. &lt;3",1

If someone doesnt reply to a direct question I've asked yet laughs at a stupid joke on a whatsapp group, my best friend fucked over my relationship and now we don't talk, fucking people are shit. I wish people were more direct, if you don't want to talk to me then fucking say, don't just ignore me. Someone in my work has been on the cards to be getting fired because no one likes her and hates working with her, its been decided in management that this is happening yet still she's still fucking there, and people are leaving because of it, i don't fucking understand fuck man i can't get this way again",1
" 

hello guys/girls ! im not a born english speaker. so my english will have grammatical mistakes. but i ll try to explain this in a good manner. Do note that this is 100% real and i just wanted to tell this ...

since i was little i was kinda antisocial and was afraid to go in to crowded places. and i have to tell you that i was shy too. my parents are just normal parents any one of you could have. although my dad was kinda strict when i do bad things(any dad is like this). but hes nice. its just he has a huge temper when i or anyone do anything wrong.(plz dont think my dad is abusing or anything. i love him so much.its just his temper is crazy). when i was in school i was kinda alone. i had friends and it was never hard nor easy to make friends. but i never did progressed with life like going to parties, study nights sort of things students do. and i liked to hurt little animals like kittens and chicks.(if i rememebr it right it was kinda an sudden impule a feeling i felt when i was a child :( but now i dont feel like this. i love animals and plants so much.i dont know what changed in me )things progressed and i stopped talking to people even best friends. its just i dont have anything to talk unless its a topic which i like. even with my family or my inner circle i always kept my silence until they speak about something. i wasn't that good with studies but i liked science and music(even now).i felt anger in these days but not in a huge rate like im feeling now.

i grew up and now im 23 years old. after school i enrolled to a university(currently in my last year) and now im doing an internship in software eng. i somehow managed to talk with people now. its good and it wasn't like before. but i always felt an emptiness in my heart and when im alone i think about stuff which i wasn't able to do and what is worse is i always thought about what i dont have. for an example im short af ! im male 5'2 and has 40kg weight. and i had this weight for over 5 years, i was slim always and never able to increase my height nor my weight or muscle mass. all of my friends are well developed they have nice body figures but i dont have. i was depressed over this and about the fact why im not like other people..from age 21 i noticed my anger isn't normal. its so impulsive that i even do things which i couldn't believe. when im angry i dont blame others or fighting with anyone. i just keep it to myself. and to release the temper i break stuff. but i stopped doing this because i have broken over 3 laptops,2 mobile phones etc because of my temper and i cant always afford new one. so instead i try to hurt myself when ever im angry. i had a BIGG ANGER OUTBURST last 2 week i almost bite off the flesh from my inner forearm. it was painful and i think the bite force did something to a vein inside my hand and from that day my hand is still feeling numb in a some area. when in a huge anger outbursts im having this impulse to drive a knife over me or do a very serious damage to myself. so i will just hit my head or hit a wall until its over. its just so destructive and im doubting i can live with anyone like this. im afraid i will hurt someone badly because of my anger. the reason for anger is anything. if i cant do anything i get mad and the worst part is, it progresses. if i fail at a game (i played league of legends and recently i quited.), my anger will burst out like a raging fire. some ares in my body hurt because i hit them with my fist. i always feel very gloomy and sad. when im not with anyone i think abut alot and get depressed.when that happens i smoke. will this get worst? am i having a mental illness ? i need to know what is wrong with me before going to a psychiatrist. i need your opinion plz.

PS : i smoke weed like everyday. not an alchol abuser. never did dangerous stuff like heroin or meth. But tried acid 3 times and all the 3 times i had good trips.",1
"It's very brutal, but it's true.

I live in residental block so at least twice a day my dog needs to bark like mad at the door.

It gives me a headache and drives me mad.

Every time this mongrel howls I want to beat him, even if I know that doesn't help, but I fell need to vent my rage on him.

I didn't hit him for now, but  everyday I feel like I'm closer to beating the shit out of it until it couldn't get up from floor.

If it would be possible I would take him to the shelter,but my mom is strongly connected with him, so I can't do anything about it.

I don't know what to do.  I don't want to talk about that with anyone from family. It's just too personal for me.",1
simply because of my anger it is impossible to share any negative feelings or actions in the relationship. refusal to listen until I stop getting angry but I don’t know how not to get angry but the issues keep building up and I feel like i’m gonna explode,1
"I'm 24M and I haven't always had anger issues, I have a social anxiety that makes me over think and over analyze things and people so I usually dont interact with others in public settings. As of lately I feel that I have been raging and lashing my anger out verbally on the ones I love  (my wife, daughter, sister and even some of my very close lifelong friends) I feel like a total asshat after my ""explosions"" the smallest things can set me off too such as my wife not answering the phone when I know shes on it, my friends when they make the simplest of mistakes, for example I'll lash out on my friend and just begin name calling and question their thinking/decision making skills, call them stupid, idiot, mental, or some other very hurtful things.. I feel like once I start to blow up there is NO going back and there is definitely no filter for what comes out of my mouth, some of the times its stuff I'd never even dare say, it's almost a uncontrollable reflex, I have to let it out or something but now I'm finding my friends and family becoming more distant with me.. what's wrong with me? Why am I so angry? Why cant I control my behaviors and actions? What can I do to control or minimize the rage I feel inside? 

Some background; I was taken away by CPS when I was 8 and was in and out of group homes until I was 11, got adopted by my brothers Dad and he was a alcoholic and slightly abusive, ran away from home and lived with a friend pretty much all of high school,   now I work full time with 1 kid and another on the way. I smoke to help relieve some of the anger issues I have and when I run out of smoke I get completely in a fit of rage over the smallest things , like losing in a online video game will set me off the walls, if I do smoke it only takes the edge away for a few hours then when I sober up I get ticked over the small things again. I need a permanent solution to my anger before I lose the ones I love.. 

Also I am not the best at writing and expressing my thoughts.",1
"I live with my wife,our son,her parents and her grandmother.
We pay 800 of rents for what's essentially a 1/1. Everyday that 800 seems to be going down the drain.
My wife has been fighting with her family for what feels like a daily basis now. Usually about the same thing. You see every after as my wife and I are exchanging work stores my mother in law comes to Interrupt with something sometimes news about our son(that I do not mind)other times random stuff or help with the same tech that she has been taught over and over again. IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE AN IPHONE STOP MAKING YOUR HUSBAND BUY THEM EVERY FUCKING TIME. Every morning the same scrambled egg breakfast,every afternoon the same beans with the occasional different protein,every Friday rice and beans only that.
Most days an argument between my wife and her mother either for the interruptions or for the fact that she moves our stuff",1
"I have been trying to work on my anger for.. well, a long time it seems like. I am almost 30 (cake day on Friday), have a baby on the way, and still have explosive episodes of ceaseless rage. This has been going on since I was about 7, and got hit in the head with a 2 liter bottle, I lashed out at my cousin with all the ""adult"" words I knew and started ripping up grass. My mom said it was quite the sight. I had anger management and spoke with a therapist for years, with only the minutiae of an idea of how to deal with myself. I've come quite a long way from ripping up grass; I don't really do any physical things to release my anger, I just stew. Deep and unending, until I fall asleep. It doesn't matter what it is, big or small, if it hits the anger tripwire, **I LOSE IT.** Completely and utterly. I don't even have many 'Big' things happen to me. Today is a great example. 


--The Blow Up--
I got screwed over at the DMV, for the third time, with my out-of-state transfer. My license expires on Friday, and I cannot make an appointment until Sept. 12th. So I essentially can't drive unless I want to be stressed out every time because my license is expired. I also have to take my passport to show I am over 18 for anywhere, since no one accepts an expired ID.

Well this event *Set.Me.Off.* I called my wife, belligerent, in a fit of rage. Obscenities reigned supreme within my limited vocabulary, often intertwined with spittle on my steering wheel. I left the DMV on the phone. For a good 5 minutes I screamed about the unfairness of it, the hatred I had for the man ""Jeff"", his laziness about not going the extra mile like his coworker beside him had done with the last customer, and bulahbulahbulah, all ending is a terrific bellow of **FUCK** at the top of my lungs, phone thrown into the other seat beforehand to save my wife's ears because in all the rage I thought of that.

The whole time my wife was on the phone (She had gone to the dmv and they screwed her over today also, but lo and behold she is cooler then Liquid NO^2) she kept saying little things to try and help, but they were lost. Finally, after the last scream, she said ""Wow."" and asked where I was, obviously wanting to end the conversation. 

--The Down--
I got home about 3 hours ago, I am still fuming with rage about the situation, but of course now I also feel like an asshole. I shouldn't have been screaming, it wasn't worth it. I can see that,  I saw it when my vision was tinted with rage; But I can't overcome it. I know that if anything were to happen today to get me going again, it would be 10x worse.

This is generally how my recursion takes place. I get pillar of salt mad, to which most of the time my wife bravely attempts to defuse me, then go into a 'hostile-pending' state. Finally ending with me apologizing for yelling about 2 hours before bed.

--The About--
About 4 years ago, when I met my wife, I had gone through a dramatic transformation. I had quit my stress-filled job, took my dog, and volunteered across the country for a year. I was homeless, had barely enough money to get food for myself (My dog always had food, because I love her more than me) and was happy. I ended my volunteer stint staying at a friends house, which turned into becoming a roommate, landing a job, and meeting my wife, all within a year. I was over the moon. 

Well the year passed, and I worked at this job, which slowly ruined my 'good buzz'. It ended up becoming extremely stressful, and (to this day) there was enmity in the office between employee and employers. Since it was a small company, they interacted a lot. I was one of the best managers there, with my friend, and we handled about 10 people, on top of various other things. I was essential, as the president put it. Then I got fired at 5am on a Wednesday, with no reasoning. They said, We want you gone, we will give you severance, but you need to leave (can explain if needed, but wasn't all my fault). While I wasn't ridiculous upset, I felt my heart drop out of the game. I was a shell for about 2 weeks, thinking I was inadequate, until I learned what happened. This, I think, was the beginning of the end for stress-less anger-less me.

I got a new job, working with AI, which really brightened my day when I got it. It's been 2 years now though, and they've added so much workload to the group of 4 that we are literally swimming. It's become stress filled again, and I can feel my grip slipping faster and faster.

--The TL;DR and End--
I just don't know how to control my cyclical action of becoming uncontrollably upset, 'stewing', then slowly rolling off the bed to the apology floor. I don't listen to reason, even from myself, and it makes me look stupid and feel noxious. Really just wanted to post this, ask for any advice or techniques. I need to fix this again, without going on a life-hiatus this time, and make it permanent. No one around me gets angry like I do, they barely get upset, passing things off easily, dealing with it like an.. adult. I don't want my Son to get dealt this card because he grew up with it like I did; I want him to see how happy I am, because I really am pretty happy with where I am. It just doesn't show because 3/4 the time I am foaming at the mouth because something small and simple happens. I've seen how green the grass is on the other side.. I really enjoyed myself back then. I want to get back to that side so I can play in the grass, instead of on the side where I ripped it all out.

Sorry for the wall.",1
"I have severe anger issues and impulse control issues and im about to start seeing a therapist and it scares the fucking shit out of me. Reason im posting is im wanting to know if anyone one else is in my boat amd instead if seeing a therapist just ""lets it out"" like has a place they go to too just fuck shit up and get out the aggression and anger and everything they are keeping inside. If so, what do you do? Does anyone know? Are you on pills or have you been committed for your issues or even diagnosed. I want to avoid a therapist and have an explosion place that when I lose it I dont continue to harm those near me in verbal ways or break shit and instead I can go to that place. Anyone?",1
"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm in my late 20s, I've been in a relationship for a few years now. We both came from really rough backgrounds and each have a lot of issues, which is great because normally we understand everything that's going on with each other. But my anger is ruining it and I honestly think she'll leave. 

I've spent Many years working on this stuff and I've come a long fucking way, but it's not good enough and feels like it'll never be good enough tbh. For context, I do have outbursts. I'll raise my voice and bitch about stuff. I'll toss my phone or controller onto the table, but I don't slam anything into walls. I don't break anything (I used to, many years before we were together). I don't punch anything. 

One really big thing I've never done is actually attack the person. When I'm pissed, it's always at some outside source or situation I'm in and I always make sure to say ""I'm not mad at you, it's not your fault, it's (whatever the situation is) and it's pissing me off but it's not you"". I've always had a lot of empathy - I've never laid my hands on another person, even as a kid I didn't get in scuffs at school. I never call someone names. I never threaten. I never belittle people in an argument - if there's a problem I'll address the problem at hand and that's it.

But it's not good enough. I still have outbursts playing video games or sometimes when little shit doesn't work right. And I raise my voice and bitch about it. I don't do it to intimidate people. I'm just bitching, I have to let it go or it feels like I'll explode. I mean, feel free to join in and bitch with me. To add, I can't give up gaming, it's all I got to get me through sometimes and it's not the main source of this.

My gf had bad partners in the past. They would yell at her and treat her like shit, generally abusive people. Me raising my voice is a big problem. I'm on meds for bipolar II (a condition she has as well, it's why we connected, and she's also on medication). I fell off my meds trying to work a normal job and live a normal life, it was too much. I'm trying to get back on them again but the side effects mean it takes time. 

In the meantime, idk what to do. Me raising my voice is like a trigger for her past. It makes me feel like a shitty human being, like I'm some kind of abusive asshole, but it's also frustrating because it means I have to find a way to never get angry at anything for, hopefully, the rest of our lives because I want to stay with this girl. Outside of this, everything is great. But she is VERY highly sensitive and I'm trying to deal with something I can't always control. It's stressful thinking I have to make sure I never go off my meds again (which means never going to work a normal job because that's how I got off them this time, I get paid disability for other things I'm trying to handle) and never get angry again at anything and I don't know how to handle it. 

I'm sorry for the novel. I don't really know what I'm asking for here to be honest. I just needed to talk. If I'm a piece of shit, let me know. If anything about how I'm feeling makes sense, let me know. I just need some insight on wtf to do. It's worth making this work, somehow.

Edit: Sorry for grammar mistakes.",1
"A bit of backstory: I've always had terrible issues with anger. At my first big job out of college I earned the ironic nickname ""Happy."" I've gotten into bar fights, have tumultuous relationships with loved ones, gotten into massive arguments with co-workers...generally had my life ruined because I shift between extreme anger and depression.

I've been to therapy (DBT) and I meditate but neither of those have taken the edge off.  (I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder).  I've read that there are no chemicals that can help with this.

But over the past 4 years things have gotten even worse. I can't hold a job. My depression became so severe I would lay in bed all day. Thank god I have a very supportive wife who has been there for me through all of this.

Over the past year though, and out of desperation, I've been researching and experimenting with supplements and nootropics. I ran across a book called [The Edge Effect: Achieve Total Health and Longevity](https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Effect-Longevity-Balanced-Advantage/dp/1402722478) and a test called the [https://www.bravermantest.com/](https://www.bravermantest.com/) and it's made huge difference in the way I understood the mind. (to be fair, the book is a bit corny and the author has been in a lot of legal trouble, but I was so desperate for help, I disregarded that and tried to see if his *idea* itself had any merit, and I'm really glad I did).

Every day I write down exactly the dosage of everything I take, how I feel, and what happened that day. I've gone 2 months now without any depression or anger. I cannot express how grateful I am to not feel irritable and edgy at everything and everyone, to not feel hopeless, resentful and just pissed off at the world. It feels like I've been released from prison. Not only that, but I've made a few tweaks that have helped my memory and motivation. I wanted to share it with you all in case you were interested in trying. Keep in mind, everyone's mixture of neurotransmitters is different so you will likely have to experiment with dosages as I have.

**for calmness/anxiety relief:**

Magnesium 800mg / day  - dosed at 200mg in the morning with coffee, otherwise I get too relaxed. (so far Ive tried magnesium oxide and citrate, with oxide being much stronger for me, but according to this article citrate is better than oxide: [http://www.immh.org/article-source/2016/11/17/magnesium-the-missing-link-in-mental-health](http://www.immh.org/article-source/2016/11/17/magnesium-the-missing-link-in-mental-health)). 2nd article is a study on the Mg effects on GABA receptors [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18799816](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18799816)

Ashwagandha KSM-66 600mg dosed when stress increases or someone has really pissed me off. Ashwagandha is also great for keeping me asleep. It lowers cortisol. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26068424](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26068424)

L-Theanine 200mg taken as needed. I like to take this when I have a lot of work to do and I need to focus but I don't want to feel too sleepy. works really well with coffee. I've taken up to 400mg with no negative side effects. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681988](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681988)

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16930802](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16930802)

**for happiness/lifting depression:**

St. Johns Wort 2800mg / day - 1400mg in the morning, 1400mg around 3pm; SJW is a reuptake inhibitor and works not only on serotonin but also GABA and dopamine. I think it is highly underrated and has a made a huge difference in the effectiveness of all the other substances.  [https://examine.com/supplements/hypericum-perforatum/#ref10](https://examine.com/supplements/hypericum-perforatum/#ref10)

5htp 100mg taken every other day.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9727088](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9727088)

You want to be careful with this stuff to not overdo it. It will work synergistically with the SJW. I cycle it with...

Inositol - 12g minimum and up to 20g per day. This stuff has some gastrointestinal side effects so you have to build up a tolerance to it. start off with 2g in your morning coffee (I buy the powder and the taste is mildly sweet) and increase the dosage.) Also works on allowing you to ""let go"" of fights or arguments. [https://examine.com/supplements/inositol/](https://examine.com/supplements/inositol/)

The magic for me was making sure I was getting enough GABA and serotonin. If I had enough serotonin but not enough GABA, I would be happy but still be easy to fight. With just GABA, I would be calm and could avoid fights but the depression would still be there. It's a weird combo.

**for motivation**

the thing to be careful with here is that dopamine increases drive/motivation/focus, but it also increases nor-adrenaline and nor-epinephrine. add these on last, when you're feeling really relaxed lol and actually need to work. Some of you will just need some coffee. just be mindful that if you start feeling irritable again and take some Ltheanine, Mg, or Ashwagandha to bring you back down.

uridine monophosphate -  25mg - 75mg sublingual - depends on how relaxed I'm feeling and how much work I need to get done. no need to take everyday unless motivation is a real problem. works really well with fish oil. make sure you get one where the DHA is over 400mg and EPA over 500mg. It's a good idea to take fish oil everyday.

N-Acetyl-Tyrosine (NALT) - 300mg as needed. It's a precursor to dopamine, nor-adrenaline and nor-epinephrine. If you're feeling edgy, decrease the dose and take some L-Theanine.

**for concentration/general improved brain functioning**

100mg - 400mg / day Alpha GPC (Also a great pre-workout). Some people get headaches with this stuff so if you do, you likely are getting enough from your diet and probably have a great memory, lucky you.

2g Fish Oil / day

B Vitamin

Paleo diet - meats, vegetables, fruits. Over time, you want to get the majority of the precursors from your neurotransmitters from your diet. I've noticed that if I eat protein late in the evening, I have trouble sleeping, I think due to an increase in tyrosine. So now I eat carbs at night for serotonin &amp; melatonin, and protein/veggie heavy breakfast/lunch. Also helps to eliminate afternoon crashes. I've experimented with a lot of diets and this is what works for me.",1
"I can be the sweetest person but also the worst person. Today I was so upset, that I hurt four people who are really close to me.

I found out it was her because the school said the exact amount of alcohol I had in the fridge, something she only would know. She also went through my medication and told everyone about my private mental health issue. To this day I’m waiting for my number to change since she has it so I can sign her up for websites that spam numbers until it’s made virtually unusable.

Gotta go back tomorrow hopefully  i can move past it and hopefully they do to

I gotta get my shit in check",1
"Currently considering starting anger management classes, but I feel hopeless. 

I am going to try no matter what, but I feel like my anger is just uncontrollable. I'll go a month being fine and then all of a sudden I'll have an episode where I let it get the best of me. I feel like I flip out and destroy shit before my brain can even process what's happening. 

Is this normal for people with anger issues? I know it's a constant, lifelong struggle, but who has a success story stopping this behavior?",1
"I am 33 Male and I am unmarried . I dont have a stable job . I have no friends . I have no Siblings . I live with my dad .

I have always been a Ahole because of my mouth . I have ruined relationships because of my anger issues . I try to control it but sometimes I just go off even because of smallest of things .

I dont know why but I get angry at my dad a lot . He has given up everything for me and he has dealt with my anger issues as patiently as he could . But I dont know how to control my anger . I burst at unexpected times .

Today, my dad kept 2 water bottles for me in the fridge which already had three inside . It was looking messy to me so I burst out and took the ones he put inside and poured it in the sink . Thinking about it at night , I know I couldve handled it better but at the time it is happening I cannot stop myself .

I want my life to end because I am pushing everyone away because of my Anger .",1
"I have had anger management and anxiety problems for a long long time... I've noticed, now that I have trained myself to notice, that I do not have the normal physiological... Side effects I guess is the proper verbiage... That go hand in hand with it... Sweating, increased heart rate, adrenaline rush, etc... My body doesn't respond that way... I know I'm angry. I feel the emotion. Mentally I slip into it like a well fitted suit. But I don't have the 'normal' physiological things...  I was wondering if anyone else has this issue and what it means...",1
"This sounds weird and awful to me to even say but realizing a lot of my anger this year is related to medical staff saying what sounds like slick rude shit when I'm already sick and vulnerable. I didn't have health insurance for a few years so maybe I got out of practice or I'm just being spoiled but I feel like a lot of medical offices and sometimes even doctors themselves are just wild rude with no provocation and don't care bc you need their service so you have to eat it. I always feel like I should be grateful for medical help so I'm kind of over the top fake nice since my normal personality sometimes reads as ""cold"" and my mom always told me to smile and just eat whatever shit the doctor gives me because they're the expert and you need to make them sympathize with you but I feel like I'm being cartoon nice just to be shot down or outright laughed at for whatever I say trying to be friendlier than normal. having one good doctor who treats me kindly just spoiled me so I leave rude doctors furious that they kicked me when I was down and I'm paying them to help. I need to get it under control bc it's obv not helping my outcomes to be mad after I leave but I feel like it's this constant stream of unpredictable judgement about things that aren't even medical in nature or anyone's business. I had an eye doctor tell me in the dead of winter that I was ""dusty looking and you must never drink water because your whole face looks thirsty"" which was just super extra and had nothing to do with my eyes and was kind of ridiculous to say on a below-freezing day when all her patients looked kind of wind-burned. A billing agent at my primary doctor's office told me my insurance wasn't accepted and ""it would be different if you were working but we don't accept unemployed."" I self insure but own a legitimate company and my insurance is valid, just not accepted there but she acted like I demanded free care or threw a fit that I'd have to self pay, which I did cheerfully without argument. The worst was an emergency dentist I went to when I chipped a tooth on hard food, who straight told me I'm disgusting bc she knows I don't floss and when I said I absolutely do, sometimes 2-3x a day and have a really extensive oral hygiene routine she says ""No honey, healthy gums don't look like that and I can tell when patients are lying to cover for laziness."" A week later my regular dentist confirmed I had been flossing correctly and I just had hereditary problems with my teeth that had nothing to do with me being disgusting or a liar. More recently the same office keeps trying to refer to my work travel as ""vacation"" and tell me I'm not allowed to fly again until next year after a procedure that should only ground me for a week bc I've ""traveled more than enough this year"" like it was just for fun and not how I afford their services. It's gotten better as my health improves so I'm sure I'm responsible for taking shit too hard when I'm hurting and I'm sure I was stressing some Drs out bc I was in so much pain earlier but I thought Hippocratic oath extended to just basic courtesy or bedside manner in situations that aren't an emergency and the patient is def not belligerant. One doctor was so harsh with me I cried in the car after the appointment like a crazy person then called back to apologize to the staff, who were actually very nice that time and said there was no need to apologize and they were sorry I had left an appointnent feeling guilty and would move me to another doctor. Is this my temper causing problems, does everybody get roasted by their doctor and I'm just expecting too much, am I trying too hard to hold down my normal temper and getting sonned because they perceive me as weak or not mature? I'm about to have surgery next week and need pointers on how to handle this without making myself pissed or having to smile thru rude comments when it's not necessary or at least present myself as someone worth speaking to like an adult bc I'm too old to be getting laughed at by people I'm making an adult transaction of thousands of dollars with. I hope I've never actually been rude back bc they're still in charge of my care but I feel myself slipping into having an equally slick mouth when someone just laughs in my face or I hear an assistant talking shit/laughing about my accent or face or whatever in another room like I'm hard of hearing. I spend so much of my income on medical care that I can no longer afford mental health care for my anger issues but feel like I deserve at least the same respect I would get if I were a customer paying that much for any other service. Not that the customer is always right or I want special treatment- but I already struggle with mental health so can they at least go to a room far enough out of earshot I can't hear you making fun of me for the face I make in pain bc I just leave the Dr feeling bullied when I wouldn't let anyone who didn't go to medical school straight call me disgusting and smile thru it",1
Can anyone make sense of this? I'm worried I might do something I'll regret the rest of my life.,1
"and their insinuations piss me off or not even compliments - them simply drawing up the wrong conclusion about my character and when I correct them of my intention and meaning they ignore/drown me out and it pisses me off, pisses me off until I'm so twitchy I want to squeeze the life out of them I'm so irrationally angry and restless right now god bloody hell I need to meditate for real I think I have such a bloody temper and easily bruised ego - god I should  shrug them off but I'm so bloody annoyed/irritated gah

how do you guys deal in the moment? or can't physically move away (stuck in the same room because class)? I get so twitchy my hands just end up abusing my pen and I make it do acrobatics and my face is all damn tight and strained fuck fuck fuck",1
"I have a mixy new coworker who's always demanding I suck his dick, telling me I'm the only girl so I have to cook and clean then causing mess on purpose and blaming me, accusing me of being a prostitute, telling me I'm a joke and I lied about my whole career then playing victim when I tell him Ive had a valid career and reminding him he used to hang out at the business I managed playing Xbox and eating comp food but he just swears ""you were just an intern there to serve me so do what you're told"" then starts trolling for sympathy that ""see how she puts me down?! She's abusive and toxic"" even tho he was threatning to stick my toothbrush up his ass and jerk off on my towel a second earlier when no one was in the room. He threatens to snitch on me then tells everyone I'm a snitch for what he snitched about and just says so many disrespectful sexually harassing demeaning unnecessary things I lost my shit and yelled at him constantly bc I'm not just sitting there quietly with my hands folded being told this shit in front of people who might believe him and jump on board when he says I love gangbangs. Even when I tried to remove myself chill in my room he pounds on my door and tries to pick the lock yelling and same shit if I use the bathroom, knocks and screams the whole time i'm a selfish bitch when there's other empty bathrooms. I'm allowed to drive a company car so if I leave he blows me up with errands then calls the boss saying I bailed. I used to have a terrible temper with no conscious control but have made a lot of progress this year and gone since last Halloween til now without any blowups. I thought removing myself from last job was the answer bc I had a subordinate who just refused to work then would try to strangle me if I told him to get off his ass. So technically this is better bc no assault but is getting so fucking old and I'm having so many health problems and dealing with the death of so many people in my life I can't deal with this shit broke but also hard to keep a cool head and a smile when I'm already upset and smiling thru the pain then suddenly got a shadow talking shit constantly and putting me down then playing victim when anybody around bc I'm so ""abusive and evil"". I won't snitch but asked my boss open ended if I have to put up with bullshit to keep working bc dude obv thinks he's just gonna push me into being a easy victim to dump on which isn't fucking happening because I'm grown but even then he runs tells other people I was ""crying and playing victim bc she's a messy ass female who's tryna turn us men against each other"" and that was the best I kept my temper bc I just repeated we all know that aint happen so next he started going in about my family don't love me and I need to be in a mental hospital and I piss everyone off and he shouldn't have to put up with ""my"" bullying bc it lowers his self esteem and he has kids and a family who actually loves him so he doesn't deserve to have me take it out on him how pathetic and terrible I am. then laughed hysterically when other people told him that was over the line and just shut the fuck up for ten minutes but it set me off again bc unfortunately parts of that are true but he doesn't know and has no right to say my fam don't love me even tho they don't and used to bully me as a kid so that's why I even pay this little asshole any mind. He also heard me on the phone with my Dr and made jokes about I'm secretly getting my bad boob job and ass lift fixed so he'll think I'm pretty and it's not fucking funny because I have no cosmetic surgery, my natural body is fine, he's a dick for eavesdropping, and spreading rumors I'm getting plastic surgery bc I'm a whore when I'm scared af to have necessary surgery and afraid I might not make it thru, is genuinely fucked up bordering on cruel. I hear how his girlfriend talks to him on the phone and other employees roasting him for being a fat young kid so he's just looking for someone weak to unload it on and I understand the psycholoy of manipulation but I refuse to be the garbage can just to feel sorry for his ass when he lit me up the minute he walked in the door bc ""you're dressed like a whore with your rack and ass out"" on a 118 degree day. Just afraid I'll give myself a heart attack in anger if I passively let him rip me apart and taint a 20 year business reputation with ugly ass rumors and I'm the only woman so he knows people might eat it up and join him. men excuse rape by saying ""she didn't resist"" so while some people are telling me to just ""be the bigger person and ignore him"" I donno if he'd take it as an invitation and actually try me then say I wanted it in which case I feel justified being angry and matching his bullshit just to show him I'm not a target. There is no HR situation bc if I snitched I'd disappoint myself and my integrity and it'd help nothing but this is foolish to keep blaming myself that I deserve it or welcomed it bc I tried to nip it in the bud standing up for myself and he found it cute and funny. No one ever treated me with this much desrespect at any job except maybe the strangler, even dude I worked with that literally smoked crack and snorted powder at the office. He kept complaining ""everybody says you're cool and solid but I think you're a mean bitch and I'm gonna expose how fake and evil you are"" like I aint known the same people 15 years who all spoke well of me and just never been verbally abused like this on the job but to him that's ""fake."" Please share whatever help you can bc I been home a week making myself sick that I'm weak and deserve this shit just like when my relatives bullied me and I'm sure he's laughed it off, forgot, and gone back to his loving family so I'm only hurting myself and making him right that I'm unlovable and sour so I deserve to be treated like shit. I have a real anger problem myslf but I never been a bully or tried to push people over the edge, I just get furious when people assume I'm sweet and here I am again

Edit: I appreciate comments that this is valid abuse and tell HR but I know that already and there's no type of HR department or recourse- I handle it myself or not at all. This is a section of the entertainment industry that MeToo can't touch but it floors me I was treated with a lot more respect as an exotic dancer in the adult industry years and years ago when I was young. But that's why he justifies it's my fault and I'm the toxic abusive one, he perceives I used to be a whore even tho it was a ""clean"" club and I have trouble getting any job with a background check/HR dept bc stripping license shows up so I'm supposedly stuck and have to eat it. i have honestly resorted to violence w previous coworkers but they were all reasonable fights with medium sized men who respected they went too far and backed off, where as this dude might take me out with no effort just on size and no one around me should be expected to defend me or anything. The reason I posted this in /anger instead of making it a sexual harassment thing is bc my reaction just feeds him and it's fucking frightening to have no control over this except lose my job and therefore punish myself.

2nd edit: I understand normal channel is HR or speak to union local but I don't have either available so I'm just here asking for damage control advice holding down my own temper until I can find a reasonable solutio, just to stop encouraging him with the bullshit since my anger is so funny and validating to him. Also I realize this sounds like I'm a Real World cast member but just technical crew

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Somebody else vouched I wasn't starting shit and I got so mad I almost threw hot greae but waljed away so even more, I need advice how to better use my temper to shoot down disrespectful shit without acting like a clown myself, not legal etc. There is really no legal channel for this anymore given people are aware and little chance of grtting fired now but it shows me I have a long way to go being effective with my own temper

Last update: Probably focusing on professional gambling now bc you can always call floor on wild inappropriate men but other patrons usually do it first. This sounds absurd but at least no union rules lol. Thanks to everybody for offering support",1
"I will give a couple of examples.

I haven't seen my therapist since April. She went away due to ""unforseen circumstances"". I got a letter last month saying she was back and I have phoned the reception countless times to make an appointment. I'm suppost to be getting an appointment letter since last week but I'm still waiting. Again. How is it acceptable for someone with mental health issues to go 3 months without support?

My masters supervisor did not give me any help on my dissertation. He admitted that he didn't know how to use the software. Now it is finished I needed a letter of recommendation off him but he has not replied. He doesn't do anything to help me.

I was buying some running shoes online and paid for premium delivery as it was coming from Belgium. The stuff hasn't even been shipped yet and it is likely I will have to wait a week (it was suppost to take 2 days).

There's more but this is the stuff off the top of my head.",1
"I’m always angry I don’t know why even the slightest thing from just thinking or even moving makes me want to yell and be destructive, like throwing a tantrum. I don’t know what it is but I’m only calm when I’m in the rain or watching it. I love “bad” weather, like lightning, and rain. Anyone else almost always angry?",1
"Company cancels an interview with me during the interview, I know someone interested in making prank calls.Recruiter cancels interviews on me multiple times and won't connect with me on Linkedin - I know someone interested in using a private internet program to send ASCII dongs.

I'm angry at my life situation. I'm angry at the F'd up stuff my family does to me. When I turned 23 my grandmother had promised me a car for 3 years of college so I didn't pick up a second job. I got written up for having a lit candle in my room my junior year. She assumed it was for weed (to be fair, it was) and decided to keep the promise but cut me out at the last minute after my dad decided to tell her this right as I graduated. I do semi-illegal things by using points of contact that are hidden to lash back at bussiness owners/people in the job market that screw me over when I'm looking for a job and the interviewers cancel on me multiple times,don't show up, or tell me that I ""wouldn't be able to afford an hour long commute"" and stop responding to me even after I send them a money calculator showing them how I'd organize my funds. I've prank called, I've sent ASCII dongs, etc. My dad had me watch our pets the other weekend and put all security cameras on constantly in our house and put a new hidden one in in the driveway to spy on me in between me coming home from work at night. So I put a piece of tape over the one in the driveway and he texted me when I got home after watching the footage saying if I touch the cameras again they'd kick me out. I tried to buy parents an Atari retro console for Xmas and they gave it back to me and told me they didn't care about it. They forced clothing upon me I told them I didn't want in advance and said I was kicked out if I didn't take it, when I told them I didn't need anything from them and I'd rather see them put the money away towards my siblings college education, have $50 in cash to pay my rent. They forced me to lie to get into a psych ward for 9 days or I was going to be kicked out, made me lie about trying to hurt myself as punishment for calling CPS on them. My dad has been mostly ignorant in being involved in my life and my mom makes up stories when my dad isn't  home and tries to sabotage my life. I fucking hate them both. I hope they both die in a car accident. But I'm trapped here working a low wage job trying to find a fulltime job and earning my license.

In the mean time, a supervisor at my job threw away my personal possessions one day, and other days power trip and tell me I did things differently than how they told me to, which I have extremely good hearing and can hear someone whispering across the room, and know for a fact they told me one thing then didn't expect the result so asked me to change things by telling me I did it wrong. I went home sick one night throwing up and they called me the next morning asking me why I wasn't at work, knowing full well I wasn't allowed to return to work by company policy. As I arrived to work I heard 4 other people called out of work. And they threatened to write me up for ""being sick without calling to remind them I'm sick"", which is retarded in and of itself and I was never aware of that policy because no-one has ever told me.",1
There have been a lot of times in the past where people either purposefully didn't include me or bullied/harassed me in some sort of way. This has led for me to hold in a lot of anger related to these incidents. No one except one person has been a decent enough person to apologize for the pain and suffering that they caused which is a little frusterating. How do I let go of this. I feel like it has been derailing my life for the last two days. Yesterday o was angry about the way others have treated me for probably at least 3ish hours. :/,1
"So needless to say, I have ALWAYS had a problem with my mouth. Back-talked a lot as a child. Had a lot of soap in my mouth too but that clearly never made the problem go away. I sometimes get upset at work and say something stupid and get myself into trouble. Basically I was pulled into the office yesterday and was told if I had an attitude again I was going to be fired. 

So my question is, what the hell do I do about my mouth? It happens so fast, it's like my brain doesn't have a chance to even comprehend what is going on. My mouth just spurts out some stupid crap and then my brain kicks in and is like, ooo shouldn't have said that dude. 

What do I do?! I don't want to loose my job! I have learned to walk away when I start to feel irritable.. but then there are situations where there is no irritability... someone says something or does something to anger me and then word vomit. Ugh....",1
"Hey guys, I am having problems with dealing with anger. 7 years ago, I was bullied for 2 years in school while I was 13-14 years old. My parents split up, when I was 7 months old and my stepfather adopted me, when I was 5 years old. I don't have problems with anger most of the time but when my members of my family turn against me in an argument and are ignorant and toxic towards me, there is nothing I would rather do than just punch them in the face. Sadly my family can be pretty ignorant and toxic while argueing and it hurts me everytime when I'm trying to reason with them. Just yet I had an argument with my stepfather and he punched me in the stomach after I pulled him towards me to reason with him because he would ignore me and after that punch I would have loved to punch him back but my mother split us up. Also my stepsister came along in that moment and just joined his side just because... I would like to stay cool in these situations. Thanks in advance.",1
"I have known I have some anger issues throughout my entire life. Both my parents had different forms of anger issues that have both manifested it’s way into becoming the way I cope which is terrible but I’m aware of it but so hard to control in the moment. 

I somewhat always try to self victimize, get control issues with people close to me, and let minimal emotions that don’t need to become a problem become a problem somehow.

I’m really bad at explaining how this is but I’m very insecure about everything. Trust issues and think everyone is out to get me or dislikes me. I feel as if I need to be in constant contact with someone 24/7 and if they don’t answer I get slightly upset but keep it internal but it’s fine if I do the same. This is toxic for myself and others around me. This is mainly with people close to me like extremely close. This only happens with bestfriends and my parents. My mom left me for drugs when 7 years ago but was addicted since I was 3. Dad kicked me out for 2.5 years but it’s better but I obviously have some abandonment issues that turn into control issues that turn into a rage whenever something does not go my way. These emotions of anxiety, feelings of potential abandonment which is never abandonment but I think my actions of rage push people away, and my sadness and self insecurity I can recognize but I don’t understand how to control it in the moment.

Whenever people make little comments or don’t react to me in the way I expect them to in general life it really gets to me and I don’t know why and how to control it in the moment because I obviously don’t need to pick a fight about every single thing that annoys me and I don’t need to be annoyed most of the time anyway",1
I am absolutely furious. No words exist that can convey how insanely angry I am at this very moment. I want answers to this question. How the fuck do I cope with this?,1
"I still feel very raw and hurt by the people at my last job. It's been half-a-year now, and when I think about them I get a fiery feeling in my chest. It's like a poison.

I'm trying to move on, I'm back in school, and my new career is going to pay 2-3x as much. And it won't involve toilets, which is a plus. But I'm still upset with my boss, all my bosses, for being such phonies. I still have bad dreams about that place. Sometimes I daydream of going back to visit and telling them off.

Yesterday I was driving home &amp; I saw the woman ; one of the women; who really set me off. I parked, and on one hand I wanted her to talk to me so I could yell at her, and on the other hand I didn't know if I could control myself. So I went in a building and waited for 10 minutes &amp; when I came out she was gone.

... Shouldn't the depression medication be suppressing my crazy side, not enhancing it? How can I forgive people if I can't move past the hurt?",1
"I ran to Kroger to get things to make dinner. I was on my bike. On my way into the driveway I hit the curb too hard and dropped and shattered the hot sauce. I was so fucking mad at myself. I know it's just a 10min trip down to the corner store and a couple bucks. If it would have been my friend or my girlfriend I would have laughed it off. But I cant stop thinking about it. All the ways I let it or caused it to happen.

I know the standard response is ""dont be so hard on yourself"" or ""dont sweat the small stuff."" I just can't understand why I get so angry at myself when I wouldnt get this upset at anyone else.",1
"Hey guys, throw away since my friends and family know my main account. I'm not quite ready to drop this on them quite yet. Essentially, my anger outbursts have started to effect my personal and professional life. For a long time, I just let my emotions fly and tapped into whatever I was feeling. Angry, happy, sad, etc, etc. I just acted however and whenever. These were of course my teenage and young adult years. As I got older, I realized I needed to hold them in check and monitor myself. My outbursts are down to -nearly- never. But...not never. 

Last year, same month, actually. I had a really bad episode where I just ""lost control"" and mouthed off to someone who was breaking up with me. I said a lot of mean nasty things that WHILE I WAS SAYING IT I was hating myself and regretting it. But the moment I realized I was too heated, she said something or even just her facial expression pissed me off and I went back to my tirade. My outbursts have -never- been violent and has never been shouting or anything, just obvious anger and saying things I don't really mean. 

Well. Today it happened again. I got a VERY minor warning at work and instead of just saying hey sorry wont happen again. I got SO upset and it ended with me and my boss arguing momentarily before he told me to go home for the day and cool off. I was SO disrespectful and SO rude and out of line. I am embarrassed and ashamed of myself. If I were him, I would fire me.

The best way I can describe it is ME standing NEXT to myself watching someone else control my words and body language. It's not me but yet here I am popping off and showing a side of me that I loathe. I'm not sure what the next step is. Should I be looking into therapy or medication? I've been working on my ""anger"" for well over 3 years now and while I've made progress from ""if angry be angry"" to ""if angry breath and cool off"" but unfortunately two moments in the past two years have been BIG blow ups. 

As an adult, I feel like 2 blow ups nearly 360-ish days apart is still unacceptable. At least on the level they're at. I cool off super quick, but the second they speak or defend themselves I get mad again. Both times I was 100% in the wrong for my actions and how I reacted.",1
"I'm just under 5 ft tall and her boyfriend is somewhere around 6 ft. I was sitting on the edge of their bed in their studio apartment after we returned from a night of drinking. We were toasty but not sloppy. He started off by saying really mean, degrading things to her. We called him out on it but he would laugh it off and dismiss us. You could tell she was getting uncomfortable and she went to walk towards the door and he put his arm across her chest and then grabbed her arm and pulled her back which made me very uncomfortable. I was there with a date of mine who was disappointingly just watching this all unfold. I didn't know what to do to help and my blood pressure and temperature started rising. i could absolutely feel the rage coming on. He said another nasty thing to her while having his hand on the small of her back and she aggressively pushed his hand away and that was followed by him shoving her. At this point i just kind of lost it. I looked at my date and said you need to have my back. I stood up and literally went flying at him like some kind of tree monkey and pushed him up against the wall. He was taken aback and tried to push me off of him so i put my hand on his forehead and pushed it up against the wall while keeping my arm against his chest. I must have had 9 kinds of crazy in my eyes because once i said ""here's what's going to happen, you are leaving for the rest of the night and don't you dare come back"" he looked around the room and sauntered out. His girlfriend broke down when he left and said this had apparently been going on for awhile. She broke up with him the next day. I've been working on controlling my anger for years but I think this is the one time where it actually helped a situation. Even still, i'm sure there was a better way to handle it. Having the rage is hard",1
"I have anger issues. Since I was a kid my family had said that I had a short temper. One time I got so drunk and angry at my brother, that I broke a glass on my hand by smashing it on the table. I been with my girlfriend for 6 years. In those six years my anger has gotten out of control five times with her. I know it might not seem like much, but I don’t remember them. I would get angry, I would be verbally abusive and make her cry. I rarely get angry at her she could be screaming at me and I can control myself. But if I had more than two beers or I had enough my anger skyrockets and I black out. Now she is afraid of me and she is tired of giving me chance. This weekend was the last straw. We were drinking at a party and I asked her to come downstairs because her and her friend were upstairs, she basically said in a little. And I got upset because I didn’t want to be by myself. I got upset and the same thing that always happens. I get angry and I start to be emotionally abusive. But I don’t understand. I don’t have patience with anyone else. You do something bad to me and I’ll make sure you regret it. But with her is different. Is at parties, is when we are having fun, and suddenly I ruin the entire evening because I didn’t get it my way. I don’t want to lose her but I feel like it’s too late. She told me she doesn’t trust me, and she is scared of me. What can I do? I have set up a meeting with a psychiatrist for anger management, but I don’t think that would be enough.",1
When you lose your temper over something and someone comes back in a couple minutes and asks if I’ve “CalMed DowN yeT” IT MAKES ME SO FREAKING PISSED. Like fuck no and you’re only making me more fucking mad.,1
"I was hit alot by my older brother when I was little which led me to develop serious anger problems as an adult ... I sometimes get these snaps where I lose my temper and start punching the wall, bed, anything in the proximity ... Don't drink alcohol to not make it worse... but when I enter this state I'm agitated to the point I lose all control and can't maintain any sense of rationality... It happened to me today because the cell service company ripped me off and I hurt myself hitting things and feel like shit for losing it ... I just want some way I can think straight when anger takes over",1
"I'm new to this sub, and I think that it's past the point of overwhelming feeling. Baby's cry and scream for no reason and it angers me. I don't get why they do, why cry if you have no reason to cry? If I give you food why would you scrunch it up or throw it all on the floor!? Why are you rolling around in the dirty floor? I get so angry and I'll be honest I've hurt a couple kids accidentally trying to stop them from doing things, I just can't be gentle I don't know how. (Well when I'm angry other than that im perfectly fine around them) i don't know what to do anymore or how to relax, all these why questions are just so frustrating. Suggestions?

"I can't stand my brother, he used to be a nice little brother now he's a little asshole in the house. All I want to do is punching him straight on face to death, but I can't kill my own family so I punch a light switch with my bare hand and it shattered into pieces, leaving a bruises and scratches on my knuckle.

I'm glad my anger doesn't end up so badly into hurting others...",1
"So basically I'm afraid to be anger. I start to cry and shift from the feeling of anger that is building up in me, to feeling sad and desperate. 

Some background.. my father was an explosive person when it came to anger (he never took a hand on us, but he liked to throw things, scream, curse and walk away). As a teenager I was really angry all the time, probably because I was not able to resolve the issues with my parents, so I took the possibility of being angry on other people. Ofc I was explosive as well, and made big dramas, walked away etc. (all the bullshit my father did).

Two years ago I started going to therapy. Realised I had a ton of anger unresolved in me. Besides I wanted to become a better person, I felt bad (and still do) about all the hurtful things I've said to people, how I just cut them off etc. This has led me to the point that I am afraid of being angry. As my therapist has said, I am afraid of confronting my anger, I get scarred as soon as it arises. 

So it's like this. Something happens, I get anxious (that's my default mode every time something is not right - and anxiety was the reason I started going to therapy), I realise ''ok something is not right, let's give me space'', I image the safe space I deserve to open up and feel my emotions, I start to cry, and I cry, and I let it out, and then I realise how disappointed and angry I am about 'X'.  And the rage is building up and I'm just stuck there, like what to do!?!?. Yesterday I screamed in my pillow and smashed it in the wall, to the point I cannot really move my neck today haha. Other times I go for a run or smth.  Yoga and meditation for now are ok for anxiety and fear but not anger. 

Ok so the point of this thread is... What is the right approach to anger? I believe this is just one of the emotions and if I just shut it away, it won't do any good. But I don't feel comfortable expressing it, probably because I'm afraid I'll become my father.

And don't get me wrong, I don't expect solutions for my therapy, I will work on that as well, but now she is on a leave she takes one a year for a longer period, so I need some advice or maybe some information from somebody with a similar problem. 

TL;DR: I don't know how to express anger because I am scarred I will go nuts and will be angry forever and I'll lose my calmness I tried to build the past years.",1
"I've been having extremely violent thoughts that are centered around harming myself and others. I wouldn't act on them but I know that they're unhealthy. Its so overwhelming, when they start I can't focus on anything else. I don't like thinking this way. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions for managing violent thoughts?",1
"I'm 13 and my anger issues are becoming a serious issue to the point where I become immensely angry roughly one to two times a day. It can be over the smallest things, but I always end up screaming at the top of my lungs, scaring my pets, and crying afterwards out of anger. It's a cycle. My parents express no empathy towards me and, instead of helping me or leaving me alone, they scream at me and act like I'm choosing to act like this, like it's my fault. I think it's important to note that I was out of school for anxiety and depression at one point, but my anger wasnt our main focus. I've experimented with meditation, breathing exercises, and mindfulness. Nothing is working. Please give tips",1

"Hi. Just to give a quick tldr of my anger problem; I've been pretty much aggressive and prone to anger since I was young. Got into a lot of fights along the years and stuff.

In the past 2 years I've experienced anger tantrums, because of problems. It doesn't happen to get a tantrum that often, it is something extremely rarely actually, but when it happens I start punching the walls inside my house until I manage to calm down (never done it in public, I am just controlling myself and blow all the steam off when I get home).

I got to a point in which I get angry when people shout at me or even make any kind of mean remarks, and that anger often leads me to being aggressive (again I control myself in public, only time I cannot hold it together is when somebody actually hits/ punches me, from that moment, I stop being rational and give in to anger).

I am not sure how to get away from this toxic behavior and I am afraid it might affect me in the long run. I don't like sharing what I feel with other people, usually keeping things inside, that's why I came on reddit with a ""fake"" account.

What can I do to ""fix"" this issue of mine? Talking to people about it might not actually be that easy.",1
So there was a kid at my school who was a year younger he tripped me (I’m weaker then a normal guy) one day he broke the camels back I just snapped at him almost killed him (he was in the fourth grade and I was in the fifth grade) help me stop snapping at people,1
I just don’t know what to do at this point.,1
"I have a problem. I am really mean to my girlfriend. Anytime something doesn’t go my way or I feel threatened in any way I’ll have flashes of impulsive aggression where no matter what I am doing or who I am talking to I will become really aggressive. I have nothing but love for her but I know I am hurting her. I have been verbally abusive and my actions are not healthy for either of us. My actions have caused her to feel very low as well. I don’t know what is wrong with me. I crossed the line and I think I lost her for good. I feel like two different people and am worried my actions will now have lasting affects on our relationship. I am constantly battling to do the right thing in my head. I have voices that speak to me in my head telling me what to do and not to do and it’s overwhelming at times. She says that if I  really loved her I wouldn’t treat her this way and it makes sense but in this case it’s just not true. I have nothing but love for her, I care for her and I want the absolute best for her. She’s everything to me and I don’t want to lose her. 

How do I control myself? Is this something I can work on or do I need medical help? 
How do I convince her that I love her and what I say out of anger is not really me? 
How can I better myself for the both of us so that we may have a chance of having a long, strong relationship? 


This has really gotten me fucked up lately. I can’t lose the best thing that has happened to me. She deserves the best and I need to make myself better for myself and for her. 

Any advice?",1
I usually do not become upset but when I do it is difficult to reason with me. I have been told once you get angry you lose the argument and whoever cares less wins. I do not want to be an overly sensitive triggered millennial. I generally avoid conflict or uncomfortable situations but that is the most rational way to live honestly. It looks weak and cowardly to become upset but I do.,1
"When I'm mad, it feels like I have something backing me up, I feel safe, I feel warm and powerful. It's helpful in the gym, an argument, when I feel misunderstood, or when something happens that isn't justified. It's great for everything, but it's a concern to me that this is the only emotion which makes me feel energized.

If I'm not angry, I'm depressed or tired. I don't know what to do.

I'm a 21 y/o male who's a bouncer and works out consistently. And a lot of the time I just want to cry, anger feels like my imaginary friend that keeps me safe. It's not healthy.",1
"If I feel I am being attacked, I go for the jugular. I get disproportionately angry. I can’t let people think they’re right if I don’t think they are, even if doing this makes the situation worse or creates a problem out of nothing. The thought of other people being smug about something boils my blood. Saying “sorry, yes you’re right” would immediately fix the situation, any other tactic is unlikely to fix this... but I just can’t.  I hate coming across as weak so heavily overcompensate with aggression.

I got into this mess because I was being passive aggressive about something that had nothing to do with me.. Which is another anger problem I have. 

Also, my face twitches and I go red when angry but I also tear up in certain situations and can't breath. 

Usually my anger is under control. I didn't even realise I was capable of being this angry any more but at the moment, in this situation, it is the worst its been in 10 years. 

I don’t know how I’m going to be in any way constructive in this meeting but under no circumstances can this meeting result in a falling out. I’m supposed to be having this meeting in a few weeks.",1

"Hi!
I am going into therapy this Saturday. My anger has really been getting out of control and seeping into violence. I finally decided to bite the bullet and seek professional help.
However, this is not the first time seeking help. Somehow, I seem to have a run-in with poor therapists. The kind who just prescribe a bunch of medicines and barely talk.
A part of this is also my fault, as I am often all over the place every single time I have gone for a session. But this time I am going with a focused approach, I am going to specifically talk about my anger issues. Most of my other problems are anyway related to anger.
Either way, do you guys have any tips to share with me? Should I prepare some notes and go? Like note down my triggers? What questions should I ask my therapist to know if they can really work out my issue? I am up for any thoughts or opinions anybody has.
I know it's not going to be easy. But this time, I plan on being regular and consistent.
Thanks in advance.",1
Is anyone else a lot less angry when drunk?,1
"I have a problem... 

I work in the male-dominated industry of security for a Fortune-500 company. I have a problem, I don't like being told what to do by my male co-workers and I tend to argue with them a lot when they try to control me because of my mere womanhood. I will never ask for the help of another man unless it's my supervisor or another female. It's just an issue I have with my co-workers when they try to be controlling for no reason; we all get paid the same. I am also a few years older than them and some of them are immature to me. I know they probably think I'm a bitch, but I'm trying to make a point that I can not be manipulated or taken advantage of. I set solid boundaries with men at work and I speak up if there is an injustice. Some of the men at my job have slept with other co-workers, flirt with them, etc. I want them to know that I can not be fucked with. 

Overall, I realize it's unprofessional so what can I do to avoid losing my temper? How will my co-workers view me after losing it sometimes - not all the time.",1
"Hello all. I'm running into a lot of issues lately with regards to anger.

I've always had a really short fuse and an irritable temper, but lately it's gotten a lot worse. I have a really hard time not sounding genuinely annoyed when people make me repeat myself, or raising my voice. I'm having a hard time keeping my composure as of late. I live with my family, with my my grandparents to be specific, and I always feel terrible when they ask me to repeat myself and I start raising my voice almost on instinct. I try to run it back but the damage is almost always done. 

I'm a teacher; I teach in the private sector, which means I usually don't have to deal with much frustration at work, but lately a lot of students have noted that I seem quick to anger when i have to repeat myself too much, or when students joke around too much with me (which they only do because I try to make them feel comfortable around me and I myself get really jokey during classes). Not only does this really worry me on a personal level, since I just don't want to be that kind of person, but also from a professional point of view this could severely damage my career.

I've never dealt with this before and I don't know what to do or even how to begin to address this, so if anyone (especially in particular any fellow teachers) has any tips to help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it.",1
"Long story short, I'm a 21 y/o sap who is just fucking tired of giving women my entire soul and heart just to have them love me back for a year or two then suddenly their feelings change.

"Hello. 

Just looking for some support, advice, or hope that I can get through this and get better. 


I have a huge anger problem. For the past month I've been trying to overcome it as I think it's related to my anxiety. Therapy, sport, stopped smoking weed, relaxation techniques...


But I just seem to not be able. Worst is that when I'm calm, I realize how crazy I went. And i feel ashamed. 


Just today I had an argument with my boyfriend. He got a bit upset about some plan changes, nothing too big. I tried to cheer him up but he was a bit meh. I went quiet although I could already feel the anger coming up. Because I didn't understand why he was upset. Then he said something like ""Whatever"". And I snapped. Like I felt he came back to state once again he was upset and I snapped. Literallly sent a voice note saying fuck you, fuck this, you're an asshole you're this and that. All that shouting. 


Then he called me like wait wait wait alright I got upset but calm down... And I just couldn't. Kept saying mean things. Shouting. Insults. 


He was like please calm down, You can't think right now but you're going too far let's talk like human beings. Stop saying all that, you're hurting me. 

And it feels the more he tells me to stop, the more anger I get. I get to a point where he obviously snaps too, and I use that. Instead of apologizing, I make him apologize. And he's always like wtf you didn't say sorry, why dl I have to. And if he does, but says something bad, I snap again. 


I can't seem to stop even when sometimes while I'm so mad I know that I'm gonna regret it. I know I'm going too far. But I keep on like that for a while and then suddenly jusr get calm and be depressed and guilty and ashamed.  


I don't want to be like this. But I feel my body temperature raising, my brain going cloudy and just hate coming out of my mouth. 

I'm not like this with everyone. I can control myself (even tho I still feel the anger) around job colleagues, friends, etc. But with family and my boyfriend I just snap and go nuts on them. 

Why? Why is this? Is it possible to overcome this without medication? I'm fucking my life.up as well as other people's. 

Because a normal argument wouldn't cause so many problems, or last this long. 

I hate being me.",1
" I'm 29, male.

I'm  usually a grounded and good person, yet when I start to drink I just  can't stop, and every time it's a Russian roulette. I can switch for no  reason and spiral out of control. It's been a kind of auto-destructive  behavior since I was 15, the better my life is the worse it gets. Now  I'm starting to become violent when it happen, I haven't armed anyone  yet but it's scaring me. When I enter this phase there's no coming back  until exhaustion or passing out. It's ruining my life and the other's  around me. This night it happened again and my gf can't take it anymore,  and me neither.

All my childhood  I've been into conflicts, my mother was mixing alcohol and drugs,  destroying everything and having a burning rage inside her while my  father was doing night-shifts. I don't have any brother or sister, so  for years I spent my life alone like that. There's no doubt I'm  traumatized somehow and repeating the abuse I lived as a kid. I can't  let it happen I don't want to be like that.

I  know the immediate solution is to quit drinking, this was my plan since  last month, yesterday was an exception and it went wrong. I now decided  to never have a drink anymore, I'm done with that, but there's still  that thing in me I have to take care of otherwise I fear it'll come back  again through something else.

Please I need help I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I have all the answers but I visibly can't solve this myself.  
I'm  planning on getting professional help soon, but I don't have the more  stable financial situation and it's possible I won't be able to afford a  properly scheduled treatment, so I try to get help from here because I can't let things going this way anymore.",1
"Personally, I was born with a short fuse. No trauma caused it, I was just born like that. Mind you, you probably have this image of someone who always was angry, but I was calm most of the time, I just knew no other way to express negative emotions but to flip out. I learned how to keep all my feelings inside, but that didn't last. For a couple of years, I was in denial about everything. Not only did I learn how to bottle up my anger, I also learned how to fake every other aspect of my personality. I was in the sunken place, and I don't wanna go back to that. Now, I'm a really angry person. The difference now compared to before is that my anger actually is trauma-based this time, and there's also an aspect of being angsty that I can't just flip out the way I want it and when I want it. I've learned that so many aspects of my individuality that I repressed weren't actually bad, but anger apparently is and it still bugs me.",1
"So I just failed my second college class (I passed general psychology and humanities, failed remedial math part 2 and intro into environmental science).  

When I think about how angry I am it isn't because I failed the course, I've already put in my classes for next semester. Sure I might get put on probation but I'm trying. What hurts the most is the lies I have to tell.

When I'm at work I have friends that for some reason look up to me. A damn engineering student ran up to me one day telling me he passed his exam with an A+. I'm not this guys parents and I feel like a fraud. My highest grade in any college class so far is a B+ and everything I've passed with a C+. I also have a female colleague who's finishing up her bachelors and she thinks I'm some sort of genious.

It hurts even more with the fact that my mom is a narcissist so in her eyes I'm supposed to be the golden boy who makes straight A+s and makes her look good. I'm not allowed to say my grades out loud and she'll shut me up if I do so nobody can hear.

I've been laying in bed all day, I took a nap but I still ain't feeling alright so I just wanted to share that here.",1

I usually get mad at her for being so annoying when I'm playing games, calling me multiple times even when I told her I'm going and when she yells at me.

"Today a lady at my kids school was backing up her truck so i honked and was about to hit me. She kept going so i honked again. Then she started making faces at me in the mirror. The whole time we were backed up going around the parking lot to get out for like 10 minutes. I tried to fucking calm down. Don't look at her. Ok she's sticking her toungue out. Look away. Move up a little with the cars so i have to look ahead more faces and a finger. And in my head I was just like ""come on then bitch. Get out and come here and do something. She's screwing up her face and mouthing something at me. Calm down. Fucking calm down. I let another woman who wanted to back up get in front of me so there would be someone between us. Thing is, I might see her tomorrow and I'm going to try really hard to aboid her but if she says anything I might snap. I am trying really hard to be a good person. Every day do at least one good thing to make someone feel better. A compliment. A silent prayer or little gift. Do better for my community. I don't want to be so angry. I want to be better.",1

"I will acknowledge that I have received an excellent education throughout my life and have access to resources that others may not, including therapy, teachers who encourage critical thinking skills, and being considered “gifted” from a young age, yada yada yada. What I’m referring to here is, I get so angry when other people do not think as critically or thoughtfully about things as I do. I also have a tendency to think that anyone whose beliefs are not the same as mine are less intelligent than me. It makes me not want to be around people my age because they annoy me/frustrate me so much by how stupid they are. 

The more I think about it, I tend to think that I’m the smartest person I know, and I can only respect people who I perceive as equally intelligent as me, if not more. I thought that it was narcissism for a while, but I do not think that this feeling comes from insecurity. Can anyone relate?",1
"I am in a 2 year relationship with an aspie partner with anger issues which result in insecurities and self victimization. Medicine, therapy, and just slowly getting life organized one by one is what we do to help maintain the relationship.

In the past people would sometimes speak to me in a condescending way  while using my name. Like ‘you should know this by now, *Alex*’. Or shout my name at me as if I was a dog. So I think these experiences have caused me to associate my name with being condescended to, hence why I don’t like hearing it now.

"I'm suffering because I have no anger management skills in that I don't know how to let it out. Here's my situation: I have a husband suffering from severe depression who is wonderful in every way, supportive, good cook, excellent human but who I worry about constantly as his depression and unfounded self-loathing impedes his job search. I have a housemate with severe depression until my husband wakes her up. I  am constantly worried she is trying to replace me; she sleeps in til noon because depression and does all the things I wish I could do to become a more charming person except I'm exhausted cleaning toilets and keeping the bills paid. She shows guests my husband's hobby stuff as if she were the wife and not me. Apparently I'm being paranoid when I get bothered about this kind of thing - she's just doing things as a friend would. She started off as a friend but lately I can't help but feel angry and resentful of her.

I'm so angry at both of them for putting so much pressure on me (financially, emotionally, they want a certain standard of cleanliness but can't do it themselves because depression). I REALLY want to kick the housemate out but I can't because she's his friend and she pays rent and is the one person I can grudgingly count on to prevent my husband from doing self-harm. 

The people who are the source of much of my anger are so fragile emotionally that I can't say shit to them.

I want to rage about this stressful situation to my parents but I can't because they'd probably start to dislike him. I can't tell anybody, I can only go to counselling, and sometimes I get advice that seems to make my whole situation worse. Lately I just want to smash things through windows and set things on fire (in a safe and controlled environment) but I can't do that. What do you do, angry and stressed people, when you feel so much anger you just want to explode?",1

So I blame her why my sisters gone (which is the reason). I've been bullied ever since I was a little kid, every day I'd go over my friends house and have outbursts of anger then I'd get kicked out and it would happen again, again and again until they moved out.

I have quite a few friends that I'm happy to chill with but I do have trust issues and I worry constantly about what's gonna happen next, or am I doing everything wrong.) 

I just needed to post this because yet again I'm worrying about everything",1
"I am a very angry person and I can’t control it, I will yell even in public so loud and sometimes throw, hit etc things. My whole life my mother yelled at us for everything and I never saw any other parent like that.  My dad wasn’t around much but he was a drunk and I saw him hurt my mom badly and I saw him break things like he broke the door down with a hammer to get to my mom. He broke her elbow with the cover of a charcoal grill. Also my step father I saw him break my moms nose and he shot my brother who was 9 at the time with a BB gun. He is in prison for 16 years for setting our house on fire with my family inside. My dad died from a drug overdose. My mom would yell loud and angry and make us feel like shit. She also blamed us for stuff like if she forgot her cigarettes it was our fault because we had the tv too loud, she would twist stuff to make our fault. I have a sister and a brother. My sister isn’t too bad she is just very emotional but my brother is like me although I don’t think it is as bad. I spent my whole childhood being yelled at for everything; things I did, things I didn’t do, and she would yell then disappear for a few mins then she would come back yell some more. I am like her. I get angry a lot and I can’t control it and I yell and the worst things I’ve done is probably scream in public, violently destroy people’s things, and tried to hit my ex with my car about 10 years ago (I was angry I caught them cheating) they got out of the way and I hit 2 parked cars and a house and did a lot of damage. I am way beyond normal and I am just so tired of feeling like this. Did anyone else experience this sort of thing and are now an angry person too?",1
A customer said that to me because they asked for a discount on an item and I said no. I was also having bad death anxiety so had no patience. Ugh. Randomly felt like sharing this.,1
"I've never acted on my impulses, but I'm afraid the sudden and intense anger I feel for the simplest things might make me sick someday. 

I went through some bad stuff, mostly which I consider solved, I've accepted what happened and try to keep past things in the past. 

But what once was depression turned into this explosive anger. I get angry solely because of my brother's existence. I can't share the same room as him and it makes me want to punch him in the face so badly. I'd blame it on the mess he always makes wherever he goes, I always try to help him, talk to him, be there for him, but he can't do a single thing right and this makes me extremely angry. I've broke a part of our house's fridge once when I was mad at him.

Same goes with random people at the street, sometimes I get angry for a random reason and anyone next to me becomes a victim in my mind and I really hate to feel like this. 

I've never actually hurt anyone, but I'm known for my short temper. It makes me feel extremely guilty of feeling like this since I have no idea how to deal with it. Any help would be welcome.",1
"my parents piss me off, 

i have severe depression and anxiety and i don’t really have any emotion toward my parents, or anybody for that matter, but recently i’ve just been so angry at them, the small things they do - if my dad starts dozing off on the couch i have an anxiety attack as a result of my anger, but i never take it out on them, i can contain it well - though when i’m angry i feel like harming myself in some way, whether it be biting my hand as hard as i can or pinching myself almost as if i’m trying to control my feeling.

my dad is a short tempered person, and i always feel intimidated around him. if he sits next to me on the couch or in the car i feel really on edge, like he’s about to scream at me or shout at me for no reason even when i know that he’s not, and it’s the same with random strangers, if i order a coffee and say the wrong order i immediately feel like the barista is going to get angry at me though in this situation the feeling is more anxiety then anger.

any ideas to why i feel this way, and why i am only angry at my parents, and never strangers or friends?",1
"It's like I literally can't do anything without getting angry for some reason or another. It's almost subconcious at this point. Like I get more pissed that I'm actually getting angry in general than the thing that supposedly set me off. I want to delete this emotion from my body entirely because it is ruining my life. 

How can I work to reduce my anger as a whole? 

I don't want to have to manage this stupid emotion that does more harm than good. I'd rather it just not exist and I'm jealous of people that don't have to deal with this ""thing"".",1
"I've been called extremely nice, warm, welcoming, kind, and sweet by almost everyone I've met (and ill admit, I work for those compliments due to my anxiety to set a good first impression). However, once a person I really know takes advantage or is terribly rude to me, I lose control and let out the most spiteful stubborn asshole in the world to go and hurt them back. How can I fix this? Got dumped because of this lol so I'm super motivated to fix this trait",1
"I notice I’m becoming really aggressive in the car. Like today I was trying to merge &amp; this guy wouldn’t let me in, so I honked a lot. Then when the light turned green I laid on the horn, &amp; followed him really close for a while. Also I took a photo of his license.

... I’m starting to realize my anger problem is getting worse. I might hurt someone if I don’t think straight.",1
A lot of things have been going on lately to make me pissed. This morning I lifted weights and it was a wonderful and terrifying experience.  I usually feel a little pain while lifting but this morning I felt none.  The workout seemed really easy even though my heart rate monitor I was wearing said it was 175 bpm.  I don’t know what it was at the end of the workout because the strap around my chest holding the heart rate monitor in place fell off during my last set.  Luckily I didn’t hurt myself and didn’t let myself lift more even though I wanted to. Not sure if this is the right sub for this so if it isn’t I apologize.  Hope everyone is having a good morning.,1
"So on my bullshit job tonight I came inches away from going to jail because we have a new cunt who somehow gotta a promotion (sucking of the bosses presumably) and he's been fucking with me for the past few days. Tonight it all came to a head when his dumb ass told me to do something and the shit was wrong, so he and the other managers had a circle jerk laugh and he told me quote, ""you need to use your brain, maybe you know, think a little"".

I was infuriated! I've calmed down now that I'm in the car but I wanted to fuck him up. I wanted to kill him, I wanted to END HIS LIFE but I'm not a fighter. I've never hurt anyone and I never treat people bad. But it makes me mad when I have to bow down to some fucking clown that should have been aborted.

But enough about him and the managers. This happens all the time. On my last job my manager yelled at me for no reason because she thought I did something wrong and I lost it when I got in the car. I damn near broke the car window because I was so pissed.

When I get angry I feel inferior, like small. When I was younger I was bullied because I was short and nerdy and it was, ""funny"" when I got angry and it still happens today IN THE FUCKING WORKPLACE where people are supposed to be PROFESSIONAL and kind yet all the assholes get the promotions and people like me get talked down to.

I don't ask for much. I'm not just some lazy dumb guy (though that's what society says I'm supposed to be since I'm black). I just want to be treated with respect but I'm struggling and I know I have to deal with it because I need a job. Since I can't change it I know I have to adapt and overcome. How can I conrol my temper and my anger and put up with these fucking pitiful ass people in our society?",1
"So girlfriend and i had broke just a couple weeks ago, she blocks my number. Okay, cool. 
I end up getting her to do me a favor for the first time ever and give her some money to go get things. She blocks me again and doesn't lmk about anything. 
I went to her house last night to get my money back, and her friend and friend's dealer pulled up to the house. He kept laying his hands on me and yelling over me whenever i went to talk to my ex about getting my money back. I almost killed him. Nobody lays their hands on me. 

I realized the brevity of the situation and instead of lashing out, I kept calmly telling him to let me go and kept asking her where my money is. This dude got actually threatening with me. Her mom threatens to call the cops. The dealer and my ex's friend left, and the whole time I was trying to keep calm and keep it together. But I don't know if i can keep control anymore.",1
"My dog who I’ve lived with almost my entire life, was found to be an illness common Australian Shepherds who usually lead to their death. I can’t think of anything except isolate myself and just holes into walls, snapping objects, cutting myself, ripping books, and breaking literally anything. I’ve never been so close to anything ever. Not my mom my dad my brother nothing. When I arrive from school I always call his name for a treat or stomach tickles. And soon I will have to call his name and not get a response. He has no idea what might happened but he’s hurt by how i’ve been acting the past few days i’ve sleep next to him on the floor with my arms around him and he feels confused how to feel. Any help would be helpful, i don’t want to lose him or my mentality. i’ve had a bad experience with anger issues, school fights over small things, breaking drywall, attempted suicides, breaking things that are important to me. Please just anything that would make me feel better these couple days and weeks. I’ve never feel this broken ever.",1
So when I was going to play on my ps4 my brother said I’m playing stupid thing to get mad over but I punched my phone and my knuckles got bloody,1
 I pretty much get angry everytime I play halo 5. What do I do?,1
"The first thing is that I try to seriously limit myself to constant political videos and channels with constant updates, especially with the political climate in our country right now. I still like to stay informed, but instead of watching a video everyday, I will watch a video once a week or two weeks. 

The second one is that when I'm feeling angry, anxious, or just any other ""not so good"" feeling, I pop my headphones (or a single headphone) in and go onto YouTube and listen to ""lofi beats"". Some say that if you're sad or angry to avoid music because it can amplify how your feeling, I found that lofi music beats (Japanese lofi to be exact) really has a way of calming me down or putting me in a better mood, personally I think it's because of the high lack of lyrics where it let's my brain shut all the ""bad vibes"" out. 

I'm not saying this will work for everyone, but it's definitely worth trying. Hope you all have a good one!",1
"I am a 21 year old male who has a lot of anger inside and I get mad at even the slightest things. When someone disrespects me, I act polite but firm. There are times where I'm a little aggressive, because I can't fight the urge to beat them to death or starting yelling. I'm not scared to start a fight. I have a loving girlfriend who I have never hit but has experienced some of my outburst. I always feel bad and I wish I didn't have all this toxic stuff inside. Right now one of my coworkers is a narcissistic prick that I want to put down but I don't want to waste my time going to jail for that. He constantly over steps even though we have no business. I hold back because I have to be civil.

I grew up in a poor home with an abusive narcissitic father and a schizo mother. I would stand up to my father and still talk shit even when he would hit, verbally abuse and even spit on me. My siblings and I would fight our father when he was abusing our mother while she was ill. He only ever made her worse. I always wanted to kill or beat him and even told him he would be afraid of me one day.

We finally left him to live my aunt when I was in middle school. I started working out and doing martial arts to be a stress reliever for all that pent up rage. I thought about murder so often.  We spent a few years without him in peace. We got our own place and moved from my aunts. My sophmore year, he weasled his way back into our home. My mom is a bit of a pushover and everything went downhill from there. He got drunk and started talk shit about my older sister who moved out with her boyfriend. So I confronted him and got into an argument. 

Over the next 2 years or so, things only got worse. I stayed away from home a lot as I was always doing school sports and focusing on getting out of my situation. But that bastards toxicity just kept seeping in. My mom was becoming unwell because he would bother her while she was sleeping and he was always talking shit. When I would catch him bothering my mom or brother, we would argue. I was going through a lot of shit with school already being an AP student and friends and all that social stuff. I got to the point where the fights started getting physcial. I was messing him up because of my martial arts training. He would never shut up so I just couldn't take it anymore. It got so bad that I broke his arm and put a gash in his head with an elbow strike. Blood was pouring out and I thought I would end up in prison. He didn't press charges and was too scared of me anyway. I kicked him out a few months after that because he was starting shit. I took everything he had and tossed it outside. Everything was just falling apart apart at that point. I quit school cause I was so depressed and angry I was suicidal. There are a lot of other things but I don't want to throw them in because of the length. My life is a shit show lol

I know that I am equipped and very capable of doing harm to people. Despite that, I don't want to do it because jail time isn't worth it. But I'm not sure how to deal with my anger, especially when feeling disrespected. I often just ignore the disrepect and then it flares up later. It's how I prevent myself from stabbing someone. I just want to live a nice fulfilling life, but then someone comes along and tries to denigrate me. Most often it's some coworker who has an issue with me for no reason. Such has happened at my previous job and now at this one. I used to be an assistant manager at a gym and I got shit done even if I gave lip to my manager. I was their right hand and this other guy always tried to one up me and talk shit behind my back. But he kept fucking up. Now I got desk customer service job and  this narcissist is always trying to prove he is better than me or making comments that are unwarranted.",1
For about 2 hours i was in a fit of rage driving in traffic only to be even more pissed off once i got out of my car. I was with my girlfriend and her sister and i could tell i was ruining the mood so i excused myself and sat down and tried to breath. It didnt work so well so i decided to go on this sub. I found some posts about control and how we arent in control of others’ behaviors and put things in perspective for me. I cant change their behavior but i can change mine. Its a constant struggle but this subreddit proved to be very helpful in calming me down.,1
I have a huge anger problem. I get very irtitated and annoyed with people when they haven't really said anything to annoy me. I also keep alot of grudges against people who i feel wronged by.,1
"Hi there,

I have long suffered from anger management issues and I'm realizing that I really need to do something about it to live a better life and to be happier on a day-to-day basis.  For what seems like forever, I've always had very little patience and a quick fuse.  I'm constantly fuming if I'm driving and I'm stuck behind another car, seething if something delays me, or angry if someone disagrees with me at work (internally, not outwardly so).  There are times when something happens and I just snap and see red, for example, my girlfriend dropped a full coffee pot by accident and I yelled at her.  I apologized and we are doing well (engaged, actually), but I want to get a handle on these outbursts and have more control over myself when I am angry.  I was hoping someone could suggest some good places to start or some good advice.  I realize that a lifetime of this isn't going to change overnight, but I want to do what I can to see real progress in controlling my temper. 

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.",1
I’m pissed at the way my life is going. I feel like life is kicking my ass and I can’t catch a break I decided to start an argument with my uncle and said some awful things. Then I called my mom and called her a bitch and a cunt for not aborting me.,1
"I have so much anger in my life and i have no clue what to do with it, i have my outlets like working out, video games or being at school, but i got only 1 year of school left and I’m already terrified of post college life, I have so much i want to do and say and can’t i feel so stuck, i want to talk to someone but i can’t, it’s so complicated, i can’t keep bottling up these emotions tho, i would really like someone to talk to (outside of my school counselor, I’m not at school at the moment so i can’t really talk to her)",1
"This is a follow-up of what I said yesterday, although it actually happened last night. I couldn't handle myself and I accidentally broke something, and my stepdad came out shouting at me. He'd done this before and I clammed up, this time I said that I was ""fucking angry"" and that he was ""useless"" because shouting didn't help me. When my mom came out, I called her a ""fucking cunt"" a few times, which I feel awful about. Never used those words before but I just had to. Well, I've apologised to her but not my stepdad, who I've not spoken to. They want to try to have ""meetings"" or some horse-shit about this. All I want to do is lob myself off the balcony. We've been on holiday for a week and we're going home today, so I'll only be able to read anything you say now or late in the day.",1
"I can be very petty and can be prone to anger in rare cases and I really wanna fix it.

**Games** 

I don’t always get angry or mad when it comes to games, but I can make passive comments when it comes to casual and can bite my tongue almost every second in ranked games. I feel like it stems from wanting to be the best, and such. I see all these people. I put the same amount of hours and they become famous and pro. I really want to become a professional gamer and I know it’s a distant dream **millions** of players try to achieve. I try to hit high ranks which I achieve for a example Overwatch I reached top 1% (Grandmasters) but lost it and fell into top 3%.

I don’t have perfect mechanical skill in games, or good hand eye coordination, but it’s gotten a lot better to the point where I’m at the top 3, but I want to push further and every time I lost I self critique myself in a toxic manner. I get mad, frustrated and call myself stupid. I play another game which is a strategy game I’m fairly high up in that game I place units, but feel anxious and when I lose I see nothing but anger saying how I could be so stupid to make a horrible mistake.

When it comes to my friends they sometimes make sly comments to each other like lol nice aim or such and that passiveness drives me to overreact and lash out. It’s rare, but happens too.

All I wanna do is be the best and I know that’s where the anger comes from the shame comes from. Whether it’s in real life, in-game I want people not to notice me it’s not attention anger, more I wanna be the best at something I care about and put hours into. 

“How Egotistical is he” 

“He’s Delusional”

“Not everybody can be the best at everything maybe you don’t have what it takes”

I can guess you’re judging, it’s not me being crazy paranoid more wanting to get rid the basic comments and have more complex answers.

I have a dedication type of personality (or part of my whole personality) and I want to be beyond excellent at all I do and those little comments, those little mistakes make me so mad and I don’t know how to deal with it sometimes. It’s less of long term anger, but more of a short-term burst.

Any help on how to deal with it and personal experience would be great thanks y’all.",1
"My parents have never tried to aid me at all when I'm angry. I'm just not allowed to be, and so I bottle it up and desire to do, as many here are surely familiar with, reprehensible, extremist thing. My mom will shout at me, and even when I'm extremely pissed off, with my dad/stepdad in close proximity, I don't have the courage to yell at my mother. I can't channel my anger in social settings, so I just break my own things and act sheepishly to my mom. I fucking hate my stepdad, he whistles and sings all the time in the most putrid way, and the way he talks to normal, decent people with totally underserved, unimpressive ostentatiousness makes me want to kill him. My dad is an angry little fuck, and he's gotten threatening with me before, evem those he's smaller. I want nothing more than to call them all ""cunt"" and shout them down like they all have to me. Just to punch my stepdad's teeth out would be the greatest fucking thing.",1
"I lost my fucking job, some dude fucking played me and tries to continue.

"I will try my best to make this concise. I use to think that I had anxiety issues but after trying many different things, regular prayer, exercise, healthy eating, medication, practicing socializing, I am seriously running out of solutions. 

Here is what happens to me in public; every time someone is being friendly with me I become upset and when someone is hostile towards me I am calm. The thought of someone provoking a fight with me is unnaturally soothing. If I am dealing with repressed anger **is it possible that anger can hijack your ability to communicate and socialize with people regularly?** If so, how do you meaningfully reduce your anger?

Has this ever happened to anyone?",1
"My husband is pretty wonderful overall, but in recent years he’s started getting very angry over very small things and he’s started being more controlling. This might happen 2x per month. Things which used to be small arguments or even just general discussions of problem/solution have turned into huge fights where his anger manifests as personal attack’s towards me. I feel extremely hurt when he does this, even though I know he is not in control sometimes.

Examples:
1.  I asked “what?” (As in—repeat yourself) too many times in one conversation, in his opinion. Caused him to berate and yell at me and order me to never say that word again ever in my life. 

2. Dogs bowl is low on water. He got so angry that he goes off on a screaming tirade for several minutes, yelling at me and accuses of me of wanting to kill our dog. 

Without spelling out the entire back and forth, he gets unreasonably angry and yells at me, blames me, takes no responsibility for his part of the issue (eg: not acknowledging he talks fast or acknowledging that we both are responsible for keeping our dog fed and watered) 

These are just two random examples... it sometimes feels borderline emotionally abusive.

We have talked about these fights days later when I’m still hurt, he says that he doesn’t really remember the details of them but is sorry for yelling at me, and embarrassed for the way he’s acted. He acknowledges that there’s still an issue but that he handles it poorly. He said that he gets 10x more angry at work and that all his coworkers have turned on him and he basically has no friends at work anymore.

The last time it happened I asked him to leave our house. Our daughter is only 1 and I don’t want her growing up around the yelling and the mean-ness. After a day apart, we talked and he agreed to see a doctor and I’d support him on his path to self improvement. 

Can anyone offer me advice on how to support him while he seeks help controlling his rage?

Thank you for reading",1
"Life is not perfect is what I remind myself, I've been staying in my own lane doing my best, being a better listener. Having put up recently with a few family member who were  having a few rage fits of their own. 

Long story short, I take responsibility for my 'moment', but after a year and a half of meetings with various different people to get a project off the ground. Feeling like I'm repeating myself over and over again and now being in a program where I get to go into further development. Then in said meeting when someone finally said what I had said over and over again - I snapped. It wasn't major but I got a snitty little attitude that made me look like a 15 year old. 

A week later and still feel like an ass, plus I was moved out of that module into a different group. I tried to explain but that's anger issues for you and it seems you only get one chance various situations. 

I believe it will all work out - maybe I was looking for too much external validation - which I probably was. 

I'm moving past it but sometimes it's a challenge.",1
"(M25) Lately I've been wanting to make changes in my life like go travelling and take up hobbies etc. And I want to be able tell family and talk about it but instead of saying ""oh that's great"" and ask me more about it they always respond with ""you should do this and you should do that"". 

I told my mom yesterday I was looking at hotels for Croatia soon hoping she'll want to hear all about it but her response was ""you should stay in hostels so you can meet people"" 

As well today I told my sister I wanted to start going to the gym once I finish my dissertation and she said ""oh you should join that community gym I told you about, its a great way to meet people and they go on adventures."" And when I tell her maybe or I'm not looking to socialise she gets all disappointed and doesn't take no for an answer. Its like ffs can't I just do certain things in solitude? I feel like it just shows a lack of interest and it gets to a point where it becomes really frustrating especially if they keep repeating it and when I say it to them they just get all defensive or joke about it which frustrates me even more. I end up just not bringing it up because it just won't go the way I want it to.

I want more from this life but I'm so tired of waiting until I can. Waiting constantly and constantly disappointed. I'm sick of it. I want a different life, and to experience new things and meet people! I'm tired of being the way I am, introverted, socially anxious, and childishly sensitive. Also with feeling childish, I feel that way when I get angry because I cry when I'm really frustrated.

I want to punch something, throw things around, just anything violent but safe. I'm tired.",1
"A little bit about me, I was diagnosed with depression this year once I realised that I was getting sad a lot more frequently with it being more pronounced. A lot of it stems from bring an emotional kid (crying EVERY day over the littlest things) and being told to just stop crying in high school or I'll get bullied.

So, I did just that and bottled up all my emotions for the past 9 years, with me just about to finish uni this semester. However, this year I've been losing all my distractions that have let me ignore my emotions, as I'm no longer enjoying my studies which has forced me to confront my actual feelings.

Unfortunately, for the past 9 years I've got it stuck in my head that showing any emotion is a weakness. Any form of vulnerability is a weakness. Standing down from your views (no matter how wrong) is a weakness. And thus I have become so much more defensive and instead of simply crying, my first response to anything I don't agree with/anything that upsets me is to express myself with anger and then cry.

I have hurt my family's feelings on so many different occasions with my outbursts, saying things I don't mean but strangely feeling a need to stick by what I said because ""I don't want to be proven wrong and back down"". Even today I had a disagreement and called 3 of my family members idiots, even though I couldn't properly come up with a coherent sentence. Like, I know what's going on in my head but I can't tell them properly coz I'm getting upset and angry. In turn, I feel like they aren't properly listening or understanding what I'm saying and are just using any attempt to belittle me. 

Was I in the wrong for calling them idiots and making them upset with me? Of course I was. But I can't apologise to them coz I've got too much of this stupid pride in not wanting to back down. 

I feel like every argument I'm having with them is fracturing my relationships with them, but I just can't stop. I constantly think that maybe it'd be best to move out of home even though I have next to no money because I'm hurting them. But in the same token I am twisted in thinking that I should move out as that will hurt them too. I don't really want to hurt them, I love my family to pieces and I know they care for and are worried about me, but I don't know how to stop getting angry all the time. I just don't know what to do.

Sorry for the rant, I've just had a very emotional day today.",1
"Lately I’ve been angry at life and a few general things within my life, some situations and people (most of it unjustified).

I can’t keep doing this but I have legitimately no idea how to be happy like I have been in the past around my SO :/

"I want to beat the living shit out of this piece of shit my girl used to date. He took advantage of her many times and even raped her a few times. She is passive and didn't report him or anything. I am just finding out about this. I have his address and tomorrow I'll go over knock on his door, and smash his fucking brains in. Any reason why I shouldn't?",1
"I talk to my mom about my problems. She’s not great, but I don’t have anyone else I feel comfortable telling so I end up telling her. I started throwing things at her because I just felt like she wasn’t listening. I was trying to talk about a conflict between a friend and I, and she wasn’t hearing my point of view and kept on being like ‘you were horrible to that friend’, ‘you attacked them for no reason’ when I showed her a text message discussion that we were having. I started crying and saying ‘no one’s on my side, no one supports me’. Growing up, she sometimes didn’t believe me when I told her I was being bullied. So I overreact if it happens in the present. 

It’s a problem. Every single time, I tell myself ‘I won’t talk to her again about my problems’ but I hate bottling things up and I need to tell SOMEONE. Can anyone relate?",1
"This has never happened to me like this before. I got really mad because I was on my way driving to an appointment today and got stopped to wait for like 300 people crossing the road for a “fun run.” The flagger was defensive when I asked him if they were going to let us through at all. I’m betting he’d already beed yelled at all day. I went to take another route and that was messed up too. I was going the speed limit, but the flaggers decided I was going to fast and started yelling at me. Two jumped in front of my car to stop me. I screamed at them. I’m so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. But more, I’m scared that it could happen again. Is there something wrong with me? How do I catch this if it happens again? I’d be grateful for any suggestions.",1
"Hello, this is the first time I’ve posted here so please bare with me. I’m just don’t know how far I have.  I just feel like too much is hitting me at once. I’m just done with everything. I can’t take it anymore. I just want to go back to my old self. I was in a relationship with this girl for 8 months and I loved her but she played me for a fool. She manipulated me and even got physical with me. Now, I have a protective order against. I have to go to counseling every Friday to deal with everything. I just lost a good friend to suicide. I’m broke, I’m lonely, I don’t talk to anyone, I’m always so angry, I’m legit just sit in my room all day. I’m falling apart. I just fucking destroyed my room looking for a shirt. A bloody Tee shirt. I’m losing my mind",1

Now after day 3 of more crap I have exploded and everything has pissed me off.
My car bluetooth,my flashlight at work,traffic doesn't help,my thoughts grow angrier and angrier as the day goes on and my vain is aching.

"Backstory is I have this massive asshole colleague that I share an office with. She’s quick to micromanage me, although she’s not in charge of me at all. She’s also lazy as all hell, with me answering most calls and dealing with most of our crazy clients. After a full week of it, my already short-fused self is completely burnt out. 


Today she raised her voice at me in front of a bunch of clients and I flipped the fuck out. I couldn’t see anything, just blurs of red and black, and I couldn’t even begin to remember the shit spewing out of my mouth. I stomped away and ended up getting written up and have a meeting with HR on Monday. Even though she “started it” I’m the asshole for throwing a hissy fit, and I understand that. 

I regret getting SO mad and SO out of control. I wish I just politely told her to fuck off or something. I don’t know. This sucks... and now everyone at work thinks I’m a tool. Which I kind of am. I guess. 

Anyways. 

Hopefully one of the eighty million therapists I called today while give me a ring back so I can hopefully not get fired.",1

"I’m disappointed with myself. I haven’t truly lost my cool since January, when I thought I was going to hit a co-worker.

I was parked at an intersection and this guy drove across the crosswalk right in front of my car. He came out of nowhere &amp; nearly hit me, I nearly had a heart attack.

He parked in front of the store so I drove in after him and started yelling at him through the window, he ignored me. I jumped out of the car, I was so furious. He said it was my fault, my car was “in the way” and he didn’t come anywhere near my car.

I was pissed, this calm a*hole was totally in the wrong, nearly caused an accident, &amp; wasn’t even going to apologize. I took a photo of his license, &amp; one of him. I said some very rude things as well.

.... I guess I’m disappointed that I lost my cool. I was 100% in the right, until I started yelling and swearing. Then I’m just a crazy person in a parking lot. I should’ve just driven away, but in the moment I stopped thinking.

.... :(",1
"I've been dealing with this for quite some time now. More than a decade to say the least. Everytime I lose it, I always end up beating myself up or throwing a rage and smashing everything in sight. Also comes with it, my suicidal thoughts. Which, for the record, doesn't end up well with my anger issues. 

My anger comes from way back to childhood and it just continued to build up as I grew up. Growing up, I was the second out of three kids, living in the shadows of my eldest sibling. And competing for attention with the youngest sibling. I also find myself alone most of the time because I am a shy kid. I was also bullied a lot because I was small in stature when I was in elementary and high school years. Kids would take my snacks and my lunch because they just felt they need to. 

Fast forward 10 years later. I have been on several gigs, it didn't end up well because I just can't deal with some of the managers and bosses attitudes. 

Then here I am, living with lots of regrets and the occasional anger issues.",1
"I know that almost everyone will tell me that it’s okay to cry, it’s natural and healthy. I already know all that. The problem is, I don’t like crying in public, particularly when that public place is one of my college classes that I can’t just leave an not come back to until I’m calm enough to deal with it.
I’ve always had a bad temper. When I was little my siblings were scared of me because I would freak out and be violent. So far, the only healthy way I’ve found to cope with angry and frustration that fuels the anger is crying. But sometimes I don’t have the time to cry so hard and much that I get dehydrated and it’s not appropriate to cry in some situations. Unfortunately, in those same situations it’s not appropriate to just leave until I calm down. I’d try breathing, but the only calming breathing that makes me feel better is very heavy breathing through my nose and I’ve been told it makes me look crazy, intimates others, and is annoying.
I just don’t know what else I can do anymore. Does anyone know anything that works for them?",1
"If you are able to help, I'd like a referral to books, articles, podcasts, etc that might be especially relevant to helping with this specific issue.

I tend to plan things in my life and then ask people for actions that help me meet the goals. I easily get pretty frustrated and angry when my expectations for how they have agreed to act are not met, and my reaction really sours my relationships. Often they are small things. Some examples:
- I've asked my boyfriend to turn off the basement light when he comes upstairs and I have to turn off the light myself yet again for the thirteen millionth time
- I explained to my kid he needs to be ready to go in ten minutes, and yet he's not
- My sister said she'd take care of chopping the vegetables, yet when I come to throw them in the pot they aren't done

These kinds of things happen all the time because people aren't perfect. That means I get angry multiple times a day, and it's really impacting my quality of life and relationships. How do I learn to handle this better?",1
"OK. So i posted here the other day on my phone and poopy internet wouldn't allow me to see the rules so my bad on that.

often times when i get angry, my chest burns and i see red. my stomach turns and i feel dizzy for booting this stuff in which has gotten me the reputation of being really quiet. but i know bootling things in is no good either. been on meds for depression for a couple of months now and i usually feel really sleepy but sometimes I feel like death. main issues are uni, an ex and friends. i feel like all of them hate me. 

do you guys know any way i can combat those feelings in a more wealthy way?",1
"People are OK with slitting the throats of animals and eating their dismembered corpses. People are OK with raping animals and murdering their children so they can drink the secretions that were meant for that animal's child. Despite this, many people think I'm the weird one for eating fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. 

I've gotten to the point where I think the world is full of idiots that refuse to open their eyes. When confronted, they choose to remain ignorant even though they agree the aforementioned acts are a scourge against another living being. People can't stomach the processes by which their ""food"" gets onto their plate, yet they turn it on me when I confront them with that truth.

"Current status:  


Employed part time at a grocery store.

$3000 in savings.

Living in my parent's basement.

Bachelor's degree in CS with no CS related job history except one job dating back to 2015 that lasted a few months.

I have some freelance coding I've done in between looking for a job.

Severe Anxiety disorder.

Currently on Klonopin.

  
No license, no car. Ask my father repeatedly to help me learn to drive his car because he won't let me buy my own smaller car to take the test in, and is making me learn to drive his car to take the test. We've driven 20 minutes so far in the past 3 weeks despite me asking at least 5 times.

I don't know what to do. Getting blown off/lied to by recruiters is hurting my mental state. It's bringing me to a boiling point. My life is already toilet status. I'm trying to study for the DMV written exam and then begin studying for some A+ certifications. I'm spending all this time applying to jobs that I think I could definitely do but I'm saying or doing something that is obviously failing me at getting the job. I was just offered a job at a branch of a store farther away from me. I showed up twice at a store near me to meet with the hiring manager and they weren't there. When my interview finally came around because the branch I did well on the interview with contacted them for me, they guy that was supposed to do my interview that hires people didn't show up. I waited an hour. They had the supervisor that had his worker that kept telling me ""he'd get back to me in a few minutes"" the 3 times I called him, and finally got back to me 6 hours later, interview me. I've interviewed for telephone support for companies that constantly need more employees and considered myself overqualified, but they asked me the most dumb irrelevant technical questions that had nothing to do with the job at hand, just testing my troubleshooting abilities for things I've never done or worked on before, and decided not to hire me over that.  


I am afraid it's simply my anxiety disorder that makes me unhirable, I don't know. I'm sick of thinking. Everything is too stressful. It's always noted in my interviews that I'm nervous. Yes, I'm usually nervous the first 5 minutes of an interview but my nerves usually dissipate after that. I get closed out of positions without even rejection letters a lot of the times. I just can't do this anymore, I hate my life. I'm sick of thinking about computers. I'm sick of the things I enjoy. I want to run away from everything. Everyone I know has lied to me about some mundane shit at some point in their lives. I don't know how to trust people anymore when my own family lies to me frequently and my narcissistic mother tries to sabotage my life by telling stories about me to the rest of the family to make them all hate me.",1

"Rant incoming.

I’m really angry right now and I need to get it out. How hard is it to just support me? To listen to me? I have some mental health issues and you know what would make them better? SUPPORT. I’m sick of being invalidated, of being dismissed, of people who I thought were friends and family who are supposed to be there for me, not wanting to hear about it, getting angry with me, becoming uncomfortable if I dare show symptoms.

I cried in front of a two teachers and they were so lovely and supportive. I really liked it, but it also drove home how rare it is for me to feel that supported. Fucking hell, *anonymous strangers* are more supportive than the pathetic excuses for friends and family I have. And I bet if I kill myself, there will be an outpouring of ‘ohhhh we didn’t know she was suffering! Oh we wish she hadn’t done it! OoooohHhhHh we should have helped!’ 

I see all these people who are surrounded by loving support from their friends and family. Hell, they could sneeze and everyone would be like ‘omggggg ArE yOu OkAy?’, ‘we are allllwwwwAaayyyss here for you at this difficult time’ and ‘wow you are sooooo brave going through that sneeze all on your own!!!11!!11!!’ Whereas I message people saying I’m struggling and I get GHOSTED. I get called weak. I get told to think about people worse off than me. I get told ‘everyone has problems’.

And I absolutely hate this voice because it's the biggest douche I've ever heard. If I acted like that voice, I would be sick of myself.

How do I deal with frustration and when  the expectations that I put on myself doesn’t match with the result I get?

"Hello hello,

I am angry, that's a fact not an introduction. I grew up in an environment where my Dad's anger was out of control and destructive and I learned that anger is A-OK and a normal feeling. I'm not afraid to stand-up, speak-up or tell someone not to be a dick. Other than that I have zero depression/anxiety (apart from like the jitters before I go into a test or something, like normal stuff) but I am angry a lot of the time. I am not destructive, my anger is like a 5 minute rant and then I go play and forget about it.

I ride a motorcycle and people drive dangerously, it makes me fuckin' loose my mind that people could be so stupid and inconsiderate. They could kill someone, maybe not me but someone else. So I go home and rant at my Mum about how the world is getting out of hand and I blame T.V.

Or, I work with a total ass-hat. He would never give me grief because he knows that I would (perhaps metaphorically) make him wear his own butthole as a hat, but he makes me so angry and once again, I rant about the stupid ass because he bullies every single nice person. No one likes him and I dance when he leaves because he is so horrible to the underdogs, he pushed someone today, physically pushed them... I just can't stand people who abuse others and my brain says ""If you ain't stopping the problem, you are watching and by not doing anything about it you are like an accomplice""

I am trying to fix stuff because I am buying a house near my work so I will get to ride a bicycle to work and not have to deal with traffic (HOO-FUCKIN'-RAY!) but the other thing I can't really fix because I like my job and everyone else apart from him. I suppose I could become a witch and do a banishing spell. I don't want to hurt him but if he could magically get a much better job with more pay and we never have to see him again, that would be great.

My mother decided to say to me ""Why are you so angry? Life is too short to be angry"" but how can I just let shit roll over me like a calm breeze when I genuinely feel that people are so ignorant that they haphazardly hurt other people and still think that they have done nothing wrong? Is that really unhealthy? I'm trying to change my position in relation to the external factors but they momentarily make me defensive but I bounce back after I've had my rant. I'm a happy little person who sings all the time but other peoples behavior drives me nuts. Why won't they just go away or just be nice? Am I projecting? I don't know.

I know that the only thing we can really control is our perception of the bullshit around us but I just don't know how to and Mum thinks I need to stop having this emotion. Do I tell her that she needs to embrace her anger (to be fair she is majorly suppressed) or am I the one that has an emotional issue even though my only emotional issue seems to be ranting?

If someone could help me figure out this burning question I would be very grateful and stuff.",1
"From the title you can probably figure out the story by yourself. I got really mad during a loss in a game and I banged the desk, and that didn’t relieve my anger so I sucker punched my monitor right on the middle. When I hit it I didn’t really realize what the ending was going to be. So after I punched and all the pixels fucking went crazy I kind of stared at my monitor. This a game that I came back to every once in a while and I stopped playing because it made me mad, but when I’m actually doing well I have fun. Is there anything I should do? Buy a stress ball?

"Background: Earlier this year, I got into a relationship with a woman who I adore. I've never fallen so hard so fast before. It's like we're made for each other.

There's one sticking point though. She has a four year old son who is, to put it mildly, difficult. He's aggressive, he's defiant, he tantrums and screams constantly, including foul language he's picked up from his biological father, as well as threatening violent behaviour constantly. 


The incident: I normally manage to ignore his behaviour and keep myself out of his way when he's behaving like that. I've gotten pretty good at finding strategic moments to leave the room or go to the store so I can keep my rising frustration at his behaviour in check. That was, until this morning. From the moment we all woke up, he was on top form. Screaming, shouting, arguing, refusing to do anything he was told. He began throwing a toy at his mother and laughing in her face when he was told not to. I snapped. I grabbed the toy from him and threw it in the bin. I shouted as loudly as my lungs would allow... I hardly even knew what I was doing or saying. Then my girlfriend stepped in and clarity hit me. I've never been so ashamed or disgusted in myself and I never want to feel like this again. 

Please, what do I do? How do I keep this from ever happening again?",1
"I have tried to figure out myself out but I simply can't and I need advice. I tend to snap very often at my boyfriend. I snap over things that usually can be discussed in a normal tone of voice. I just get angry too easily. 

I blame part of this developed personality of mine on my parents who argued openly in front of my siblings and I. It reminds me of my dad picking arguments over nothing. I feel like I get angry and stressed easily just like my dad. I only express my emotions like that with people who are really close to me.. like my siblings, my parents, and my boyfriend. 

Outside of that I am seriously the nicest person ever. I get complimented for my personality and how nice I am ALL the time from my friends and co workers. But it's different when I get home to my boyfriend. I bark at my boyfriend about little things that annoy me and of course he doesn't like that. I KNOW I can be a difficult and negative person to be around. It's hard to stop getting so angry over little things.",1
"Anger works for me in a very different way, It's not a moment of peak rage in which my mind goes blank and I go beserk. It's like those peaks are spread across my days, making me feel angry all the time, always on the verge of snapping, but never out of control enough to do it. And that's kind of good: I never attacked anyone without a reason, and since I realized my constant agressiveness in conversations, I've been working to control that too, even when I'm very pissed off. 

It takes a toll though. In those moments, when I'm burning inside but I rationally know that no one around me should have to experience me unleashing my angst on them, I tend to do the exact opposite of snapping. I shut down, completely. I'll talk the least possible, I'll stop interacting with people, I'll avoid the topics that spark that anger. But as I said, I'm kind of always angry, so, especially in the last few months, this has been deeply affecting my life. I haven't been talking or seeing friends much, I keep isolating myself from people, and the worse of it all: the ""paralysis"", almost physical, it puts on me. You see, when I'm really really pissed off it seems my mind won't function (nor want to) on anything else other than being pissed off. It just won't let me focus. I can't do shit, from talking to someone to reading a text.

I'm already not a very productive person, so this hasn't been helping that. Plus the things that piss me off TONS sometimes are soooo small that I even get embarassed of talking about them with people, thus not letting me solve that problem (I'm specifically thinking about what put me in that state today, which is a dumb small jealousy of mine towards my gf). And shit, I know perfectly that the very small things that get me this angry shouldn't, but I just can't control it. 

I honestly don't know the goal of this post. Guess I just needed to vent to some people that may understand what I'm going through. I'll be very glad to hear any of your experiences, and feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk about and share anger issues too. Anyway, thanks for reading

"Let me start by saying;

I didn't think I had anger issues. 

I definitely have a short fuse but I put that down to knowing when to joke about and when to leave it and normally have a ""no bullshit"" attitude unless I'm with close friends or my girlfriend.

My girlfriend of 6 years recently told me that we should break up. Amongst other issues that I'm working on, my anger issues were brought up and she said I'm like my father. 

My father has always been quick to anger, small things will lead him to start punching and breaking objects/ walls. 

After explaining things to me, I guess she's right? I've never really been one for putting holes in walls, but I can't say I've never done it either. 

I've been working on my anger for a while. We've been together for 6 years and it was around 4 years ago that she told me about my issues and how it effects her and I've been working on it, but I guess I've lapsed and started to neglect it as I've started to neglect her. 

Whenever I shouted at her, I always felt it was justified. She had done something silly/ didn't think about what she had done and to me it was infuriating. For example, we had bought cereal and put it on the floor in the pantry where there was signs of damp and where mice could get to it and I blew up. 

Looking back now, she didn't know there was damp, and it had been a few years since we had mice. 

People messing up just gets me. It's not because I feel I'm better than everyone and they should be like me, although I do have a large ego, I can admit that, but it's because I just expect people to be and do better in general. 

In actual fact, and I don't want to blame depression, it certainly hasn't helped but I've become lazy, gained alot of weight and just given up it seems. 

My doctors aren't taking appointments for a month or so, all anger management places by me charge £20 - £50 a week for group therapy and tbh, that pisses me off. 

I've got a hell of a lot to work on, but I don't know how to work on this. I did it before, but it only got me so far and with a lack of actual medical support right now, I was hoping someone here could give me something to try?

"All in all, I am a very calm person, who rarely asks much of my close ones and don't react violently at all. But on rare occasions, when provoced, I just see red and don't care about the consequences.

I grew up in a home where people screamed a lot, anytime there was a fight - something would break, and everyone was yelling and fighting physically.

All of my life I've been prone to cause an outrage, many times I would say they were justified. Like, I would punch bullies on the schoolyard, I would scream at people being unfair etc. This has resulted in a lot of pain growing up. I would go to different counsellors and nothing has made my mood-swings better. And I've never felt understood for the rage I could let out.

In my later years (25M today) I've been a lot calmer, and better at controlling the worst of the mood-swings. I think people see me as a calm and happy sod. I now live with my girlfriend that I love a lot, and we're calm most of the time. Sometimes tho, when we get into a fight, an outrage comes, like, I want to hit something. Luckily I seem to have a barrier, cause I would never hit her, but I scream, loudly. And I destroy stuff. 

Last time this happened was 6 months ago, today it happened again. We were having an argument (which also is very rare), I hightened my voice a bit, she told me to cool off and I got madder, she provoced me by making some funny faces at me and I just snapped. I threw the blender into the kitchen wall and broke both the wall and the blender. 

I just want to have control. She gets scared, I feel that I endanger our relationship in a minute of weakness and rage. I feel ashamed, and now I have to pay alot to fix the wall and buy a new blender. All this for a minute of not having self-control.

I am set to improve myself in those moments of weakness. But I don't know where to start, there's not like I can train this behavior, since I don't want to get in a situation like this again. I want this rage to not be a defect that I let out on the person I love. Where do I start?",1
"I’ve noticed my anger affecting my relationship in a big way. I’ll be overwhelmed and all it takes is my boyfriend telling me not to forget something, or reminding me to do something for me to yell or snap at him. If he upsets me and I’m able to catch it, I’ll try to walk away but his first instinct is to grab my hand so that he can stop me and apologize, which just ends with me shoving him so that I can leave. I want to specify he’s an absolute angel and he’s never gotten physical or even raised his voice at me, but he does like to press peoples buttons and joke around and it’s SO hard to keep my cool. 

But even outside my relationship, its so exhausting to be angry all the time.",1
"I posted this as a comment on another thread, but hope more people can learn from my experiences. -----

I've never been diagnosed with ADHD, but I feel if I were actually tested as a kid I would have been, due to my girlfriend having it and us sharing many of the same symptoms. 

Recently I've been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis at age 24, essentially psoriasis so bad its seeped into my bones and muscles making me weaker and tired all the time. My body was fighting me on day to day tasks, and I literally felt like I'd have been better off dead. Felt like a burden on my loved ones, felt like complete dog shit every day. Until the meds kicked in, and really started working. I am on medicine now which is essentially a low dosage chemotherapy drug that is making me feel normalish again, but after being diagnosed I thought started having many issues with anxiety and depression which lead to anger issues. All of this stemming from the thoughts of not being in control of my own life. 

It has ignited relationship struggles, which even lead her to warning me if I didn't seek professional help, she would leave me. After stubborn procrastination, and a big blow up, and a very real argument, I did set up an appointment. This was within the past two weeks, and I have my first appointment scheduled. 

After I made that appointment, I felt better. Felt like I am making an effort to take control of myself back. Again, I haven't even gone into my first appointment yet. But I have made an effort to take in what's being said to me, changing the way I process it, and responding appropriately. 

Literally the first step is realizing there's a problem. And usually with anger comes stubbornness, which can make you think everyone else is the problem. And people telling you what to do, might upset and anger you. It did to me, until the love of my life told me she would leave me, because I was changing as a person, the anger was molding me and mishaping my personality even. Things I used to enjoy I just didn't care about anymore, or it even annoyed me.

(Refferring to the OP of the other thread on the topic of ""anger coming out of nowhere and not having a build up"") I felt the same way with the ""no build up"", but its a slow build up I've come to realise. Its the analogy of ""the straw that broke the camels back."" You build up slowly over time, not letting go of all the stupid little things that have happened, whether it be throughout the week, or even pulling things from a month or two ago. Having a fuse that is slowly being burnt away and extinguished by an apology, but then reignited by the next thing until eventually blowing up on what seems to be a small issue and it juat all come out. And the explosion makes a mess and hurts people you love, but you've already blown, and you apologizing just isn't enough. This is something I recognize, but personally honestly have a hard time dealing with, which is coping with the wrongs done to me, and realizing the difference between a real problem or me just being petty. I have been in a mind set that my time is more valuable than anyone else's. And personally I believe it stems from my medical issues. Feeling like my time is limited, feeling like one day I could wake up and everything is just going to crash down on me. But especially in a relationship, you look out for each other and lend your time when your significant other needs it. It's not being upset because you have to stop watching tv, or playing video games, or doing jack shit with your time on unimportant tasks, and taking them their lunch at work because they forgot it.

I could type and type about the problems I have, but it's almost 3am and I'm running out of steam.

I haven't really told anyone but my girlfriend these feelings. And I hope reading some of my experiences and seeing the viewpoint of someone else going through anger problems can help you in your endeavors towards finding peace again.",1
"I am so sick of living with my dad. I'm 18 and live in the bay area. It is impossible to live on my own on a minimum wage job. I am in a family of 5. Everybody including me hates my dad. I have no fucking idea why my mom didn't divorce him a long time ago, but I guess it's too late because she hasn't found a job for years and I think it's because she lost her pharmacudical license, which she probably does not tell me. So I guess our only source of living is because of my dad, according to her.

&amp;#x200B;

All the years tolerating his verbal and physical abuse towards my mom. Yes, I call out on his shit when he does something shitty, but nothing FUCKING CHANGES. There is no hope for him to change, all I must do for the next 7 years is wait patiently until I graduate college. I want him just to fucking go away and leave me alone, I don't care if he dies or moves out, as long as he's out of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only option may to move out of state, but this would be a last resort option I wish to not pursue. I don't want to have the feeling I'm abandoning my family with him if I ever move out of state. And it would take time to get my own car to even move out.

&amp;#x200B;

What the fuck am I suppose to do? Yes, if my whole family were abusive, I would leave no matter what. I want to fucking leave but I don't want to abandon my family except for my dad. How do I just go on with this shit?",1

"This has been one of the worst weeks I’ve had and I partly blame me.

Maybe I am overthinking some of this or struggling to let go. But I might as well share it here.

ABout a week ago my brother was having very bad and violent tantrum (he’s an autistic teenager that is usually calm but when he throw violent tantrums they are really violent). Instead of working together, mom and I and my other brother are fighting on how to deal with him. We tried to mend and come up with a better plan to dealing with my bro.

Later in the week I felt like we did was argue - whether it was her telling me to stop complaining that I can’t do much art, or me trying to explain I was scarfing sleep just to fix her computer and my brothers car. I mean...we still had some good laughs this week (she helped me with trying to find jobs, and I helped her by taking care of my brother for some of the week) but I’ve noticed we’ve both felt a little more irritable towards each other (more so that I am towards my father, who is also my moms abuser, ex-spouse). A family says this because a lot of the stress in life - especially coming from oyr Family and our current job situation - is what we’re taking it out on each other since we have no where else to take it out on. I’ve trued meditate and do art to help calm my anger but today some technology that came up pushed us into a brief argument at midnight. A few minutes after the argument, I feel like fucked up in I’ve reacting to a statement she made about my sleep.

But a part of me doesn’t feel like it should be normal - I just want her to be happy, and me to achieve my goals (do art, fix my sleeping problems) and be happy, and I want to one day stop feeling like I’m walking on eggshells (now that I type this up I wonder if she feels the same . 


The thing is when I’m regretful I feel a lot of calm emotions and want to do better.  But when I’m in the heat of the moment like hearing something I don’t want to hear from mom, or feel frustrated as something she can’t understand, I just get upset and stop caring about anything other than m getting back at them - Any advice?

Part of the reason why I want to find answers to this problem is that I feel it’s awkward to switch moods so quickly, and it’s all I can think about when I try to relax. The other wants me to find a way to help and support my mom in anyway I can.",1

"I cannot escape this constant urge to destroy under the slightest stressful situations. My life is being perpetually held back by this inescapable habit.

"m25. I'm an angry person if you ask me. People who know me well (family/girlfriend) would agree, but they see my up sides too. People who don't know me that well would be shocked to find out how angry of a person I can be/am. I can walk away from a newly formed friend/acquaintance knowing that we hit it off, all smiles and jokes and positive vibes. I enjoy being nice and uplifting for people, it feels good making others feel good. 

But then there's the other side of me. Some days I wake up ready to tell the world to f off. Some days I wake up totally fine, have a nice morning with my girlfriend and our dog in our little apartment, but I'll go walk the dog and come back furious because of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. It seems like I can be ""triggered"" so easily sometimes, and once I get that initial anger, it builds. ""One thing after another"".

Example, just now when driving my girlfriend to work: Walk out to car (I'm reminded that our vehicles aren't in their usual spots because someone else took the spots, no biggie, but noted) get in, and the car is messy  (long haired white dog issues) which bothers me enough seeing that I rarely drive the car and I somewhat expect her to keep it clean(ish). Find out she drove some of her family around in the messy/hairy car yesterday (now I'm embarrassed as its OUR car and it is a representation of me). So that's 3 things before I leave the parking lot. Now were driving, some ass-hat nearly merges into us so I honk, then has the gull to stare US down as he and his wife cruise past, so now its middle fingers and profanity. NOW I'm heated. As always girlfriend tries to explain how I should just move on but that's not me, but I always try. Now were getting gas, pump 1-5 are blocked, pull up to pump 7, note stating only premium gas, back up to pump 6, the #1 button isn't working, pump 8 it is! Almost to her job and taking the usual shortcut around the plaza, two semitrucks blocking the short cut. At this point I put the car in park and try to keep it together. Get her to work, the mission is complete, and the rest of my day will have a red tint over it that I wish I could avoid.

My life seems to be one disaster after the next. I relate to Michael Douglas's character in ""Falling Down"" more and more every day. I'm a freelance photographer/videographer as well as working a part time job to look good on paper to apply for a mortgage some day. We aren't financially stable but seem to somehow survive. I'm a rather intelligent person which is partially why I believe people anger me so easily. I have more stresses in life than fun. I feel SO guilty after my outbursts because my girlfriend and dog have to witness them. My dog has formed anxieties, if my voice even remotely increases, she leaves the room which adds to my pain. I love my little family I have going here but they deserve more and I strive to give it to them but seem to only fail in my eyes. It's like I live this fake life where from the outside it looks perfect and exciting, but inside its sad and mundane, is that life?

Unfortunately on top of all of this, I've been toning down my marijuana consumption to both save some money and decrease my tolerance to smoke less. Of course had I smoked before leaving the houses today, I would have brushed a lot more of what happened off of my shoulder. I hate the idea that I can only be happy or normal when suppressing my anger with marijuana.

So, as the title says... What should I do with my anger? I feel like there is something constructive I can do instead of bottling it up, or releasing it upon the poor souls who happen to be around. I have a bad shoulder so I can't go swinging pickaxes on a job site (even though I'd love to) to release frustrations AND be paid for it. 

I'm sure if I met with a therapist or whatever they'd say I'm on the same track as my father. Bipolar, depressed, all the fun stuff. The idea of being like him scares the f\*\*\* out of me. I can't afford medications and honestly don't want them. I don't want to hear that I have some condition, I want to be happy more often than not, I want to be like my girlfriend and let things slide off her shoulders, I want to stop scaring my dog and having to coax her back to me... 

I honestly forgot where I was going/what I wanted out of this post. Just feels good to type it all out really. If you read this, thank you.",1

"I want to preface this by saying I've always had a short temper, but I feel like it's gotten a lot worse over the past few years. I'm seeing a therapist, which has been helpful to a certain extent, but I still have my moments like this....

I'm at work and there was a BBQ event outside on the patio area. There's a line of people waiting to get food so I get in line and a few people get in line after me. A few minutes later this guy cuts in front of me because his buddy is there. Didn't acknowledge me in any way. Just cut in front like he had the right. I wanted to say something, but I'm at work. There were so many extremely violent thoughts going through my head that basically ended with him in suffering/dead (if Minority Report was real, I would be arrested already.)

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, it really isn't a big deal. The food wasn't even good. What kills me is how people can do shit like that. People who think they're special or that they can get away with something because they think they can. At some point, an example needs to be made because people won't change until something extreme happens and maybe not even then. Anyways, rant over.",1
"A little history about myself (m27), I always thought of myself as a pretty happy person with a good life. I volunteered in my community, had a good circle of friends, some hobbies to keep me busy, and had been clawing my way up professionally from crappy little tech user support jobs to a dream job: an engineer at a data center for a huge financial company. I started ""dream job"" first week of June. During July 4th weekend, feeling great about myself and wanting to catch up with old friends, I went out drinking with them for the first time in a while. I don't typically drink, maybe a craft beer 1 work night a week when I play video games, and on the weekend we'd have a couple beers with a fire or shooting pool, but I used to be a hard partier in college so I rationalized""what the hell,  I'm young and this aint my first rodeo -shots all around!"" that night.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where my anger issue - that I blatantly ignored or rationalized as random ""just life"" events - finally caught up to me. Without going into to much detail, I got blind drunk, blacked out, and woke up in a cell at a police station and was told I'd be getting transferred to jail. I never had any issues with police, so this was a complete and devastating shock. When I heard about what I did, including threatening friends, strangers, banging on houses, and general ""being a scene"", I was stunned and incredibly devastated. I was released, with a judge looking at me sadly saying ""Son, you have something going on and you need to address it."". My good name, gone.

&amp;#x200B;

When I went to work, I worked for a couple days but Friday was told it was my last day. Due to the close proximity to critical infrastructure at this job and that I was an at-will employee, HR recommended immediate termination despite the testimony of director &amp; managers that I doing well. My dream job and path to a future, gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Volunteering has had to take a backseat to everything. I volunteered with my local boy scout troop that I got my Eagle Scout award from, but now I know they don't really want me around anymore. The ""green team"" in my town I used to pick up trash with has told me to ""take my time and take care of myself"" before coming back. What I felt was like my contributions to bettering my town, gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Since coming back, my friends - despite saying they support me - have yet to text or call since everything went down. No ""how are you doing mans"", ""hope alls well"", ""just checking in"", etc. I haven't heard from them in what feels like an eternity but has only been two weeks. Maybe I'm overreacting, but it feels like I lost a lot of their love. Friendships, very damaged if not gone.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been so hard. I sincerely feel like I have lost everything that made me feel whole. I didn't hurt anyone, I didn't drive drunk or something, but people seeing and hearing the anger that I had inside me has pushed them all away from me. And its on me, because I feel like I've always known it was there, yet never confronted it. After all, I always thought of it as something I can handle on my own, ""it wasn't that serious"". Its been so easy to just be depressed - and even more angry - about all of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I can tell you that I have been feeling so much better because I've been confronting it, despite the setbacks. I've been seeing a therapist specializing with anger, I've admitted to my family and siblings about my anger issues and how it was all inside me looking for a way out, and I've been praying/meditating/ just sitting quietly focusing on the person I am and not what my anger wants me to be. I go to a local, open AA group where we just open up to one another about how we're feeling and its a powerful connection. I've set myself back by miles, and I can only claw myself back an inch at a time, but so long as I try to make every day a step forward I'll get there.

&amp;#x200B;

My anger wants me to be feared if not respected and always ""on the attack"". It also turns me against those I love and those that love me. It wants me to isolate myself, so it can have me ""all to itself"". But by catching the angry thoughts and the negative feedback loop it puts me in, I'm feeling that over time I'll get back to where I was. I try to exercise, walk my dog, read a bit, and make sure every day I'm getting closer to the life I had. I still need to deal with the legal consequences, but I know that whatever is coming that ultimately I am dealing with the root of the problem. Everyday has felt a bit lonely going through it, but at the same time this is a race only I can carry myself to the end of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling helpless, lonely, frightened, and upset are all natural emotions in dealing with our collective flaw. The way out of it isn't instant - and in fact its lifelong maintenance. But you can inch yourself forward everyday, no matter how small the step. And feel *good about that*. And let it embolden you for the next one.

Hope my story relates to you in a way. Love y'all.",1
"I play video games (league of legends mostly ) and I get super angry at them.mostly player vs player. I have broken about 5 keyboards 3 computer screens 3-4 mouses and I'm just done, this time I snapped my keyboard in half and just started going psycho and kept hitting myself in the head because I was mad at myself for getting angry. The worst part is that I don't know why I'm even angry in the first place. I die in a game and I try and question why I'm angry  I just can't find out why maybe it's my ego idk I just need something what should I do?

I'm done playing the game for good and will try and play more peaceful games I know the anger wasn't from the game it's coming from me so avoiding the game will only get rid of the anger for so long until something else  becauses the reason for my anger. I need to figure out what makes me angry so I can begin to try and control it.",1

"So a little backstory, I have had OCD since I was a kid but after my teenage years it’s when he got more triggered. They are a lot of things that trigger my OCD but one of them has to do with people touching me or people touching things or others that I care for. When a stranger touches me (it can a tab on the shoulder or a light poke) it just pisses me off so much that I just want to fight them, because I just think that you shouldn’t be touching people that you don’t know, I know this might sound stupid for others but for me is very serious and it messes with my emotional being. Besides OCD when I get angry I tend to tremble/shake, I start to sweat and I just cannot confront that person because what I want to do is fight or just yelled at them, so due to this I am the type of person that most of the times when I get angry Istays quiet, I don’t speak and I let my feelings build up and when I’m alone I throw things and I just regret not saying anything, but when I do speak up afterwords I feel that I was being rude and that I was maybe being exaggerated.

So today I was at work. I work with my boyfriend. Recently a new lady started working there she is around 40 years old but she doesn’t look her age, I will admit that she looks fairly young and she has a younger boyfriend. So she’s this type of person that likes to touch everything and everyone and I am not with that so knowing the way that I am I stay quiet, but today when I got to work and she just walked up to my boyfriend, held his arms and kiss it... what the fuck? I don’t mind girls saying hi to my boyfriend with a hug or with a kiss on the cheek but just holding his arm and just kissing it that was just weird and so out of place and I felt so disrespected because I was standing right there. And I know that I looked pissed off because when I’m pissed the only thing that I cannot control is my bitch face.

So my boyfriend noticed that I got mad, he too found it very weird and disrespectful that she did that to him. And then again I decided to stay quiet like always and my mind just started running and being a mess. I was shaking and feeling angry, I was sweating and I was burning up. I just kept thinking I should say something, I should speak up because if I allow this now it’s going to happening again and then how am I going to stop at if I let it slide?

So after maybe one or two hours reflecting on why I should say something, I took a deep breath trying to calm my anger down and I walked up to her and told her that what she did to make me feel comfortable and I explained that I didn’t like when people touch me and that also goes with my boyfriend. I explain to her the situation and she completely understood and she apologized, she said that she wasn’t gonna do it again. I told her that this is the place we work and I don’t want us to be awkward and after all that we ended up in a good note.

Honestly this is a big deal for me because I was a said before when I get angry I just stay quiet and let those feelings get the best of me and then at the end of the day or after weeks or years I’m just sitting down remembering that moment and regretting that I didn’t speak up. I’m just happy that I could control my anger and that I didn’t lash out and was able to calm down and talk it out even though I was shaking I managed to speak up. This is a big step for me because now I shouldn’t stay quiet whenever someone does something that I don’t like, I should just speak up and be calm about it and not lash out like sometimes I do.",1
"Tl;Dr : Looking for ways to quell anger in the heat of the moment, specifically in gaming and sports

I find it hard sometimes to control rage in the heat of the moment. The main source of this is usually video games. Normally I really enjoy them and don't have a problem besides occasional frustration that everyone gets. But when I don't play well at all for awhile, or especially when I feel I get screwed out of something in-game, I literally want to chuck my controller out the window. I used to throw controllers a lot (I'm lucky I haven't broken one) but haven't done that as much, so I suppose I've somewhat improved. But now I've taken to smacking the arm of my chair hard, causing them to basically break.

Another is during baseball practices, specifically batting practice. When I can't get a hit to save my life I feel the urge to chuck my bag against the drop-down curtain. I've had two absolute freak-outs during practice that embarrassed me a bit. My coach understands and also sees that it means I care, but I also know it's way out of line.

What are things I can do to quell these feelings in the moment? I don't want to just build up the anger but I also need to quit having temper tantrums.",1
I’ve had anger problems for as long as I can remember it’s just recently I’ve started to really notice my issues and where they originate from. I’m 25 and I have no clue how to even start to talk about what frustrates me or upsets me. I’m a “go with the flow” kind of guy and don’t like upsetting people or causing a scene so I bottle up everything. And in turn I have days where something just isn’t clicking and if my S/O asks me what my deal is even in a slightly rude tone I can feel myself about to snap. I do my best but sometimes I can’t control it. I guess what I’m asking is if anyone has tips or exercises for being able to express myself a little better so I’m not just bottling up till I explode. Thanks for reading.,1
"Firs time posting here &amp; slightly venting so sorry if it's long. &amp; Not really sure how to start. (Apologies for mobile format)

I've always had anger problems. I have a ""short fuse"" I suppose &amp; it doesn't take much to tick me off at the best of times but I'm usually good at keeping it under wraps &amp; just swallowing it down &amp; lock it away in a room but then there's so much in there &amp; it explodes - usually at the worst things. 

I don't feel like myself when I'm angry, a lot of the time it feels like a part of me I keep locked away that I disassociate myself from (like a lot of negative stuff)  gets let out &amp; DESTROYS everything around me. 

My partner started saying something like that to, referring to when I'm angry as ""she, her, angry you"" etc &amp; he isn't the first person to do that (referring to when I'm angry as a seperate person almost) which terrifies me &amp; I feel like it triggers part of my anxiety because I don't think I have split personality. But when I get angry it's like I snap &amp; switch into somebody else: I still see out of my own eyes, I can feel the words coming from my mouth, my normal thoughts are still there but then it's like a dark whisper in my ear &amp; the steering wheel that is myself is ripped away from me &amp; I just rip into whoever has set something off. 

I know my anger mostly got so much control because when I got sad/anxious it became better to flip out then let someone who hurt me see they had the power to make me cry/make sure they couldn't see me in a panic attack. 
But now when I do get out of that rage fit or sadness I can't talk &amp; I end up stonewalling whoever is trying to talk to me &amp; closing down for half an hour until my throat doesn't feel closed up &amp; I can respond with actual sentences that aren't just a few yes-no words. 

It's getting to the point where the smallest most insignificant things will set me off, &amp; it doesn't matter if it's something just like the milk getting left out or finding out the I got cheated on - I have the same rage reaction. 

Usually there's a ""scale"" of how angry I get minor things I wouldn't get over a 2, just slightly tiffed but you wave off the other person they're having a bad day/slightly bothered at yourself sorta frustration. 
But now everything feels like it's jumping up to a 8, &amp; a 10 is when I completely black out &amp; have usually lost everything because everything I suppressed is let out at once but targeted at a specific thing so usually whoever that is we don't talk anymore. I haven't been a 10 in 6+ years &amp; I never want to get back to that angry again but every time I get angry it feels harder &amp; harder to snap out. The things that used to calm me just make me feel indifferent. 

When my boyfriend &amp; I get into a argument lately he tells me I've said things &amp; some things I genuinely can't remember. I remember thinking them. I remember biting back A LOT WORSE because I know that wasn't how I actually felt I was just angry but then when I go to argue back saying I didn't I get this horrible pit in my stomach I might have. Which when I get into that same anger but it's via text I reread things I sent just to look at the screen &amp; go 'but I swear I didn't hit send. I retyped that.""

But part of me is just refusing to remember like part of me knows I went too far but doesn't want to admit I'm becoming such a fucking horrible person &amp; my control is slipping &amp; I'm terrified. 
I haven't done anything physical. The worst I get is a nervous scratch on myself it's just the emotional/mental stuff where I get toxic. 

&amp; I know it's taking it's toll on my boyfriend but I don't know where I'm supposed to start. I had tried therapy in my area but I'm too old for the free sessions now (not that they had helped much) &amp; the others are all too expensive &amp; I can't afford to take time off work to go to the sessions &amp; I don't have the internet at home to have video sessions etc. 

To make it short:
I just. I need help. My anger is so out of control it feels like I hit a switch &amp; become this horrible toxic version of myself &amp; I hate it. I'm a girl who HATES conflict with a passion, I may as well be the poster girl of fluffy sweaters &amp; having cute puppy pats &amp; ice cream. So when my anger gets out of control it feels so wrong but I can't pull myself out of it. But I need to, because it's getting too far &amp; destroying the few relationships I have around me.",1
"hi to all, 

&amp;#x200B;

is there anyone else who feels pure murderous rage when angry? like, not just a ""ugh i could hit you!"" rage but a seething, long drawn out, ""i honestly have to seclude myself before i seriously hurt others or myself"" literally anytime they're mad? idk how to fix it just hoping i'm not alone",1

"So every time me and my friends decide to meet, we go to our mutual friends house to who’s got an interest in dnd and we often have sessions of dnd together and when we’re not at our mates playing dnd we go out and play Pokemon go (don’t judge) during one session of PoGo my friend got frustrated at me for using “weak” Pokemon on a raid (I say weak with quotations because “weak” subjective but anyway back to the story) we leave unable to complete it and we hear a song playing loudly on a speaker which I pick up as “Come as you are” by nirvana, his gf also recognised it as a nirvana song and my friend, confused, asks what she’s talking about and says it isn’t nirvana it’s metallica, I then tell him he’s wrong and that it was indeed nirvana on the radio playing and this point he just tells me to fuck off and I’m left bewildered as to why. 

I ask him why and he says “I don’t want to see you” and I’m just left confused as to what I did standing in the middle of a park on my own with phone in hand, so I ring him to ask why he’s made at me because by that time he was miles away from the park we were in and he doesn’t answer, so I ring my mutual to see if he can get in touch and he refuses saying “this isn’t my concern and it’s something you two should sort out by yourselves” Which annoys me because he’s made calls on his behalf countless times but won’t do the same to me, I tell him I can’t because he won’t answer my calls and he tells me to ring him tomorrow and to consider getting professional help for my anger, basically insinuating I’m crazy. So I have no choice but to leave it and go home.

I’m at home playing games on my xb1 and he posts a bunch Pokemon he caught whilst playing PoGo into a group me, him and his gf are in and one of them he caught is particularly valuable so another member responds to him and says he would like to trade, I tell them both to be careful because a Pokemon’s stats change when they’re traded. I then get messages from his gf about how I should’ve kept it secret and another message after from my friend saying that “it’s funny I’m now bffs with this dude”.

I send him a screen capture of my dms to show him I’ve never spoken to him before and that’s where we are now. He still won’t answer my calls and another thing to mention was he had a bottle of alcohol with so I thought his judgement might have been a bit impaired.

"I’ve always had a temper ever since I knew at a very young age. I’m 16 and I can’t handle small situations, it just makes me feel agitated and I get really annoyed. I’d say my anger is moderate but can vary at points. I sometimes say “I want to kill myself” or “I’d rather be dead than alive”
The words sound unpleasant and extreme but sometimes the words just come without thinking. I feel like my family knows my triggers but use them against me cause they know what makes me angry and they still do it. I have contemplated suicide at times and have attempted self harm. Just having a pessimistic mindset doesn’t help at all when your angry. I would sometimes punch myself in the face and bang my hand into my face. It’s purely in the moment when anger arises. To release anger I have to talk to myself and vent out any emotions and maybe even cry.",1

"Hello, 

I’ve never posted on here before but here goes. Today, while I was staying with my best friend of 6 years, his indoor cat got into his backyard. I probably left the door open, I can’t remember. We tried to get him, but he fell into the yard behind the house. We go to the neighbor whose yard he fell in, that neighbor helps us out and gets him, but the cat escapes my friend’s girlfriend’s arms as she’s taking him back and climbs onto a fence divider and near to a tree. A neighbor stops by and asks if we need milk or anything to try to get him, but at this point I’m getting kind of angry—it’s been 15-20 minutes since he fell in, my friend and his girlfriend need to go to work, and I feel bad already for probably letting this cat out. 

So, I climb onto the fence, pushing him farther and farther back and he’s inching away from me, until he goes into a tree near the fence. Got him. I grab him out of the tree, lobbing angry obscenities at him “bastard, f**ker,” etc. because he’s being so much of a hassle; this must freak him out because now he’s clawing at me to get away. “Calm down or I’ll f**king kill you cat!!” I’m really not proud of writing that and it hurts to think about but that’s what I said. Now he’s ballistic, scratches up my face and arms and I’m struggling to hold onto him but he reaches up and gives me a great scratch across my jaw and I lose him; he runs off into the front yard. 

I hop the fence I was trying to take him through, practically screaming at him to “Get back here f**ker!!” (My best friend and his girlfriend looking on from the house over) and the cat runs into another neighbor’s yard and I lose sight of him. By this point, my friend and his girlfriend are leaving—“we have to go to work” etc. but it’s obvious they really just want to leave the situation and, probably, me. I walk away, starting to come down, and start to feel horrible. I get a text from my friend’s mom— “I hope you learn something from this.” I reply politely at first, then angrily, insisting that it wasn’t my fault that he got out in the first place—but she knows what happened. 

If I would’ve just taken a breath and let the cat chill on the fence by the tree until we got help, he would probably be safe right now. But I didn’t—he’s in some neighbor’s yard, we don’t know whose, possibly with dogs, or possibly uninhabited—we have no way to check, and I’m the only one here until 5. 

All in all, on the walk back to his house, I just felt sick—I couldn’t bear to even think about myself, couldn’t bear to think about listening to music, couldn’t do anything but just walk. When I got home, I texted his mom a bit more, and started to feel even more horrible as she laid out the consequences of my actions— “I forgive you, but the reality is that he may be lost forever and that will ripple through the whole family.” I’m reeling now, laying on the couch, feeling horrible, about to call my mom as I feel tears coming, but they just come to strong and I start sobbing, BAWLING, screaming into a nearby towel and flailing all about—I felt like a little child having the most horrible tantrum of his life. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me—I started looking for help on the walk home, but all I found were online anger management classes in my area. Do these work? Should i do it? Will this solve it? I just don’t know what to do—I’m still sitting here, I’ll probably just go put signs on the neighbor’s houses and hope for the best. If anyone has any insight or advice or anything, I would really appreciate it. I don’t know who to say sorry for and what—I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. 

Thanks for reading 

TLDR I lost my friend’s cat, took matters into my own hands and made things much worse by driving him into way more unknown territory and then had an emotional outburst alone after my friend left for work.",1
"I know the first step to solving any issue is to admit that you have a problem. I was hanging out with a friend and I was typing something down and he just kept staring at me. I kept telling him to stop and that it was bothering me. Next thing I know I have snapped and I am threatening to attack him with an upright vacuum cleaner. We made up, but this is serious. I need to get my anger under control before I hurt someone or something. What can you suggest that would help get this under control before it gets too bad?",1
"I just took a belt and snapped it at my father. My father gets drunk every night and comes home after work bad mouthing me and my mother. I felt so uncomfortable and fed up today and even though I know better, I threatened my father to go into his room and proceeded to snap my belt on the ground. I didn't do it psychically to him but I had to do it to assert myself. I used to hit my parents but because of time I've learned better and also because of the law. I feel like I'm a psychopath because when I was younger I took pleasure in inflicting pain on my father and till this day I still feel the urge to hurt an animal if I get too open. 

I know this is not the best way to deal with my anger but I feel like other people won't respect me and take me seriously unless I assert myself in a threatening way. Maybe I'm extremely self-conscious and have self-esteem issues but my parents should know that I'm not responsible for their relationship. I'm so quick to listen to others when they need help and give of myself, but don't take my kindness for granted. I genuinely feel alot of compassion for people but if you step my boundaries know that I will block you off.",1
I shut my friends out there is this one girl who gets it the worst i erase all of our messages delete her contact and block her number all she wants to do is help but i freak her out when she cant reach me for 5 days and she gets mad when i get mad cuz this random number is wanting to know if im alright i am probably just a little bitch,1
"I’m so tired of people taking advantage of me. I said something terrible to some guy who criticized me. I told him he was a fat middle aged fuck who deserved to blow his head off. I’ve been nice to everyone. Even when it hurt me to. I don’t give a fuck anymore. No one deserves my kindness, so ill now tell everyone off. If you say anything rude to me, I will use every bit of anger that I’ve bottled on for my whole life. Hopefully I don’t do anything I’ll regret....",1
"Not even sure where to start. This is more for me to try and get some clarification and to get my built up anger off my chest. 

So many little things these days fuel my anger. I tend to brush most things off, which usually ends up with me blowing up or overreacting at the smaller things. 

I'm 26 today, and still not sure what I want to do with my life. It bugs me to see my friends, siblings, younger people I know have a better picture with what they're doing with their life. I want to be happy for them, it just makes me feel like a piece of shit that I havent gone to college or have a decent job. My communication skills lack and my minds always clouded with negative thoughts. This causes me to drift in and out of focus when talking with people or just doing anything really. I thought about going to see the Doc, to try and get some adderall. At least use it to see if it can help get my life on track. I'm just not a fan of pills and the symptoms that can come with them.  

Currently also have a GF who says she wants to be with me, yet it doesn't feel that way most the time.  We are both deployed and have been together since we left (8 months). She's just always on her phone playing games or talking to her friends. I know she's not cheating, she does tell me when guys hit on her or when her ex tries to talk to her, so I do have that trust. We also haven't been intimate for far too long. It's not impossible on deployment to have sex, it's just she doesn't want to do anything if it involves sneaking into somewhere or bathrooms. So in that case it's pretty much a no go. I'm also part of the r/nofap community. I have been struggling giving up PMO. 6 days semi strong so far, which is right around the time I give in. Hoping this time is it. The few times my GF and I have been intimate I suffered from ED or not being able to last. She understood my frustration and said next time will be better. There hasn't been one since. All of this is also why I get so angry at myself and why I need to be successful at nofap. 

Going back to having a clouded mind, causes me to forget things easy, which stresses me out when I should remember simple things, which frustrates my GF, because now it seems like I don't listen to her. It's not on purpose, I just cant seem to focus longer than a few seconds. There's been times I've walked away in a middle of a conversation with friends because I lose interest or have lost track of the conversation. This is also part of the reason why I'm afraid to go to college. I'm afraid of failing and not being able to remember the subjects. 

I just want all this negative weight on my shoulders to be gone. I'm sick of not feeling good enough for anyone and having very little confidence in myself. I'm tired of constantly being stressed, scared and feeling like a disappointment. I want to be successful, happy and bring joy, instead of negativity to those around me.  

Thank you for reading.",1
"I woke up in a really bad mood this AM, &amp; I’ve been thinking really angry thoughts about my last job. I left it 6 months ago.

Maybe if I write it out I can get it out of my system, because I know it’s not healthy to hold onto old grudges.

When I left, none of the supervisors wished me good luck or even talked to me. I felt snubbed, because when other staff left they made a big deal &amp; gave them gifts, made sure everyone knew. Not even a private meeting or anything.

I’d been having trouble with 1 worker who harassed me for months, &amp; they did nothing about it. Another worker kept causing trouble for me, because pardon the French, she’s just a bitch.

I kept getting in trouble &amp; nobody appreciated anything I did. And the pay was very bad, &amp; I kept getting injured. I was so angry &amp; depressed, either I had to quit or I was going to end up hurting someone.

I don’t even feeling comfortable to visit the staff I like there, because there’s so many that (I interpret) don’t like me.

"I have just been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and was put on an anti depressant 20mg Lexapro.

I had a work function on this particular night and had not been warned about alcohol consumption and antidepressants. I had no idea what I was about to endure. The night started off fine with meeting and greeting work colleagues etc. I had 3-4 drinks and was feeling really blurred and not all there so I got one of my colleagues to walk me to the bathroom.

Apparently I had fallen and smashed the front of my face and back of my head really bad and had blood dipping down my face.
I was out cold. I do not remember being sick, hurting myself,  bleeding from the head or getting escorted out and put into a taxi to take me home, where I’d be safe. 

This was apparently at 9.30pm. Apparently I was sick in the taxi and became very violent when he tried to kick me out. I woke up in a jail cell. Where the police officer said I had been very violent and intoxicated. I had peed on the floor and vomited and was banging on the cell door for hours because I was in and out of consciousness. I literally thought I was either having a night mare from hell or is being held captive in an unknown where a-bouts by some fucking psychopath.

Finally at 2:30am I was discharged and on my way home absolutely frightened and a mess.

The next day I went to get up for work and fell straight on to the tiles, I had vomited all over myself. My partner had contacted my boss to inform him I was unfit to come back to work for a few days. When I finally was able to get out of bed, I looked at myself in the mirror and I had a smashed nose cuts and bruises everywhere and a black eye, my hands were swollen from punching the cell doors for hours the night before and were bright red.

I finally made it to the doctors by the second day and she had told me under no circumstances should you of been drinking on this medication and why I wasn’t informed by my previous doctor. 

When I took a beating the head due to falling I had given myself a concussion.

Work has called me and they were really great about it and are really concerned.

This is completely out of character for me and has left me feeling even more depressed and anxious, the day after the incident I have to admit I was feeling  what I would call suicidal.

I had locked my self in my bedroom for 3 days hardly ate or moved if I wasn’t sleeping I was crying, I had this sick gut wrenching feeling that takes over you and you can’t stop thinking about what has happened and if you are going to feel like this forever. 

I’m too scared to go out or drink alcohol ever again and this has really brought me down and has really scared me.

Can anyone give me advice or has anyone else been through a similar situation. How do I go back to a normal life.

All of my hard work on getting myself better had just done a 360 and I’m hating myself bad for what had happened. I just want to forget....",1
"My husband just went off on me for the third time in the last seven days. Each time I have tried to stay calm and tell him that I don't like the way he was talking to me. Sample convo: me: ""you're yelling and cussing at me and I don't like it."" Husband: ""Well then don't do xyz, and then I won't be so upset."" Me:""The way you are treating me is not my fault. I am tired of living like this."" Today husband pointed at the door and said, ""well get out then.""

I also have anger issues and it's a huge break through for me to be able to experience his anger and not match him in intensity and volume. I have worked hard on letting go of my rage and trying to identify the emotions under the anger and the triggers that seem to get me riled up. He does therapy twice a month, the max we can afford, and he claims that he is working on managing his amger with the help of his counselor.

I really am tired if going through the cycle of heightened emotions and feeling victimized- I am no victim but I continue to feel like one in light of his shouting amd cussing at me.
My support system has dwindled away in the last few years since my parents passed away and I quit going to bars all of the time. I feel like my few relatives and friends that I can turn to are just tired of hearing the same shit from me and so I don't want to annoy them with these same problems over and over. I feel like I don't have anyone to turn to when this happens anymore. There I go, being the victim again. I hate this. I am so tired of it. I feel like he cares more about being angry than about how he is triggering me (abusive childhood) or the damage he is doing. I can't just leave, and we live in a small apartment so right now I am just hiding in the bathroom and crying. 
I just want a peaceful life. I just want to have a nice quiet Sunday.



Update: seems like nobody cares but I am in a terible state right now. I wish I felt like somebody gave a fuck. He started yelling and cussing at me again, this time in front of our daughter and I lost it. Another episode. Another set back. Why is this my life.",1
"I have ASD. Whenever I get hurt by anything, I hit at it, regardless of its intentions, if it indeed as any. I worry about what I'll hit and when. My sleep quality exacerbates this, but that's another topic for another time.

"I yell all the time about things.  Not exactly very loudly but with enough volume and tone to realize I'm angry.  When I'm at work this doesn't happen and when I'm in public is almost never happens.  However when I'm at home I have the shortest temper in the world.  Usually it's over things that aren't worth getting angry and yelling about.  This morning is a good example.  I came downstairs, made a cup of coffee, and was trying to look up some eye doctors since my insurance just started.  My girlfriend comes down and politely scolds me for not doing the dishes before I started doing anything else.  This is nothing to freak out over but it pissed me off and I started getting angry and swearing at her over it.  I should have just said she was right, been calm, and taken care of it.  Yet I responded with anger.  I do this all the time over simple situations like that.

Sorry for the rant but what are some good ways to try and prevent this from happening?",1
"I hate to admit it but I do have anger issues . I get pissed off pretty easily and want to take out my anger by hitting someone or something . It’s like a desire I can’t control where I just wanna hit something . Today I got into an argument with my mother and punched 3 holes in our living room wall . At the time it felt right . But now I just regret it and hate knowing I put my mom through so much . I said things I really didn’t mean , I don’t know how to stay calm . I don’t know what’s wrong with me ... I’m a real dickhead too .",1
"Right, so I have a whole potpourri of mental health issues and for that reason I don't want to work retail anymore. So I applied for a couple factory jobs. Some employers said that me not driving was an issue and that's fine. I understand that, makes sense, since these places are far away and commutes aren't too reliable. This one dude pissed me off though because 1) he kept calling me 'honey' in a very patronizing way. I'm not a crazy feminist, alright? I'm half-Bristolian, mind. People calling strangers stuff like 'love' 'lovely' 'honey' 'sweetheart' 'sweetie' 'dear' 'dearest', the list goes on, very creative bunch, doesn't upset me in the slightest because I do it myself. It was really what he said next that made me think it was patronizing 2) he said I wasn't strong enough for the job because it was heavy work. Carrying crates around. I'm 5'5/138lbs and not fucking weak at all. I felt so angry I couldn't really say much else and left soon after. I was shaking when I stepped outside and wanted to scream and throw myself face first onto a wall (like the guy in that vine, throwing himself onto some lockers lol). I carry all the groceries in at once. I have push-started cars with dead batteries MULTIPLE TIMES on my own, one of which on slanted street with the car facing upwards. If your problem is that I lack testosterone, let me pull my medical records out to change your mind. I have a similar condition to Caster Semenya, in case you're wondering, and no, they won't fucking make me take testosterone blockers. Sadly I'm not tall like her and look a lot more androgynous with a tendency to smile a lot, which is perceived as feminine for whatever fucking reason (one of the reasons why I don't want retail atm). Sorry for ranting. My question is if I have the right to be angry at this employer and think that the remark was kind of sexist.

Edit: to say that he said that just from looking at me, not from seeing me work, in case that wasn't clear.",1
"Sometimes, I get into a phase which makes me feel so emotionless. I feel like I became a different person.
I don't feel any feelings, it's not depression or something, I just really can't feel or understand emotions that time.
I manipulate everyone, it's also much easier for me to hurt others. Because no matter how close they are to me, once they are useless or annoy me I go all out on them. I can't control my anger. 
Everyone looks pathetic, it feels so easy to do things because I'm not working by emotions like them.
It happened to me first when I was in the 6th grade, I had enough of my teacher's behavior towards my class, so I decided to write to her a long message. The day after, she told me I made her cry all night and it felt like I made an accomplishment. She then told me to apologize, I told her ""I'm sorry"", when I saw she isn't moved by that, I faked tears and apologized, she just walked away. Then I thought to myself ""how pathetic"". 
After that, I had only moments when I felt this way. I just couldn't understand emotions. Last year (I'm 17 btw), I was like that for months.
Now it comes and goes. I can have a day full of that behavior or a day I behave normally.
Normally, I'm a really sensitive person, I'm nice to everyone and care for everyone. 
When I'm emotionless, I ignore other's pain, sometimes I ask myself why is it bad to hurt others, or what's so wrong with taking other's life. It's like I'm waiting for that opportunity, but once I get back to myself, I'm so shocked and afraid by those thoughts.
It's like I have too people in my head but it's not quite like that, I really don't know what to do, I just want to stop it and return to my normal self for the rest of my life.",1
"When my anger comes out it manifests in a completely explosive way. I'll never do harm to anyone or myself physically, but I become this monster that's capable of saying the exact words you need to hear to have your heart ripped from your chest and I hate it. I don't feel like it's able to be controlled in most cases. There's just this tipping point where it feels like the demon inside me won. I don't know what to do about it. I can't afford therapy and so I guess I'm coming to the internet for some nugget of advice that may help me get through it.",1
"I’m 15 and I can’t control my anger sometimes. 

I’ve gotten into the habit over the years of bottling things up, because I want to protect people. My aunt had a mental breakdown and went to jail then a mental hospital and my mom got her foot ran over that night and I didn’t cry once. I just turn whatever I’m supposed to feel into agitation then disregard it completely over and over and over again. 

Eventually though I’ll get set off, it’s usually something minor. Lost bike seat cover, messy room, rabbit pissed on your bed and everything comes hurling out to a point where I can’t control it. 

The worst one I let my frustrations out on a rabbit, I threw him against the wall , swung him by his neck, punched him, threw him in my saxophone kit and listened as he kicked then dumped him into his food bin  and poured water in closing the lid and listing to him kick and squirm to keep his head above water. All of this is troublesome but what worries me most is that I felt relieved when I did but then this crushing regret and remorse when I put him back in his cage and watched him shiver and wheeze trying to get water out of his nose.

 I still feel like I regret it but I think how it makes me feel is still bottled up because mentally I know it should tear me and how often it’s on my mind is evidence of that yet when I recall it and think about it even once ive been crying, tears dry up and I feel empty. 

I’ve hit shoved and punched my dogs, picked my kitten up by the head half hazzardly only realizing what I’d done once they were mid air and feeling badly afterwards, carved my doors with knives and even turned to self mutilation when these outbursts occur.

 What I’ve done to my animals already is horrendous but I’m afraid if I do it to people it will get much worse. All I can think about is having a dear friend, being in a bad mood, and having them do something minor that sets me off and I punch them or kick them or slam them against a wall. I don’t want that, I don’t want to hurt anyone or anything but I can’t stop. Please, how do I stop hurting things? I don’t want to be a monster.

Edit: just happened with the kitten again. I was giving him a flea bath, he wouldn’t sit still, and i impulsively squeezed him and slammed him down in the water. I’m giving them away. I can’t give up the dogs, even if I care for them most often they aren’t exactly MY dogs they are my parents and our black cat is my sister’s. The only two I can give up are the cats. Hope someone in the area can discretely pick them up. I hate this.",1

"is it just me or when I break down in an uncontrollable anger fit, it feels like my brain and vision are fried...like I physically can feel my brain being fried and everything in my vision starts shaking and I can't see much of anything and I don't remember much of the fit because of this",1
"I've been doing a good job of using meditation and relaxation techniques to manage my anger. I don't usually take my anger out on people but I realised a while back that I have a lot of pent up rage inside, stemming from bullying and mentally abusive friendships. I hold grudges and sometimes I just can't let it go. I practice mindfulness and I use phone apps and self-help books to obtain peacefulness, but there are times I can't control how I feel. 

Today I punched a wall twice after an argument with my Dad. I'd spent 5 hours today searching for jobs which is proving very difficult. It's annoying when you're at home people think you're doing nothing all day which isn't the case with me, which of course made me really angry. After punching the wall and crying for the first time in a long time, I used my breathing techniques and calmed myself down. It's so much more effective than holding it in and crying or hurting yourself. It's been a long time since I self-harmed but arguments like the one today often gives me the urge, but today I used my techniques and now feel better. 

Just thought I'd share! What else do you guys do to control your anger?",1
"Wondering if anyone else experiences this, when someone (family or otherwise) wakes you up rudely or demands something of you unjustified so you finally have a target to destroy using facts and logic even if it's in an angry raging tone. And then afterwards realising you enjoyed it

"Whenever people tell me I'm wrong I get really really angry. It flares from 0-100 before I have time to think. It depends on how people do it of course, but usually when you've done something wrong or messed something up people yell at you. So, what do I do to stop this anger? I've been trying to meditate and that helps with some anger. I've tried looking into the source of the anger (I'm pretty sure if comes from a fear of embarrassment or letting people down), but that hasn't seemed to help so far. I can rationalize it and that helps afterwards but I still explode into an angry mess every time. I don't like this part of myself and was wondering if anyone had any tips to help me not get to that point or make it less severe that would be really helpful!

"As of late I’ve been hurting myself whenever I feel overwhelmed with anger. I destroy things, give myself bruises, and even gone as far as cutting myself. I always feel like I deserve it. However, I’m terrified  that this anger that is trapped inside me will result in me hurting someone I care about (like a potential girlfriend).

"Just a heads up i would never hurt a family member or friend of mine. 

So 2 days ago i got so angry, that i punched my table until i felt extreme pain and when i looked i saw that it was bleeding. Immediately drove to the hospital and now i need surgery for my finger.

It was because my mother kept making me angry, screaming at me and hitting my head and instead of punching her i punched the table, which is a fair imo but she still seems to be mad at me, although im the one who has a plaster on his arm. Whatever. 

It's insane how angry i get sometimes.

For example, my friends have been out 2 times on 2 different occasions and im so angry at them, because i invite them to everything whenever i do something. Nowadays i keep having the though ""fuck em all just chill by yourself until you move out and have a new and better life"" but i like these people, but they make me so angry sometimes that i want to remove them completely from my life.

Or I imagine beating them up or yelling at them in front of their victim. I don’t know if this counts as angry, but I Day dream about this from time to time, and I feel crazy kind of.

"Hi all! I am looking for some self help books that would appeal to my father.

He has openly said to me that he wants to work on his anger problems because 1) he noticed he gets very angry over things he thinks he shouldn't be and 2) he has recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure and has reached incredibly dangerous levels due to his anger. 

He asked me about a pill that would make him ""chill out"" and is looking into CBD as an option. He takes a high blood pressure medication but he says it does not help him when he is angry. I suggested therapy and he considered that it could be helpful but doesn't think he's ""that bad"" to the point where he ""needs it."" He didn't ask for a self help book, but I think if I gave it to him that he would use it and it could help him.

\-lives with wife (50), and two sons (16 &amp; 7)

I get extremely pissed and feel so bad with all of this and i dont know why. I cant eat, cant drink, cant do anything to let even a tiny bit of it out. She also says that she ""tries"" to not talk about things i find bad and it is fucking infuriating for me. Whenever im around her she never acknowledges me or my exisrance when we're in a company. For example: last time she said that she doesnt want to go out or have anything in common with drug users. She did just that and im at fault. She tells me 'dont do that, dont go out with them' etc. And she does just that several times now and she also broke a promise many times.

"Hello again. 
I’ve been spending more time alone than usual due to a breakup. At first I felt very angry but not anymore. I mostly feel pretty numb at this point to sum it up. I’ve been really trying to take this time to improve myself. I went out to get a book on anger after spending hours looking for a therapist who takes my insurance and ended up with nothing. 
It’s called “Never Get Angry Again” by David Lieberman. I am almost halfway done and it has already given me so much clarity and recommendations to help unravel why I am feeling so angry. He goes in depth to expose where the anger is coming from and how to use practices to get it under control before another outburst happens. If anyone has had a not good experience with therapists or just like reading I 10/10 recommend this book .",1

"Recently I was forced to visit a psych ward after I was threatened to be kicked out of the home. During this time:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Before the ward when I visited the hospital, my parents lied to the doctors flat out saying I was going to kill myself after we agreed on something different previously. They then told me to figure out my life myself when I told the doctor that was untrue and eventually asked them to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My mother texted multiple people including her friends about the incident. I was given visual proof but cannot reveal the giver of this info.-My aunt texted me halfway through my stay I saw when I saw my phone. Telling me a bunch of stuff about how she's dissapointed in me and that I'm the problem. I had called her about 7-10 times at different times of the day and she didn't pick up and claimed she tried calling on my first or second day but that they said ""I wasn't there"", whichever crazy/schizophrenic person picked up the phone that is.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My aunt, mother, and other aunt all conspired together to send me books anonymously on Asperger's Syndrome. My aunt's 16 year old son told me this when I saw him in person, and I figured out it was my aunt by asking an Amazon representative saying I was being harassed and that I wanted to know the first name of whoever sent the package to me.-My mother tried to hide the second book that was mailed to me as a gift  in her room becuase she knew I was returning the first one for gift card money on Amazon. She did so until I expressed concern that Amazon told me I had another book that should have arrived the day before as well, and I searched for the book and asked both my parents about it and they said it never arrived and that they didn't know about a package being sent to me. It magically appeared in my room,  after I told my father I was going to wait a few days and go file a police report at the police station saying someone was stealing our mail from our mailbox because we've had a thief or two steal from our property before and I said I was concerned about them stealing again or trying to break in.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My mother claimed to the police I threatened her when the police were called by holding a bucket over my head, the day they were called. This actually happened and was recorded about a week earlier on her cell phone, with another overhead camera in the room. She claimed she 'started recording too late' and 'forgot to turn on the other camera'. She was supposed to be my ride to work and bailed on me because there were a few items in the corner of my bed even though my room was completely clean: a game console that' s always there, my backpack, and a pair of shorts - and I had to show up late and got written up at work over it, I was forced to call an uber.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My father promised me when agreeing upon entering the psychiatric hospital that he would suggest he thought the Klonopin I was on was helping me. Now my dose has been lowered because they're afraid for my safety. It was working super well for my years of anxiety attacks. I was a shy kid and it slowly developed into severe anxiety, it runs in my family. I have two grandmothers and 3 cousins with anxiety attacks. Now I'm still shaking and randomly getting nervous on the lower dosage. I was fine and functioning like a normal human on the higher dose.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I threatened my parents with calling child protective services to report the two times they hit my brother, dragged my sister across a parking lot, and threw me up against a wall by my neck, because my father and mother wouldn't agree to go down to the police station and take back what they said about me holding a bucket over my head like I was going to hit my mother with it. I don't want acts of violence on my record. They said no so I said I was going to call, and my father said ""Fine, go ahead"". My mother then texted all her friends telling them that I told  CPS they don't feed their children and beat them regularly (That isn't what happened, and she wasn't even there for the phone call. My father was. Again, I have visual proof of all this. An anonymous informant gave me pictures of her texts)

&amp;#x200B;

\-My parents agreed before the meeting with my psychiatrist that they wouldn't mention an Asperger's diagnosis I got at 6 , which turned out to be just me being shy and having poor social skills, that another quack of a 90 year old man agreed with so he could have appointments talking to me about random shit and get paid for it twice a week. They claimed I took some kind of test to prove it. I clearly remember him telling me the test didn't matter for anything and it was for fun, so I just rushed through some written test where you circled answers and afterwards he said ""Yup, I agree with the previous doctor's opinion. He definitely has asperger's syndrome"" (I've  never needed help in school nor have I ever had trouble securing a job, doing well in school, reading body language, reading nonverbal communication, reading tone, having poor periphial vision/motor skills. ) So my parents like to tell evreyone I'm mentally challeneged while treating me like a normal person that they've kicked out on the streets when I was 18 before and stolen my money/possessions from me about 10 times.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I invited my 17 year old brother to my psych appointment as my alibi to speak on my behalf (I never got to speak to my psych with just my brother) because he sees the stuff my parents do and what I do versus what my parents claim they do and I do. He only got to speak one word. My mother didn't expect that I was bringing my brother and was freaking out. I said ""Isn't this supposed to be a family meeting? He's almost an adult and part of the family"" and I saw her texting her sisters saying ""I just want to drop jilted007 off at a homeless shelter right now.""

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

My cousin revealed personal information I DM'd to her out of confidence when asking me what was wrong after a facebook post she was concerned about, and then told our whole family. This was the same cousin that was laughing the whole time at my grandpa's funeral. I asked her not to talk to me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

  
My grandmother's daughter (my aunt) sent a group text to my mother and my grandmother of one of my facebook statuses saying ""i wish I could trust the people I loved more."" I asked my grandmother if she knew who was sharing my facebook statuses with other people and that I only had 12 friends because it was my family account. She claimed she had no idea. She was included in the group text! I couldn't believe she could lie to me so easily, but I guess she used to be a big manager at a company I won't name after being really good in sales so she was probably used to lying to her employees to cut costs and increase profits so that she'd get bigger bonuses. I'm pretty sure she even admitted she'd cut her employees hours so that she could make more money in a recent conversation to me, I can't remember exactly how she said it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at the point where I'm ready to blow, and if I get in conflict with my parents again they're just going to kick me out. So I just have to keep bowing down and eating their shit if I want a place to stay and rides to my job 10 minutes down the street until I find a job that allows me to move out. They got my medication taken away. My mom has put a great effort into trash talking me to everyone else in our family, and my father goes along with it because he's a cuck and does whatever my mom wants/agrees with whatever she says, 90-95% of the time. I already blew up at my psych via text telling her she's taking my parent's words as the holy scripture from our family meeting and that I barely got to talk, they just told her a bunch of crap and she'd ask me if I would agree with it and I'd ask my family ""Am I supposed to agree with what you said , or am I going to get kicked out if I don't, or can I talk about this privately after we talk as a group with her"" to 99% of the stuff they said.",1

It got so bad recently that I held my mom's dog in my hand and it was wriggling as if it got mad at me. My mom looked at me like I had harmed it. Even though I was holding my dog carefully and it was probably hoping to sit down, I was so tempted to just show my dog against the ground and yell it was because of my mother.  I don't know what to do anymore. What do you guys do to alleviate such anger?   
I'm unable to move out right now due to financial reasons and I just don't know how I can deal with my anger.",1
"I'm curious to see the methods people use to battle their angry side. I've found myself being a more angry person than I used to me and sometimes for bo apparent reason. I dont want to be like that and I'm consciously trying to be better at it. So my question to you is, what do you do to calm yourself when you get angry?",1
"I used to feel angry all the time during middle school. At little things and big things. I would get worked up and aggressive, but I learned how control myself when I was angry and channel it into making myself stronger and better. All I wished for during that time was be in high school where I could sports that would really allow me to take my anger out on something real. However, when I finally got to high school, I couldn't feel the anger I used to feel with the adrenaline pumping through my veins. I have no more actual drive to push myself now. I'm still determined to get better, but without anger everything feels much harder. I can still sound angry all the words and phrases are there, but I put the same amount of emotion behind them. How do I feel angry again?",1
"Sorry, this is a long one...

Hey, this is my first time posting so please let me know if this isn’t the right place. I’m a 24 year old guy, and I’ve never really considered myself as having an anger problem. Over the past year or so though, I’ve started getting angry at my partner (f22) for really irrational reasons. Like the most recent issue we had (which started in an absolutely ridiculous way) came about because I want to start feeding my cat a raw/supplement diet like I used to with my dog and she expressed concern and asked if I knew all the risk or if it was safe. I haven’t done a ton of research but I’m getting the supplements from a reliable source and I didn’t really have any concern. She said she wanted to google it and got out her phone, and for some insane reason I took that as an attack. Did she think I was a shitty cat owner? Does she think I’m an asshole? Does she think I’m stupid? All these stupid thoughts that had nothing to do with what she said AT ALL. I get that the reason I got angry is because I perceived a threat, but WHY? Why does this sort of stuff get me on the defensive and make me SO angry? I’m just not sure what to do. If anyone has any experience with this or any advice or resources I’m super open to it (which I understand is ironic because in this situation I got angry because my partner was trying to give me resources and information). I’m just sick of being angry and I’m sick of hurting her, it isn’t fair on her.

Thanks.",1
"He fucking played music until 1 in the morning, he was holding a party in his apartment. he plays his fucking tv every night till 11pm. His fucking voice sounds like white frat boy even though hes black.
He doesnt seem that big, Im 5’5 140lb myself. I think Im strong enough to beat the shit out of this fucker. I wanna land a clean hit to face and yell com’on in his douchy frat voice. Im 18 and just started working out, I gain muscle mass pretty easily. I wanna become confident enough to yell WHOS THE FUCKING BOSS in fucking black frat face.",1
Has anyone ever experienced getting angrier when they are depressed? I am nervous to reach out to anyone for therapy or help. i don’t want there to be something actually wrong with me even though it feels that way all the time. I just want to pull myself out of whatever hole i’ve dug. i ruined my relationship with my boyfriend because of insecurities &amp; mistakes i made out of anger. it’s like i can’t control myself. now i feel 10 times angrier and sadder than before. Not being able to control my anger and impulses has resulted in me being absolutely alone. i guess that’s why i’m writing here since i don’t think anyone else cares to listen to me.,1

After a good workout it feels like most of the mindless chatter is gone and it's easier to relax and focus on the meditation. I also feel it's easier to motivate to meditate and I dont have to argue with myself about getting to do it.,0
"For me it seems like the times I'm doing best is when I'm lost in something I am passionate about. It's almost a meditative state of thought. It distracts my mind from falling down negative thought loops and I develop a baseline of comfort.

Paradoxically when I think about meditating or addressing anxiety, I open myself up to negative types of thoughts. The looming and heavy burden of existential dread, and panic.",0
"Wanted to just share a video that I finally completed about everything that I learned: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmdc6Xm7LK0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmdc6Xm7LK0)

And if you don't want to watch the video here's the written part: I recently completed a 10 day meditation retreat. 

One where you are supposed to find out about yourself. Where you achieve enlightenment, where you don't speak to anyone for 10 days and you really get to know yourself. And you get to find out what really matter to you. 

But the reality is, it's a lot of you trying to focus on your breath, and the feelings in your body, but primarily you realize just how little control over your mind you have. 

You’re focusing on your breath, and then you’re thinking about how your leg hurts. Then you’re thinking about how long this session has been, then you’re wondering if everything is okay at home. And then you realize that you’ve spent the last 10 minutes not worrying about your breath and just getting pulled in whatever direction your mind wanted to go. 

This was a common occurrence during the retreat, and to be honest, one of the reasons we need to go. So that we can see how our mind works, and so we can learn about ourselves. 

Now I had heard through numerous friends that the retreat was life changing. That you’ll discover what truly matters to you. You’ll organize everything in your life. You’ll know what you need to stop doing, or do more of. What you actually care about. 

But I also heard that you shouldn’t have expectations, or you’d be outcome dependent. And you should just let the meditation teach you what you’re meant to be taught. 

So these were my expectations going in. To have no expectations. To trust the process, and to let go. 

I’ll explain what I *actually* learned in this meditation retreat, but first I’d like to tell you a little bit about the retreat so you know what to expect. 

First and foremost, there’s a lot of meditation. 

Who would have thought? There’s about 7-8 hours of meditation per day. Starting at 4:30 in the morning.  

To start the retreat, you’re expected to take 5 precepts, to maintain your Sila, which is hindi for Morality.   

Abstain from killing

Abstain from stealing 

Abstain from sexual activity 

Abstain from telling lies 

Abstain from all intoxicants

It seems easy enough, right? You aren’t talking so you can’t really tell lies. This is why noble silence is in place, because we will lie without even meaning to. 

And how often do you kill throughout the day? That’ll be no problem. But you’d be surprised how hard it is to maintain this precept when you’re lying in bed trying to sleep and there’s a mosquito flying beside your ear. 

Where your entire being wants to just slap it and end the problem for good. But now you have to delicately cup it in your hands and carry it out to the hallway. 

So those are the precepts and the whole purpose of the retreat is to acquire wisdom. The wisdom to realize that everything rises, and passes away. And that change is constant. 

But there are three types of wisdom, or panna. And not all panna is equal. Here’s a story: Say you’re starving to death and you go into a restaurant. The waiter gives you the menu and you peruse it over. The food looks so delicious, so tasty in the pictures. The descriptions are great. You have cinta - maya - panna. Wisdom gained by intellectual understanding. The menu looks good.   

While you’re waiting for food, you look around at all the happy families already eating. They all are smiling and enjoying their meals. You have suta maya panna - wisdom gained by listening to others. 

And then finally your meal comes and you get to dig in. And oh my lord is it ever good. Everyone was right. You know have bhavana maya panna - wisdom gained from direct personal experience. 

And this level of wisdom is the deepest kind. The wisdom that everything rises and passes away and that nothing is good or bad. It’s easy to understand intellectually, but we needed to go deep, and we needed to gain this understanding on our own. 

So the meditation has you sharpening your awareness, so you are able to pick up subtle sensations throughout your body and watch them rise, and pass away. 

This is something you’ll do on the meditation retreat. You spend 10 long, long days doing this. And to tell you the truth, it was the longest 10 days of my life. 

I didn’t get any of the wisdom that I was told would happen. My entire life didn’t get put into order. When i came out, i didn’t have unlimited focus for working on projects. 

But here’s what I did get: During this long 10 days, I spent a lot of time just feeling like this will last forever, that I’m never going to get out of this, and that I can’t wait to talk again or see my family again, but it felt like that would never happen. 

But when i came out of the retreat, I realized that it was actually temporary. And that everything, is temporary, and that is very freeing. It made me more capable to take risks in my life, because I now have the wisdom that everything really does rise and pass away. 

And this helped me to break down the barriers that i have in my life that are stopping me from going after what I want. I used to have fear, but now I can understand that everything is transient and even if i put myself in a nerve wracking situation, that too, like everything else, will pass. So may as well face your fears. 

The meditation retreat never taught me the things I was told it would, and I didn’t ever fully surrender and achieve enlightenment. But the benefits that i did get have resonated within me and helped in my life. I would recommend a retreat to anyone, even if it’s just to see what you’re made of. To prove to yourself that you’re capable of anything that you set your mind to. That’s the real benefit that i received from the meditation retreat. I can tell you that coming out of something as difficult as this, I definitely felt confidence that I could tackle bigger and scarier things, and felt the courage to attempt them.",0
"Every time I sit down to meditate I really don’t know what I’m expecting, right now I’m at a huge crossroads in my life and I think meditation is in order but I’ve never meditated before and want to start. I know the answer to everything isn’t just going to pop in my head but I just feel silly sitting down and meditating and then my back starts hurting and my minds all over the place I just think it would help me if I knew what exactly it was I was trying to achieve by meditating",0
"Should I be starting all of my meditations by simply focusing on what I can hear? 

What are your thoughts on meditation using the sounds around you as an anchor? Is focusing on the breath better, or is there no difference?",0
" Can you see that thinking can be used only for describing something? 

All other assertions of thinking - (Why I do not get desired results despite my best efforts? Why our relationships do not remain smooth? Why there is negativity all around? Why one is stressed? Why there is wavering while taking any decision? Why one feels angry? Why sometimes you are labeled when there is no fault of yours? And so on)-in the form of any answer give you relief from the discomfort the moment is showing. One is trapped in securing this relief. The touch of the Original is missed.

My therapist recommended I try journaling instead. I’ve tried it both online and on paper but neither have really clicked for me. I’ve been doing it on and off for so long. I don’t get any sense of relief from that either. I prefer when it’s on paper but also I don’t trust my dad to not look at it so I mostly journal online.",0

"Hi all! Thank you for your time :)

With 10 years of overthinking (as many of you I guess), which led to anxiety/panic attacks/derealization I can totally say that meditation is helping me a lot!There are a few struggles though:

* As I keep doing this I'm noticing that it's getting more and more difficult! I mean, it seems that in the first months I could keep my focus on the breath more easily. Now? I have a turbolence of intricate thoughts and as soon as I rest my attention on the breath it immediately ""morphs"" to another image. Then I notice it, label it, return to the breath and here it goes again immediately. I'm accepting them as they rise and I try not to resist them, but why are them that many now?
* During the day, when I realize I'm distracted, should I focus on just one thing (breath, activity) or should I try to experience the whole range of senses?
* As I mentioned before, I was used to experience dissociative disorders. Now I feel more grounded but it's still pretty rare for me to sense clarity and depth when I look at something or experience something. When I do, it's great, but when I don't it's like I'm watching it through a filter that evens/fogs it out. Any suggestion on how to improve the clarity moments?

Thank you so much for you patience.",0
"This has been a problem for some time, but I noticed that whenever I meditate my head begins to move involuntarily up and down. I also noticed that my arms will also move on their own if I am meditating while laying down. It's very distracting and I am curious if this is common. Does this happen to any of you and when does it stop?",0

"Emotions commonly manifest through physical sensations, if you have a sensation in your body and you associate it with an specific story, memory, emotion, trauma, etc, you will condition these feelings to the physical sensation as well.

The human body is a very complicated system that is in constant motion, change and a never ending cascade of chemical processes, most of them we don't even have control or awareness of.

If you feel something in your body, evaluate it for what it actually is, a physical sensation.
Do you get a cramp on your abdomen? or a pain in your left arm? Identify these primitive physical sensations that we are unable to control for what they truly are: primitive physical sensations that we are unable to control.

The fact that you regularly meditate has been training your brain to accomplish this task, you are already a good step ahead.

In my personal experience and during my own meditation I've noticed time and time again the truth about how my body has been keeping the score of what has emotionally happened to me in the past. I consider myself a prime example of how to handle these sensations in the worst possible way because I was adding tons of emotional context to a given physical sensation, which is no different from contaminating an open wound.

Physical sensations are not books, they don't need you to treat them as such.

Acknowled them without getting involved with them, let them be. In due time, they will stop happening.",0

"Been a mediator for few years now. In recent past I'm having very strange experience during meditation. I close my eyes and start slow but deep breathing. About 15-20 mins into meditation, (by then I'm into deep meditative state), I suddenly start to see extremely bright flash of light, right in center of eye brows. It's just a very tiny dot that randomly appears but it's so bright that I feel, as if, a nuclear missile is piercing through my forehead. It would be there for a fraction of second, but the effect it creates is so profound, that my entire body starts to shake as if I'm being electrocuted. But, it feels so blissful that words are not enough to describe the experience and I keep shivering for almost 2-3 mins in pure bliss / ecstasy. I end up crying (with joy of course) some times and after effect this experience is just amazing. Thing is, this not an isolated experience that I had. Recent past such occurrences have become quite often and very much repetitive. Initially I thought that it may have been a random experience, but as I had such experience very often, I conclude that it's definitely not random.

The characteristics of all thoughts of cravings lead to a physical sensation at the forehead, the same goes with aversion. Anybody else had this experience?",0

- Outcome : I’m more awake and nervous

I have to make a presentation 
- thought: Don’t be nervous for this presentatation

"Hi All,

Noobie here, I feel my meditation is definitely progressing but I have a couple basic questions and I apologize if these have been answered before. I've read a lot of this form about observing your thoughts without judgement. Sometimes I find myself trying not to think and focusing on my breath and I feel great but the thoughts slowly keep creeping back in. Should I just let them loose and stop trying to fight it? Also, how do you imagine yourself ""observing"" your thoughts in the 3rd person? Lastly, how important is posture verses comfort-ability. I have a leather reclining chair but I have been sitting up in it with my back straight, should I continue to do this or should I sacrifice posture for comfort?",0

"I see the word ""ruminating"" thrown around a lot in meditation discussions. It seems to usually be used in a negative way, as if it's something to avoid.

Can someone explain to me?",0
"First thing to do when your learning meditation is to not get caught up in thoughts by not contradicting why they exist and mainly not adding extra energy towards them. The basic goal is to clear your mind but it cannot be done intellectually. If I tell you to fall asleep you won't be able to do it. You have to Fall into meditation not go into meditation.

Leaving thoughts alone is not easy at the start because our mind does not work at the level of ""addition"" and ""subtraction"". It can multiply and divide something. Hense by trying to suppress or trying not to think of something only amplifies the thought you're trying to run away from.

The best tip to just observe the thoughts is to let the thoughts be just the way they are till will come and they will go by starting to not get involved with them, they won't rule your attention

Using an app like headspace will help a lot. Try doing the free 10-day Headspace Basics they explain a lot of fundamental things. If the basics are there things a lot easier.",0

"You guys, I'm in some serious trouble. I've never considered myself to be an angry or ragey individual, but competitive conditions turn me into the biggest bastard I've had the displeasure of witnessing. It's one of the greatest faults of mine that I'm embarrassed about. Throughout my life, I've always admired individuals who could keep a cool head in stressful conditions and make the best of any given situation. I've idolized these people. But I just can't seem to follow their example. Whenever things start to get rough, my body pumps me full of adrenaline and other chemicals and I just start spiraling down his metaphorical stairway of self-loathing and constantly decreasing performance. I can't handle it anymore and this part of make makes me genuinely disgusted with myself. 

Which brought me to the topic of meditation. Some really successful athletes and competitors engage in meditation and it really seems to help their performance. I'm trying to get into it as well but the online guides are not quite clear on this stuff. I just sit for at least ten minutes a day and breathe? Do I actively try to think about something? Think about nothing? How do I do this? And if I master it, will it make me zen as fuck? I want to be an immovable mountain of mental, Buddha's long lost son. Is that something I can attain via meditation? Or am I just condemned to a life of being a little stressed out bitch because of unfortunate DNA combinations?

Lately, I've been practicing meditation by observing the natural breath and then moving on to body sensations. It's come to my notice that I am sleeping early and I wake up early too. Yesterday, I slept at 10 pm and woke up at 3 am. That's 5 hours of sleep. Even the five hours of sleep that I had, was almost about the sensations I felt. The thing is, it felt different. It felt like I had no deep sleep. I'm not sure if this affects my daily behavior if it's a positive attribute of meditating or a negative one.",0

"As a psychology student and meditator, I’m wondering if there’s any scientific research on which meditation techniques are most effective. It’s not that I want to condemn any technique, but if we want to gain the benefits of meditation and certain techniques are better than others, it makes sense that we ought to use science to discover which meditation techniques are most effective. 

The techniques I would like to compare are: Transcendental, mindfullness, and vipassana. Having practiced all three, I would expect theme to rank from least effective to most effective in that order. By effective I mean purify and calm the mind. 

Are there some more techniques for us to consider? What do you think of my choice of ranking? Any ideas on scientific studies of meditation?

"I've been doing a mindfulness breathing meditation 5 days per week for about a month now. Usually for 10 minutes. However I often check my timer during the meditation when I get antsy and want to know how long I have left. It's not mindful. I also often scratch my face or my hair or reposition myself from sitting to laying to sitting again because experiencing all the sensations is so uncomfortable.

Yesterday I couldn't make it through my 15 minute sit and was very frustrated. 

Today I set a timer for 12 minutes and made it the entire time barely moving an inch. It was pretty amazing to feel the sensations arise and then disappear again. However amazing as it was it was also extraordinarily difficult and painful. 

I am very proud and it was very powerful to sit through it all, but the idea of doing 12 minutes again seems very difficult even though I just accomplished it not 5 minutes ago. 

Is it wise to reduce the time while adhering to this much more strict practice of not moving an inch, say starting at 5 mins and building up a minute each day?

Or should I just do 13 minutes tomorrow? Any thoughts?",0

"I am relatively new to mediation, and have recently transitioned from following Headspace to participating in a weekly class with a teacher, which has been mindblowing in its difference. A few weeks ago our teacher introduced us to black &amp; white breathing; during that time I began to feel a spreading warmth coming from my core (not sure how else to explain it?), which ended slowly a few minutes after we were done the meditation. Every time since, but only when doing black &amp; white breathing, I find I experience this warm, cozy feeling that starts off gradually and then increases and spreads. I've never experienced this before, but after reading the FAQs am wondering if this is just a distraction of my mind? Or is this a positive development of my meditation practice?

"I woke up this morning without struggle. Sunlight fell on my eyes, raising me from sleep and I did not fight it. I took my shower, brushed my teeth, and dressed for the day in peace and quiet. No anxieties about what today might hold or ruminations about what transpired yesterday. 

Breakfast is next on my schedule. I like bacon and eggs every morning that I have time to make it. I put on the coffee, and cook the food. Coffee smells wonderful while it is brewing, bacon sounds like morning rain, and eggs are still challenging to make the way I like. 

Breakfast is ready and I eat it outside on the back porch in the sunlight. I do not feel the need to be distracted by a book, TV show, or podcast. There is no place I would rather be than right here, right now, alive and eating. 

Time for class. Chemistry is difficult, but I am focused in lecture. What matters right now is the material, not what I got on the last exam or when my next one is. I lose myself in the beauty of science. 

Now to study. I can use this time to plan ahead, instead of stressing about it in class or at home. I plot out my future exams and due dates without too much worry.

Time for calculus. I get my quiz back and I know the grade was what I deserved. Move on to the material. A peaceful mind is a fertile garden for math. I lose myself in the beauty of math. 

Lunch time. I go home and eat a sandwich. The day is moving along now and I might read a book with lunch. Time is precious!

Time for chemistry lab. My favorite part of the school week. I arrive on time and eager, set up my lab station, and begin to work. The work goes on for three hours, but I might as well have been in there for a half hour. 

After lab I finally go home for the day. I cook dinner and with it I might watch a movie, lecture, or concert video. I've earned as much after the day. 

Before bed, I meditate. It takes some time, but the skittering trains of thought dissipate until my mind is left in quiet. 

I go to sleep with a clear head and wake up in the morning with the same.

I usually feel low after my sessions have finished but somehow feel there is some benefit, even if it's just the ability to be more honest with myself. My thoughts and ways of thinking weren't that clear to me before starting metta. 

I hope I'm on the right path and one day I'll feel lovingkindess towards myself. I also realise metta is just one piece of the puzzle to improving my relationship with myself.",0
I’ve been wanting to start meditating regularly and I’ve done mindfulness stuff before so I kinda know some stuff about it. I just did my first session with headspace and I was maybe halfway through and I felt like I was spinning. I’ve had vertigo in the past that wakes me from my sleep and makes me throw up and this was too familiar.  I tried to block it out but it got stronger and I did not want to get sick so I opened my eyes and it was gone.  So I thought it was a fluke and closed my eyes again and it instantly started again.  I just tried to ignore it again until it got intense and I needed to confirm that it wasn’t actually happening again.  Same thing happened and it stopped as soon as I opened my eyes. I have been able to lucid dream a lot and I don’t even try anymore and I’ve enjoyed lucid dreaming a lot. Could that have anything to do with this feeling with meditation.  The spinning is accompanied by lightheaded ness and I did think it was my breathing so I made sure to focus on that more and make sure it wasn’t just me hyperventilating but the sensation continued throughout the rest of the session.  The time flew by and seemed like nothing at all so I’ll be continuing but I was wondering if anyone has had similar things happen to them where the sensation doesn’t carry over when you open your eyes. If anyone knows what this might be or has advice that would be great!,0

There is no doubt about the benefits of meditation. Its scientifically proven fact. However, can you please elaborate on those idea

2) how can I feel that for only 5 minutes a day meditating, my life would change for the better. I just cannot see the correlation. Since 5 minutes is only a short part of my whole 24 hours a day cycle. So 4-5 hours later from my session, I could get angry or something.

"**Perception is a representation of reality but can never be a reality, but it exists within the realm of reality so it is a reality.**

My Friends, This may seem like a paradox. The question here is do you want to be finite or infinite? Limited or Unlimited?

Consciousness is not a perception of life;  But Perception emerges from Consciousness. By consciously dissolving the perception to become absolutely ""Dynamic"" with the life process which is everything that you can be aware of this moment will allow perception to merge with life, it will allow perception to fall into consciousness to a point where perception does not exist but just consciousness remains. Just as the fog clears and the light becomes clearer.

**""Dynamic State""** **simply means that you are able to flow with water of creation by collapsing the dams within your mind.** In reality, you're always flowing but not consciously aware due to creating **""Rigid""** perceptions that is nothing but dualistic contradiction caused by miss aligning with the dynamic flow of consciousness. One such example is thinking about the past and future tense.

By living in perceptions upon perception may seem complex but you're only limiting your own awareness to be finite. By being in the dynamic state your transcending dualism and aligning your self towards life.

Once you start becoming Dynamic by being consciously aware of life more and more things will reveal about **""Now""** / **""Present""**

**Now your perception is the same as absolute reality. Seeing things just the way they are without any false representations.**",0
"I've been picking up on some background chatter in my meditations recently. Every time I noticed them, I would realize they didn't make any sense. In my session today, I realized that I could recreate a similar chatter by just starting with any word and immediately coming up with the next words from the first thing that pops in my head, exactly like autocorrect.

Here are some examples:

""The tea leaves fall daintly from the walls corner.""

""Hypogenic states come from all pieces of time.""

""Happiness is a great undoing of society.""

Has anyone had this before? I know it's nothing to worry about it, but I'm curious how this mechanism works, from a psychological pov. I'm a very verbal thinker and I wonder if my internal speech stops making sense when I stop giving it the resources of effort and focus. In that case, it's almost like neurons firing at random, without any conscious control, which is why I get word associations that make it sound like autocorrect.",0

I need some guidance to start meditating... I'm a very mind-troubled person. I inherited a very nervous mood, way of thinking and reacting to certain situations plus I have Anxiety...I used to be a more ""joyful"" person but now I've turned bitter... I wish to return to my formal state but Life's problems and worries (mostly economic and of personal fullfiling) have me ocuppied... So that's sort of my ""profile""...

I want to try meditation but don't know where to start or things that could help getting into a relaxed state ( music , Scents(incense) or whatnot )

Any tips?",0
"Hello, I've been really into mindfulness lately, from daily meditation to therapy to reading books and it's helped so much in understanding my anxiety.

So once I got my hands on The Untethered Soul after reading so many good reviews I was very excited. But to tell you the truth, I couldnt get past the first few pages without it triggering some anxiety within me. When it started talking about the ""voice in my head"" that he believes is what can cause someone's anxiety. And how he says to say something in your head, then goes on to explain how that is not you. I began thinking ""oh great theres voices in my head"" lol and you may see where this is going lol. So now every time I meditate and I start observing my thoughts I end up getting anxious when I start ""talking to myself"", i think oh this is not me even though I'm actively thinking of the words, and it just spirals from there.

So for those who read the book, can you explain more about this voice the author is referring too. And does he mean literally anytime you think of anything in your head it is not you? 

I understand that negative thoughts and ruminating thoughts are come and go not by your choice, that I've accepted and its helped me alot. But when it comes to actively thinking and saying things ""in your head"". I begin to worry 'is that also not by my choice?' Since that ""voice"" is not me. When I'm doing math homework is it not me that is rattling off these formulas in my head?


Hopefully you understand my dilemma I'm in. I really want to continue and read the whole book but it seems everytime I try to understand the who ""voice"" thing my anxiety starts to raise and I get confused. 

Thank you guys so much in advanced for helping me out.",0

I just joined this sub minutes ago and I’m here to ask; has anyone here had mystical-type experiences while meditating? If so, what happened, were you high on anything, and what? I’ve had one mind-bending experience meditating while high on Cannabis and I want to hear some others’ experiences. This is more of a ‘story time’ thread I made just out of curiosity.

"So I am a college student, and I have been trying to meditate every day for the past month. I usually do about 10-15 min in the morning and then about 30 min to fall asleep at night. I've missed a few days, but overall I've tried to stick to my plan. I hadn't realized many changes to my overall mindset, but I was hopeful positive changes would come.

I'm currently taking a super difficult class and the first midterm exam was last week. I really really studied for it; went to all the office hours, created study guides, made flashcards of every note. At one of the professor's office hours, a few students and I were collaboratively working on solving problems. After the session finished, two of the students came up to me and wanted me to join their study group because 'you know the material better than anyone in there'. I joined their study group and was feeling like I would score pretty good on this exam. 

And today the exam results were posted and I earned a whopping 30%. 

The first thought that flashed into my mind was absolute shock and terror, but then my brain stopped and I thought about the Buddha quote 'The past is already gone, the future is not yet here. There's only one moment for you to live, and that is the present moment.' 

I think that means it's working?",0

"So there I was, sitting on the floor, about three or so minutes in to my usual session when I start feeling a little different. Usually I just do long breaths, counting to 30 and back down while checking on the rest of the body while meditating, but I decided to just go with the flow after I settled in. Next thing I know, my perception feels all weird. Best way I can describe it was it being like sliding your fov setting all the way up. It felt like my point of reference was sliding back and away from my head until my body was smaller and smaller. Little things like my stomach growling would kind of remind me I was still sat on the flood, but it was altogether weird. Anyone else have a similar experience or am I slowly going insane?",0

"Sorry if this sounds stupid.

I notice I get very calm in the latter stage of a meditation session. Its pretty noticeable as my deep breathing becomes more automatic and my heart beats slower. I was just curious as to how or why this happens? I practice mindfulness meditation using my breath as a focus point. 

Could the calmness be because of my deep slow breathing thus leading to more oxygen in my body. Or maybe because  the longer I go in a session the quieter and less frequent my thoughts become thus calming my mind, leading to a overall calmness in the rest of my body. 

This calm feeling is something I only feel when meditating. Throughout the day my heart is usually beating fast and when I become aware of my breath I'll notice it's always short shallow breathing.",0

"Hi everyone. I realize there is a growing body of scientific literature about the health benefits of meditation. However, if you search the internet you also see a lot of ""information"" about how meditation can be harmful in some individuals - as in worsening anxiety or depression. My question is, is anyone aware of any actual literature or research that shows these negative side effects? I guess I'm trying to figure out if a website promoting meditation would need to have a disclaimer about possible side effects or are these negative side effects just speculation or unstudied personal experiences without scientific backing.

For example, I believe Headspace got in trouble a while back for making claims about meditation's health benefits with aggressive marketing techniques towards the elderly and was fined by the FTC. On the other hand, most physical ""alternative/homeopathic"" health products at the store are okay to sell with un-founded health claims with ""not evaluated by the FDA"" disclaimers as long as the product doesn't cause any actual harm (FTC allows this). I guess I'm kind of edging on the legal side of things, but I'm not sure how meditation, as a product such as what headspace sells, wouldn't be allowed to have the same type of disclaimers that physical alternative health products have - but this would also depend on if meditation could possibly have negative side effects, and if those side effects have been in studies.

Anyway, back to my question: is there any actual evidence about meditation causing unwanted side effects? Thanks!",0
"Hello friends, first I would like to say I am so grateful for all of you posters in this sub. Thank you. 
I been meditating everyday (with a few oops days) for about 8 months. 20 minutes every morning using a combination of noticing breath and silent repetition of phrases that I've made up which I find to be inspiring and helpful to to me personally.
 I just finished reading Conquest of Mind by Easwaran and it was a very inspiring read to say the least and I highly recommend it.  In the book the author is quite specific about what a mantram should be and basically tells you that your mantram should be chosen from a list he gives. I'm conflicted by this as I feel I've had great results from my meditation practice in which I use my personal mantram. 
I would love to get some thoughts from others on this topic.",0

The above link is one very effective mass meditation that, if you take part in, will surely help move our planet closer to a timeline of world peace. Please give it a chance and try it out. 

Meditating certainly isn't the only way you can help to create peace. There is much that needs to happen in the physical realm as well. But a 15 minute mass meditation can't hurt! Heres some proof of the positive effects of mass meditation on the community:

And this is the updated version straight from the book:

This meditation, if done while feeling love energy, will release negativity and blockages from your chakras and open them up, thus restoring proper energy flow in your body, and improving your health. It can also change your consciousness to a higher dimensional awareness of peace, love and harmony with all life everywhere.


I highly suggest giving this meditation a try. Here is a guided audio link on YT of the merkaba meditation:




https://youtu.be/81Kf3UBQ1g8




Its from the book ""the ancient secrets of the flower of life part 2"".  The book also teaches spiritual anatomy of your 13 chakras,  healing, psychic powers, how to cast out entities/demons from your energy field, how to reconnect to mother earth,  the cosmos and your higher self,  and talks about a few intergalactic conspiracies and the current great awakening!


Here's a few pages from the book about the Lucifer experiment and how we can stop judgment and transcend this duality:

"This is my greatest fear when it comes to energetic development, and it is very common it seems in proponents of Nofap and semen retention. I don't disapprove of such activities, in fact I think they can be highly valuable, but it seems many people either through meditation and/or practising semen retention/Nofap build more energy then they are capable of dealing with, and it leaks out into way over the top creepy behavior and excessive marvelling over oneself, often with complete ignorance, gaining this sort of attitude of always being the teacher and never taking anything to heart other than themselves.

Whether you agree with me or not, I'm not really concerned, but for those of you that do, you know what I am talking about. I would like to have some physical copy of a guide or something in proximity throughout my life, so that when I read it I can get a wake up call and adjust my behaviour accordingly.

"I believe I have experienced a breakthrough which has come from through my mediation practice. 

I have always been one to get upset when I feel evenly slightly threatened. This can be by a comment of any kind, whether its intentions are benign or not. 

Recently, I have become aware that these comments that normally cause me to get upset are a result of feeling my ego attacked. Having become aware of this has allowed me to see things and hear things  for what they are without my ego. This has helped with my marriage tremendously because I now am aware of when my ego is threatened (for illogical reasons), and continue with a constructive dialogue. 

I feel as though walking through the world being aware of my ego has allowed me to be free of it. I realize all of these things that I used to do simply for my ego. The veil has been lifted.

"Hi, 

So while I was meditating, casually starting off with observing my breath and then later moving to my body sensations, I had tremendous insight into the past, which was personal.

"So I know that there are thoughts in my head as surely as writing this. And they are about the same. They are words. 

Well. When I meditated with my eyes closed when I first began meditating I found beneath these words there were images and symbols and pictures. 

And then I found beneath those images there was silence and space. 

Now, for mindfulness meditation (either sitting or walking around just living) I've found it more difficult to find space between thoughts. Yet still I often find I am mindful in a way that I am simply being. That I don't have any verbal thoughts in my mind (to watch. They just aren't there). 

BUT! I think even though I am in a space between thoughts and I am fully present, there still seems to be a landscape of feelings and impressions and not images, but ideas etc, sort of a subconscious thinking. 

I think that meditating has built a bridge between these conscious (verbal) thoughts and these unconscious (not verbal) thoughts. And actually it's kind of shitty. Because they are generally uncomfortable. 

Now it just occurred to me that I can also watch there unconscious (imagery not verbal) thoughts as I do with my conscious (verbal) thoughts. That I can step back and allow them as well. Only they are sort of nebulous. So I am not sure how that will go. Sorry. Seriously. Just stepped back to look at this unconscious landscape. 

My question is: can anyone else relate? I never hear anyone else talk about this second layer of thoughts that doesn't use words. Actually I think it's two more layers. 

Words/verbal 
Imajery/symbols
Feelings/intimations of memories

Anyway. I can't be the only one who has noticed this.

"Hello! As the title says, I think I have ruined meditation for myself. For the first part, when I try to not have expectations or try not to thing of something, I do and I cant seem to get out of the loop. I also have trouble focusing on things because when I try to focus, I bring it up as a thought in my head and it feels so forced, and I try to accept it and push it away but sometimes it even hurts my brain, and some thoughts just get forced away. I know yall are gonna be talking about how this is normal, but I dont thinkt my situation is. I think i have turned meditation into something bad, after every meditation i feel no more calm whatsoever, sometimes even worse. Back to the forcing thoughts away thing, it creates a weird feeling up in the top of my head, sometimes even induces headaches. This all came about when I started trying to be comfortable with anxiety I believe, forcing negative thoughts away. When you're told you need to accept thoughts as they come, I tend to put full focus on those thoughts, and in a way push them off without ever feeling like they are truly gone, more like I'm just putting more attention on them.
I can ramble forever and try to describe what is wrong but that would be a long post. One more thing is that I cant seem to let go of expectations.

If any of you share similar experiences or can help me I would appreciate it so much. Thank you all!",0

Anyways, based on the way we see ourselves and our beliefs about our current situation (and how we view ourselves navigating that situation)  that will determine our feeling about that situation, which in turn feeds into our self concept. In essence, creating a loop, or self fulfilling prophecy. 
Our body has a need to feel these feelings, almost like an addiction. Have you ever met people that seek out drama? Even if you're not causing problems with them, they will still find a way to get their fill of problems. Even if it means creating problems to get there. 
In addition, let's say you loved hip hop but then you went to jail. To fulfill your needs you'd probably rap or sing songs to yourself in your head. 
So, consider trying this.. especially if you're generally a depressed, angry, or anxious person. Watch your thoughts and feelings for atleast 3 days. Pay special attention to the times and places your feelings occur, and to recurring themes.

With meditation, you begin to notice this, notice your thoughts, understand what your beliefs are and understand that you choose your own beliefs, you choose your own reactions and ultimately your reality.
It's not an easy process, but I can't think of anything more fulfilling than the ability to choose your own destiny rather than letting your destiny choose you.",0
"15 minutes. I sit in a quarter lotus Position, take 3 deep breaths in. Eyes closed. I focus on the exhalation and inhalation od the breath. Then i stop doing that and notice every thought that comes. In the beginning there's a lot of them. By doing that, less and less thoughts appear. Then I quit doing that and start focusing on the breath for a few moments. Then again I go back to noticing thoughts. Is it mindfulness?",0

I just finished a 40 minutes loving kindness meditation from YouTube and I envisioned my younger self when I was 12-ish or something and I kept telling myself that everything will be fine.

"Lately I have been getting back into the habit of meditating after nearly a year without it. Something strange I have been noticing is that after a session, my phone would always act strangely. It would become very sensitive (when I scroll down YouTube it would click on random videos), autocorrect would go nuts, and an occasional time, I got called out of a deep trance and my phone would just flicker between black screen and unlocked screen, as well as that the sound was very distorted, like when you drive through a tunnel.

"A few weeks ago while I was meditating and sometbing I found really interesting happened.

I was doing one of the Headspace meditations where they have you focus on the areas where your chakras are supposed to be located. I was getting into a good rhythm with my breathing and my ears started ringing very loud. From there I followed the meditation and focused on the different areas of my body. When I did this I could feel the pitch of the ringing change with each area I would focus on.

It felt like the ringing was coming from an outside source and I was suddenly able to manipulate where it traveled in my body if I focused hard enough. It kind of felt like I was playing my body like an instrument. And when it hit each area I would hear a different sound. The lower areas having a lower tone and the higher ones having a higher tone.

Has anyone ever experienced this or have any insight on this? I haven't been able to do it since.",0

"I am finally making a concerted effort to foster and secure a routine meditation practice. I've been led enough to know that it can offer profound benefits to body and soul. I think that mine needs a good dose of clorox internally! :-) I am an Army Infantry veteran with a few combat tours as part of a reconnaissance unit. It's a rough way to go, but exciting. So there is that. In my life I have had to deal with a marriage that did not work, nearly dying three times in the space of a 7 months. 

1. July 2016: Car wreck that broke my back and gave me a traumatic brain injury

2. December 21 2016: Jumped from behind by three teens while walking my dog - took me down with a stick to the back of the head, then all 3 took turns literally, specifically stomping on my head. Giving the brain injury that I got in July a refresh, and made worse

3. March 2017: woke up by my daughter turning blue for some reason. My body for some reason decided to try out a case of nearly fatal pneumonia. Woke up in the ICU where I stayed for 5 days. 

Through all of that, my marriage that was under strain, broke. 

Now, I've had some extreme high level brain docs at a Emory U tell me that I have major depressive disorder and extreme PTSD as a result of all of the injuries. They strongly recommended meditation as a means to help control it all and get better. I have 38 years of martial arts experience, so I know the ability to focus is in here somewhere. 

But when it comes to facing up to that anxiety, the prospect of trying to mediate wins because my mind is so good at fighting back. And when I can finally sit and be mindful, all of the energy, rage, anger, confusion, make one helluva anxiety cocktail, that really comes extremely close to overwhelming me and winning back control from being free to disassociate and heal. 

I get the principle of focusing and bringing everything back to the breath. I know that I can acknowledge thoughts, and that I'm supposed to be able to recognize and release. Are there techniques that help one build a foundation to strengthen the internal resolve?

&amp;#x200B;

"I was trying to answer this question while I was experiencing a transition from competitive, career oriented material life to a more balanced, near to nature, life based on meditation and spirituality. 

Couple of months back the realisation that came across was simple. spirituality and it's meaning is timeless and eternal . The definition or an understanding on what it does to you is a everlasting. It does not change with time, context, space or person. Or even based on feelings. 

Compared to ambition or success that has different definition at different times or with different people. Ambition necessarily let's u create a flow rather than be in flow. It creates points of stress because of ever-changing desires and needs. 

So how can it coexist?  Also spirituality in essence is joy in the present moment with no thought of past or future while ambition is all about competition and thoughts of future.

""God is ever-present and unchanging.

God can be compared to the origin, infinity.

And life can be compared to the spiral, which can be seen as a folded wave.

God, oneness, and Truth are complete peace and infinite love, just as the origin is the Heart at which the wave's amplitude approaches zero and its frequency approaches infinity.""

Full text from my site:

“God is ever-present and unchanging.

Life is the phenomenal universe (maya in Indian spiritual philosophy) and perpetually and exponentially growing oneness with God. (Beings who’re more one with God than humans are, such as the Creator, beings to whom worlds are thoughtforms, solar systems like atoms, and humans like cells, goddesses and gods, angels, legendary, celestial, magical, and other supernatural beings, extraterrestrials, and spirits, exist in higher and more majestic dimensions, such as heavens. Beings who're less one with God than humans are include animals, plants, and minerals.)

This can be compared to a logarithmic (equiangular) spiral, a shape commonly found in nature.

God can be compared to the origin, infinity.

(The origin is the center point that the spiral converges towards,

ϴ → ∞ using the polar equation r = aeb(-ϴ))

And life can be compared to the spiral, which can be seen as a folded wave.

God, oneness, and Truth are complete peace and infinite love, just as the origin is the Heart at which the wave's amplitude approaches zero and its frequency approaches infinity.

(We perpetually and exponentially grow towards Godliness, oneness, and our true Self and Heart, becoming nobler \[dedicated to universal, world, and inner peace\] \[complete peace, zero amplitude\], and stronger \[infinite love, infinity frequency\], like a logarithmic spiral perpetually and exponentially approaching its origin.)”

"So, over the weekend I read a few chapters from the very popular Eckhart Tolle book, The Power of Now, which I saw being recommended here a lot. Although I was moved by the teachings, and the idea that we only ever have the present moment, I found myself a bit distraught by the heavy spiritual nature and ""purpose of awakening"". Specifically, completely letting go of the past and the future and only thinking about the future when you want to plan something. I think my ego has been hurt so much by that and I don't feel very well lol. 

I do understand that constant preoccupation with the past or the future can lead to a lot of built up anxiety in one's life, but completely letting them go seems a bit extreme to me, and very watered down- Buddhist in nature.

Life is an art. And creating the life you want to live is also an art. We live in a world whose rules are defined by capitalism, and recognizing that is just being realistic. At the same time we also live in a world where opportunities to be who you want to be are more than ever, both in terms of personal expression and career wise.

So why would you want to let go of that, and let go of your dreams for the future, as long as they are realistic? And who defines what realistic is anyways? I believe you should manifest the life that you want to live, even if that includes material things. Material things are part of the human desire.

I guess what I try to take away from this book was to appreciate the life you have right now more. As well as trusting the process of your vision. Because to truly manifest what you want in life, without getting lost in anxiety, you first need to appreciate the present life that you do have, otherwise you're going to be stuck in a cycle of not ever feeling satisfied, and chasing unattainable highs.

So, to me that means appreciating the life I live right now and finding joy and gratitude in it, because there's a lot of both to be found. And basking in it. And using that as momentum to achieve my goals. And getting up every morning and fighting for my dreams. And realizing that even my short term goals right now, are in essence my big goals. But I'm also realistic about the fact that although I do find joy and immense gratitude in being middle class, I would be much happier being rich. (Just one example)

Happiness is a journey. And I believe that designing the life you want to live is true happiness. And ego is essential in that.

What do you guys think? Did I misunderstand the book or take it too pragmatically? Am I just too young and not ready to accept true awakening? Would I have gotten more resolution had I finished it?",0

"Hi guys

For the last 2 years I have explored the topic of Life After Death and what happens to our loved ones after they die. Losing a loved one 5 years ago led me to ask questions and seek answers outside of the rational everyday approach to life.   Beyond the Veil is a documentary I've been working on that is the culmination of this research, where I’ve had the chance to meet, interview and work with some of the most incredible teachers in the field. Their work has opened my eyes to a reality I could have never even dreamed of and one which I want to share with you all.

Beyond The Veil is a feature documentary that explores life after death. Told through the eyes of those born with the gift of communicating with the spirit world, this film shines a light on the evidence and personal accounts of what really happens in the afterlife.  Backed by the latest research on consciousness, Beyond the Veil is the first of its kind film that aims to bridge the gap between the psychic and scientific world and to provide hope and proof of the afterlife.    

Now, with 80% of the filming done, I need everyone’s support to help me see this vision come to completion and tell a story that deserves to be told and most importantly help those who are grieving. For the next month I am launching a fundraising campaign to help me fund the remaining funds in order to complete this story and send it out into the world.  I would hugely appreciate any support you can give me by clicking on the link below and sharing it on your SM.

"Hey everyone,
I have been practicing meditation very on and off for the past year or two and haven’t really made much progress. Recently, I started trying to sit again and it was going well for the first week or so. 
After the first week or so, after I meditated, I would just have a constant stream of thoughts rush through my head the rest of the day. I felt almost no control over them at all and it got to the point where it adversely affected my athletic performance. This has been a major contributor as to why I keep stopping and starting my practice and becomes more and more frustrating as time goes on. 
Has anyone experienced this problem before? If so, what are some potential steps to ameliorate the situation?

"I've always loved the four noble truths of Buddhism because they're succinct, clear, and simple.

1. Existence is full of stress.

2. Stress is caused by urgency (tanha).

3. The relinquishment of urgency is the end of stress.

4. To relinquish urgency, follow this 8 step program! (The 8-fold path)

Tanha is often translated as ""desire,"" which makes people think they have to stop wanting things in order to relax or be happy. I think this is a mistake. It's also translated as ""craving,"" ""thirst,"" ""longing,"" ""greed"" or any other number of words, but these don't capture what tanha is as a concept.

The origin of suffering is not wanting things to be a certain way, or the desire to have something, it's the urgency behind a thought that causes strain. It's the difference between seeing a slice of cake after you're eaten a meal, and seeing one after you haven't eaten all day. It's the *right now* in the phrase, ""I want it *right now!*""

So, when I sit to meditate, I don't attempt to dissuade myself from wanting things. I know that my intentions are to make myself feel better, to relax, etc. and I don't have to stop wanting that. Instead, I attempt to let go of any sense of *urgency* behind my thoughts. You can do this rather simply with self talk. If you're worried about your bank account you can say, ""I don't have to check that right now, I can leave it till later."" If you're upset about a conversation you had earlier, you can say, ""I don't have to figure this out now, it can wait."" 

When you meditate, you are teaching yourself to let go of any sense of imperative behind your thoughts. ""Letting go"" doesn't mean trying to forget or push things away, because that, itself, is urgency. This is how any meditation practice can backfire and your method turns into a stressors itself. Instead, you let go by realizing you don't have to fix anything *right now*. You procrastinate your thoughts until all urgency fades, and you don't have any feelings pushing at you one way or another.

Then, practice that in daily life until you never feel a sense of urgency again.",0
"I had been meditating with positive affirmations for the past month but just over the last week I had decided to stop using them and just meditate (self guided) with some 432 hz calming music. Yesterday I had tried out a meditation method known as moon gazing and after that, everything seemed a little different

Anyways, today I mediated (self guided) for 15 minutes but this meditation stood out. My hands felt electric as if generating energy and the middle of my forehead started to tingle. 

After I finished meditation, everything seemed to appear brighter color wise. The tingling sensation is still active currently, but the most different thing I noticed is that everything (even morning coffee) began to taste very different almost a little more pure (I felt like I could taste each individual coffee bean). Then, In the shower today I was able to just appreciate the sound of the water hitting my skin and didn’t even have a single thought enter my brain really.

"This is just something I noticed, and I am writing it here as much for myself to remember as for others if they have a similar experience.  I started a mindfulness based stress reduction course a few weeks ago.  I have meditated for years but had a hiccup in recent years(you can read my post history if you really want to know). Hoping the course would help me with some mild anxiety/depression and ptsd from trauma, it was recommended by my therapist. 

This week I noticed I was much more anxious than usual.  No real reason, maybe a few more triggers than usual at work and a stressful weekend preventing me from having much downtime.  I seemed pretty run down by Thursday and noticed my anxiety was gone and replaced with a pretty strong feeling of not wanting to do anything.  Work or play.  

Seems like I can get stuck in fight or flight mode, like my sympathetic nervous system won’t shutdown when I don’t get a break somewhere.  The funny thing is I always hated the depressed feeling but it actually served a purpose.  I went to sleep earlier, I didn’t fight the feeling, so I got a few extra hours since my wife was out of town.  Seems like it resolved itself.  I try so hard to want to do something when I feel depressed.  It never occurred to me it is a natural defense to get me to do some non doing.  Force me to get back into neutral when I have been going to hard for a few days.  

Dont get me wrong, I was still watching a lot of negative cognitive distortions and working techniques I had learned in the course to reduce stress.  Doesn’t mean I think leaving someone alone and depressed is safe or a good idea.  But from a place of non judging and openness, it seemed to help.

"When living and working in four countries, I realized, that everywhere people create their own unique “I” and “me” about who they think they are. What differs is how they express it. But no matter how it always creates problems.

In Germany, people tend to be self-centered and create problems where there are none. In Japan, self-expression is very low, which suppresses the sharing of feelings and leads to frustrations. On the contrary, in the US where self-expression is very high, I often sensed that people are playing a role, leading to superficial relationships. In Mexico, the group is valued higher than the individual. I noticed that people were pleasing each other's egos instead of speaking the (unpleasant) truth, which can take a relationship to a deeper and more fulfilling level.

These observations are of course always only parts of the truth. 

Here are my learnings to overcome the ego.

"Hi, got back into meditation again recently (a week ago) and this time thinking of making it a habit and eventually a lifestyle.   


I dont know much about meditation (what different ways to do it) so for now I am just focusing on breath, which I kinda struggle to focus on anyway and it doesn't make me feel as peace as the next thing I do.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes me feel as peace (or feel good) is when I just let my thoughts wonder, and let them wonder and eventually the thought kinda shut down and I am focusing on nothing (idk, like im just there, or maybe im focusing on my head, its weird to explain) and then I start to see weak patterns (im not a visual thinker at all, for the longest time I have aphantasia), and i feel like im very light headed, and I feel like I am going deeper and deeper into state, and then (the limit of my meditation as of now) I start visualisation (again very weak) which gets me anxious or takes me by surprise and my heart starts racing and I get out of that deep state. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have very weak visualisation skills (I use to think I have aphantasia), and I was thinking that maybe my weak visualisation skills is due to trauma from childhood, or just genetics, or combination. And I had fear of being schizophrenia due to bad weed experience, and so now when I start experiencing visualization, my heart start racing a lot and I start getting anxious and it brings me out of that flow state (i have to say the visualization part happens normally when I am trying to meditate to sleep, but has maybe happened once recently).

I deal with Anxiety and Depression from CPTSD. When I really focus on the location, feeling and size of the anxiety or other difficult emotions I find some space and peace. Then many times those emotions just dissolve and I have such a more balanced day.

Just wondering what other practices folks use for dealing with trauma and difficult emotions?

"Hey! I'm a college student from Mumbai, India and I'm doing research on how mindfulness meditation can help manage stress after regular practice. Since I do not know many people who meditate regularly I thought this subreddit would be the best place to ask for help. The rationale for this research is to evaluate whether mindfulness meditation helps manage perceived stress in individuals and if it does then to promote the practice to people who are struggling with stress. 

From my own personal experience, mindfulness meditation has helped me change the way I perceive stress and my own personal identity and I hope to help other people who are in need to change how they perceive stress.

Research question - A comparative study of young and middle-aged adults on how they perceive stress before and after mindfulness meditation. 

The first part of the questionnaire is the perceived stress scale by Sheldon Cohen, which you will have to answer twice, the first time in retrospect of the time before you used to meditate and how you perceived stress back then and then the second time by answering how you perceive stress now after regular practice of mindfulness meditation. 

The second part of the questionnaire is about your practice of mindfulness meditation.

If you guys respond and I can do my research then I will post my findings along with my research paper soon so that the people who take part in the research can read what they helped create.

You can ask any questions related to my research in the comments and if you want I can also share a note which explains how I plan to carry out my research. Thank you!

"Not sure if this should be under r/IsItBullshit or this one, but I figure this is the more experienced group. 

Can you get different results from different breathing patterns?

For example, one person may suggest 4 breaths box breathing. Another might suggest 4-7-8. Then there is Wim Hof breathing, where you breathe  deeply,  then hold for a minute, or the similar DMT/Holotropic breathing.

Is this a case where you should do what works for you, or is it possible to achieve different results/effects depending on what techniques you use?",0

"After about six months of regular yoga and meditation, I feel like I’ve reduced the ‘monkey mind’ quite a bit. I’m happier, more content, more present and feel funnier in everyday conversations. I experience fewer negative thoughts or sadness. 

However, a downside to these gains seems to be a lack of desire to GROW. Maybe I’m just settling into a routine, but theoretically I still have many things I’d like to learn, including changing careers and various hobbies. I understand that desire to grow (or really any action) is driven by emotions more than practical thoughts. 

Does anyone have advice for how to maintain desires of growth and change while still maintaining feelings of contentment? They seem at odds with each other.",0

"I’m having a bit of an off day, not a bad day, just on off day. I’m trying to sit back and let my thoughts pass but after months of obsessing with my thoughts I guess I made it into a habit and it’s hard. 

I’m at thanksgiving dinner with my girlfriends family and I’m too much into my head. Questioning my OCD thoughts which are “am I suicidal” “am I ever gonna get better” “what is wrong w me”. I feel scared but at the same time I understand that this will pass. I understand that I am not my thoughts and they’re a reflection of me stressing and months of obsessing over these questions. I have seen a therapist several times, she said there is nothing wrong with me except my negative thinking. I know I’m not suicidal and I have cried about change several times. I work out 6 x a week, work at my family restaurant, meditate every day now and eat healthy. I haven’t been sleeping properly, 5-6 hours a night and I cold turkey my anxiety meds last week – they are really low dosage. 

I don’t just don’t know why I’m not getting better when I’m trying so hard. Is it because I’m looking so hard to change and get better?",0

It was carved out by the «colorful» pattern you sometimes see when closing your eyes.. like it’s all dark/black with some color spots appearing here and there... but the color spots this time turned into a nose for like 4-5 seconds. Idk what is going on, if it means something or not. It was just so random, and I was wondering if anyone else have expereineced something similar? Seeing an object or something else?",0

"About a year ago I began an experiment with my yoga nidra practice. Instead of following a traditional guided meditation, I threw on Pink Floyd's Dark of the Moon. I repeated my sankalpa three times during the opening drum beat and laid perfectly still for the album's duration, mediating on the music, and repeated my sankalpa again at the end. When I opened my eyes 42 minutes and 32 seconds later, my vision was vibrating and my body radiated that familiar nidra glow. Since then I've meditated to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Derek and the Dominos, harder albums by The Stooges and Hüsker Dü, and symphonies by Beethoven, Mozart, Philip Glass and others. I prefer full-length records, ideally concept albums -- Sgt. Pepper in particular is a blast. Pink Floyd is my go-to -- their space rock is perfect for the practice. 

I'm not sure if it provides the same alleged benefits of traditional yoga nidra, such as the supposed 15 minutes equivalent to an hour of sleep. I've discussed the matter with mediation teachers, who voiced thorough skepticism about the relaxation available from a rockin beat and screaming guitars. But I find it awesome. 

Thoughts? Has anybody else tried this?",0

I don’t want to stop the meditation to write it down or focus on the idea too much so that I’ll be more likely to remember it. Kinda seems like I’m stuck with just hoping it’ll stick.

"  

Several years ago I had established a consistent daily practice for 8 months based on Mindfulness in Plain English. Sit, watch the breath, bring my attention back when it wanders. 

Fast forward to a few months ago and I wanted to get back into practice and Sam Harris' style of teaching and meditation knowledge really resonated with me. I have been struggling to really connect with his practice and it approaches it from a perspective that I feel like I'm ""not getting"" or ""doing right"". Sit, try to locate the center or the thing called I, and turn attention on itself. He cuts right to the point of showing you how to see the self as illusion but I feel like I'm not doing it correctly. I really love the method he teaches but I'm just conflicted now. 

I want to just go back to Minduflness in plain english where I feel like I am doing it right but then I feel guilty and a bit stupid for ""giving up"" on what Sam is teaching.

I'm not sure what to do in this situation. ",0
"this last year my whole life has felt fairly boring. It started when i got depressed at the start of last college year, which i was able to deal with using meditation. 
However, i think this has definitely had a negative effect on me overall. 
I went from being a big part of a large group of friends, who i was very close with, to only being close with one person in the group and losing all ability to connect with my other friends in the group. I feel as if i have lost my witty, excitable side that i would show when around these people.
I know people say that meditation can cause a person to change, however it feels as if it has created a sense of calm in my self where i am no longer feeling emotions good or bad as much as i used to.
I was using visualisation techniques designed to ‘let go of stress’ which did create a sense of calm in me but at the cost of feeling other emotions, good or bad. 
I have been doing living kindness meditation and mindfulness recently which is helping me to realise emotions when they appear more and is creating more positive emotions in me, but it often feels theres something blocking me fully feeling certain things, such as joy and happiness which i do often feel but never in a way that makes me want to connect with others and have a laugh with them like i used to. 
Is this because i repressed my depressed and anxious feelings last year to cope with depression, which is stopping me fully feeling a whole range of emotions ? 
Things have been getting better recently now that i’m becoming more aware of how i’m feeling, but i feel there are many places where i’m being held back by not feeling certain things, e.g when socialising which has caused me to drift from many very good friends this year.
anyone have any advice on how to fully feel things again ?",0

"I've been meditating almost daily for a couple of year now. I sold, obviously. Have been relying on Headspace for quite some time, as well as some other non-guided apps and several books. 

I'm finding myself in a place where I've got an opportunity to do whatever I can I life. By that I mean that I'm at a corner in life, where I can choose a brand new path for me and for the world. My life until then felt it was on autopilot, and I feel the need to find a profound reason to act.

"Probably a year back I stopped a consistent half year meditation streak. I can remember how amazing it felt to carry that sense of calmness, stillness and the wider view on thing with me. As of now, I really want to get back into this consistent practice, but it feels to hard. I know that if I continue, I'll get back to that state where it feels like total bliss, but for now it feels to much of a chore or a full 20 minutes of wandering in distractions.

Exams will start for me now, which means I have full days of studying at home. I'll start every morning and afternoon session of studying with 15 minutes of meditation and in between pomodoro's of 25 minutes, I'll do 10 minutes of meditation. This should give me a head start.

I know I should not resist practice or difficulties within the practice and that this is a great opportunity for growth, but I just wanted to get this off my shoulders an perhaps people can share their insights with each other about this initial bump on the road.

"I guess it was just wild to me idk but I never experienced it before. I kinda forgot about my whole body beneath me and all that existed was my mind and I was in a place where I was completely not judging my thoughts (something I struggle with during meditation and daily life). I almost started to panic a little because it felt like leaving the real world behind, but I just reminded myself that I could open my eyes at anytime. But by far the most interesting part was that behind my eyelids, it was like I was watching a movie. Different colored streaks and shapes of light (idk why but the outline of a baby kept showing up). And lastly, this blue ball of glowing light kept showing up, rushing into my field of vision, staying for just a moment, and then dissipating about 5-10 times over again until the bell was rung to end the meditation. I’ve gotten to places of extreme relaxation with meditation before but never like this and I guess I don’t know what it means.

"I use to strive for happiness all the time but when you're needy about something it usually won't come until you don't want it anymore.  That's just the paradoxical nature of the universe, like when you get in a relationship and now people want to be interested in you for some reason.   Lots of people including me  get disappointed in yourself for not being happy, which is counter productive.  To make a lot more progress in your ability to concentrate, your meditation practice, and over all well-being, a much better goal to strive towards is to be aware all the time.  Being aware and staying in the moment go hand in hand.  The body's natural state is feeling good so we get in our ways most of the time. By staying aware you'll be calm and focused and in the parasympathetic state which will lead to you feeling good, no forcing it needed :)

**Tips for staying aware:**

\-Where ever you are is the most important thing in your life. We tend to be goal oriented and lose focus on the journey.  Stay aware of the path you take to get to your goal.

\-Stay aware of your feet, your feet are a great anchor to the present because it grounds you and there's always sensations there to focus on

\-Learn how to breath properly. Watching the breath is great for your health and focus. Try to breath as quietly, deeply and slowly as you can. The less you breath the better and more open your blood vessels will be so **don't over breath.**  (Unless you're exercising of course)  Over breathing/hard breathing leads to constricted blood vessels and anxiety.

\-Observe the hypnotizing nature of thoughts. When a thought pops up try and stay aware, even if you can't and you get pulled away just notice what happened and come back to the moment. Notice how your attention was snatched from you and learn from it. This will really help you get to know yourself also.

\-**Don't judge the moment,** this is what I struggle with the most, but if you can stay aware of the moment non judgmentally and observe your ego labeling things as boring or exciting you'll make great progress in loosening the ego's grip.

\-Your ego's not a bad thing as long as you're using it and it's not using you.

\-Notice all things you're aware of right now. You're awareness is the space that holds all of your senses/thoughts/feelings try and be grounded in this space.

\-Notice when you go unconscious, did you grab that glass of water with out thinking? Did you drive to work on autopilot? Did you actually say those words or did they just spill out of your mouth with no awareness?  Notice when you go unconscious and try to bring consciousness to everything you do.",0
"Pain is inevitable. Suffering is an optional extra that we experience when we cling to things and try to deny the notion that nothing is permanent.

You don't have to suffer if you can learn to properly live in the moment, and feel everything you need to feel as it comes. Don't push negative things away. Don't try to hold onto anything positive for dear life as if you depend on it. You can't control anything. Just don't resist. let it all unfold before you.

It's quite simple, really. But that doesn't mean it's easy!

Remember that through meditation, you're not trying to get yourself to permanently be in a happy and euphoric mindset or whatever. Remove the notions that it's ""bad"" to feel depressed or any other emotions we call negative. They are just as important as positive ones. Don't be upset just because you're still miserable after meditating a whole bunch. That's missing the point. It's more about becoming comfortable with your misery. Befriend your misery. Go deeper into it.",0

"Hi, I'm new here. I've recently shifted gears with my meditation practice and have become a bit of an enthusiast about buddhist psychology and philosophy in general.

I would like to do a retreat some day but I'm a little bit reluctant. Long story short, I have pretty unstable sense of self, possibly even a full-blown personality disorder, although I've never been diagnosed. I have a lot of Narcissistic and Borderline traits, more than I would like, but I've done a LOT of work and therapy and I've reached a point where I can say I have more emotional intelligence and self-awareness than half the people I meet. It's been a long road, and I haven't found what I'm looking for. Enter: meditation.

The Insight practice + Metta I have been doing has given me some surprisingly good results and I feel I've found something really worth perusing here. I'm understating it actually, I'm actually really excited about it. The more I read about it the more I want to know. The spiritual aspect of it, the opening of the heart, the increase of compassion for your fellow human-being, and of course 'the end of suffering' through enlightenment (but let's not get carried away, I don't expect to become enlightened any time soon, just a taste would be nice).

But something I read recently scared me: 'One has to be somebody before becoming nobody"". Which I interpret as 'You have have a self in order to attain 'non-self'. Makes a lot of sense doesn't it? 

Does anyone have some thoughts on this? Or even better: do people with a similar condition have some experience and advise to share with me? Success stories or work-arounds are particularly welcome :) I would really, really like to carry on doing this (at a slow and steady pace).

Thanks a lot. Loving-kindness to you all :-)",0

"Two years ago I [25/M] had severe crippling anxiety, anxiety attacks almost every day and couldn’t last a day without feeling or thinking about my anxiety. I started meditating a few months ago, nothing serious or consistent. But it helped along with working out, losing weight and seeing a therapist about my OCD thoughts and fear of having suicidal thoughts which were caused by my OCD and anxiety which was just a loop. 

Present moment, I have been following a strict workout program which I created since I have been working out for years before my anxiety. I’m currently on week 3 and have followed it to the dot, 6 days a week. I have been meditating every single day but not at a specific time and not a specific form. I have been on Insight Timer listening to a few guided meditations here and there and it’s been 11 consecutive days. I have listened to love and kindness meditation and teared up almost every time. I have been reading two self-help books here and there – Make Peace With Your Mind &amp; Can’t Hurt Me. My sleep schedule is still a mess because I’m trying to balance my last year of university and running a family owned restaurant with my dad so I’m trying my best.

Meditation has definitely helped me, but it’s also kind of overwhelming me in a sense. I’ve meditated some days where I completely lose track of time and 20 mins turns into 5 mins because I’m paying attention to my mind. I’ve done yoga nidra where I got completely lost into the sensation of every tissue. Some days my meditations aren’t working out, I’m either too sleepy to stay present or my back is sore from working out. 

I’m always trying to find the “best” guided meditation to “fix” me, but in hindsight I already know that I’m fixed. I saw my therapist last Monday and she couldn’t believe the steps I have taken on my own to become better. I’m overthinking whether “meditating” is actually working and if I’ll ever be “better”. But I already know that I’m better. When I’m able to stay present I feel peace and calmness. When I allow my mind to think it’s wondering why am I like this, is something even wrong with me, why can’t I just be me. But I then realize that my past is what made me, it is the reason why I’m like this. I didn’t have the greatest childhood – mentally. Lots of dysfunctional problems within my household which I tried to ignore by being a kid and just going out and being active but I was aware of it. Then I turned into a shut in, I spent maybe over 10+ years on the internet, avoiding actual responsibilities as school and sleeping. I did exercises and play sports but my mind was always excited to go home. But I know that I’m capable of great things when my mind is set. My entire highschool year I was getting 60s until I got to my last year and said enough is enough. Changed myself completely, mentally and physically I was at my best. Got accepted into university and from there it all fell off again and that’s how I’m here. 

I’m aware that I can do what I put my mind to. But I’m too stuck in my comfort zone. I don’t suffer from social anxiety anymore, I do have generalized anxiety but I push through it no matter what physically or chemical sensations I feel throughout my body. I’m aware it’s just anxiety. 

But now I’m confused about life. I’m not hopeless or anything. I’m actually hopeful and want to do great things. I need to work on the following things to truly feel great because they’re haunting me:

• How do I overcome my fears. 

• How do I stop feeling anxious because I’m worrying about fear. 

• How do I stop looking for my purpose in life or thinking about it constantly when I already know what I want – a great physique for my health, a well paying job so I never have to feel like I’m less, a loving family with my girlfriend.

• How do I let go of all the years I have been avoiding my anxiety and well-being and the two years where my anxiety was destroying my life

• How do I stop overthinking everything and being scared I’ll never get better 

• How do I stay present all the time and control my emotional reaction to avoid the anxious loop of OCD thoughts 

I’m fully aware that anxiety is built in us to survive as humans and that everyone has anxiety. But it’s the emotional reaction to those thoughts that can make or break you. I know that change is possible due to neuroscience and meditation studies showing that we aren’t a “fixed” mind we are a programmed mind – which is capable of being modified (change in our wifed mind). 

*Are these thoughts normal when starting to focus seriously on meditation?* I have started 30 day journey to rebirth by on Insight Timer so hopefully that will help. I’m gonna continue to work on myself through journaling, exercising, gonna start running and sleeping before midnight as well.

So I have ben spending things month working on meditashion that tetherd my phisical to my spiritual aspects. I have even had some limited success. I was wondering if anyone would like to join me on this endeavor. 
The meditashion in this case involves weving a rope or visualizing a lader that connects the higher and lower planes. And the ability to go from one to the other safely.

"I find it almost impossible to simultaneously focus on my breath without trying to control it. This creates frustration and takes me away from the practice as I'm thinking about trying to let myself breath naturally.

"So I had been hearing about all the benefits of meditation and provided I've just started my anxiety and depression meds and I'm seeing a therapist, I thought this was the best moment to try it.

I sat cross legged on the floor, set a timer to 10 minutes and played some random relaxing music video on YouTube. I closed my eyes and tried to focus on my breathing, in and out. I could feel my mind drifting away quite a lot of times, but I tried to reconduct it to the breathing without feeling frustrated about it. My meds make me quite groggy, I'll admit, and at least in one occasion, my head has fallen back, as if I were to fall asleep, but I didn't. I have heard the music and the noises around me beyond the headphones the whole time.
When the timer went off I was quite surprised because it felt like time had flown by. I thought the general sensation was the opposite! In the end, I was feeling relaxed and still groggy, I would've put myself into bed immediately, but it was the early morning.

Have I done this okay, or have I just been in a asleep/awake state for the whole time?",0

Can meditation make it easier to start studying if I do it right before I start my study sessions? Or does it only help fix the problem of ""being in default mode"" and the problem of ""being passive and reacting to things""? Do I only need to meditate in mornings/night/the day when I study, or does meditating right before studying and during study breaks help more?",0

"Hello guys,

recently I have been doing a new form of meditation that involves pronic breathing and a ""subconscious mind"" technique that I wanted to share. First, let me explain pronic breathing.

* Breathe in for 6 counts
* wait 3 counts
* Breathe out for 6 counts making an ""sssssssss"" sound
* wait 3 counts
* Breathe normally 2 times
* Repeat

Let me explain the process.

1. First, do normal get in state by meditating normally by bringing awareness to your breath &amp; body for a few minutes.
2. Second, bring your awareness to the back end of your spine and do 3 cycles of pronic breathing to establish a deep connection with your body and get out of your head.
3. Third, imagine roots coming out the soles of your feet, deep into the ground. And do 3 cycles of pronic breathing. This time, visualize the air coming up from the roots into the back of your spine as you breathe in, and out of the roots as you breathe out. This will get you grounded and make you feel safe enough to access your subconscious better. It works cause your mind can't differentiate between imagination and reality at that moment.
4. This is the important part. Start noticing sensations in your chest and stomach area. That's where repressed emotions hide. You might feel a tightness or you might start shaking. Shaking is good as it releases tension. Breathe into those sensations. Think ""When was the last time I felt this sensation?"", ""When was the first time I felt this sensation?"". Get to the core. It won't be easy at first
5. After feeling the sensations for a bit, however much you like, do 3 cycles of pronic breathing again. Imagine the sensation coming up as you breathe in. As you breathe out imagine the sensation leaving your body.
6. Sit and feel the relief for a bit

&amp;#x200B;

Try it out for a while, it works really well! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't been meditating for a while at least, but it's definitely something to try if you've already been meditating for some time.

Cheers!",0
"thanks guys already for this great subreddit, I always find very inspiring posts here. Now I got an issue since about a month. 

I've been practicing meditation for around 1 year more or less consistently ca. 10 to 20 minutes each day, sometimes 50.  Sometimes guided, sometimes only with a timer. 

I noticed something weird. The longer I don't practice meditation the more I only think and 'obsess' about it.  I kind of slipped out of my routine during my travels and since I'm back I haven't been meditating. I  get all these thoughts about meditation and they revolve around 'hm meditation is so good for you' 'yees you really felt better and were able to go through emotions' 'so interesting that meditation does that to you etc.'. 

I wondered, is that my ego trying to keep me away from actually doing meditation? I noticed it in a different area. If I tell someone ""I'm gonna work on my essay today"" I'm less likely to work on it, because the positive response of saying it out loud means in my brain apparently that I already did it. Which is not true.

Am I procrastinating meditation? Anyone had that as well?",0

"So, there's this thing that happens with me, I'll get super stressed about something and on occasion I will reach the threshold of what my mind can handle and then a second later all the stress lets go and I feel calm, but then my mind goes a bit funny in the process. I think it's some sort of pre-psychosis thing. It usually heals within a day or two and then I'm fine, but I'm wondering if anybody has a similar experience and have you tried meditating and exploring the sensations of this particular state (the state being painlessness, aloofness, loss of function, occasional extreme frustration/anger) ? I ask because my usual response to this happening is to block it all out and ignore it while it's there and just try to lay low until I return to normal. I've started meditating regularly however, and I want to explore this with meditation but I am afraid that it might aggravate the symptoms, so I'm just wondering if anybody has tried this before and what were the results?

"When you can see that thought is only an expression of what is being experienced-you begin to see that thought is not the controller of impulses and movements in your body and brain. This suddenly transforms your whole experiencing structure. Now there is no escape from what is being experienced. Thought is not able to coin any relief, consolation as an escape from what is being experienced. You enter into a new dimension.

Pick a pen. A whole set of physiological and neurological movements are involved. Now the thinking – I have picked the pen – is expression through words.  
 Thinking arises to explain. This is the limit of thinking.  
 The actual movements – physiological and neurological happen.  
 Put your hand in cold water. There is feeling in the body and brain. Now thought can express this feeling, it is not this feeling.

 The implication of this is like this.  
 When the above fact is noticed, any expression like of sadness, confusion, stress, anger and so on – there is no one questioning the feeling of sadness, confusion and so on. Thought is unable to gloss over them. Energy remains concentrated.

‘I do not want to be angry’; ‘I want to be free from fear’; ‘I want to be happy’; and so on, the words create an alienation as if there is a separate entity to reject or retain.",0

"Hey fellow 'taters, I've immersed myself significantly the more rational, westernized side of meditation for quite some time now, with the likes of Kabat-Zinn, Sam Harris, and Shinzen Young.

I'm interested to delve more into the more mystical, esoteric side of meditation. Nothing too far gone or religious, but something that brushes with ideas like ""we are all one"", and ""we are the universe experiencing itself objectively"". Something in between arcane yogic texts and scientific mindfulness speak. I am a skeptic when it comes down to it, but I really do enjoy the food for thought. Shinzen Young touches on some ideas more like this in The Science of Enlightenment, and I want to explore further. Any recommendations? Preferably something I could find on audible.

"I have been meditating on and off for the last year and a half, however in the last two months I’ve been consistently doing it every day. With the breath, is there a particular way how to inhale and exhale the most effective? Like are you supposed to let the air fill down to your stomach and then back up - I am only saying this because of the fact how I thought I was doing the correct way and getting results, however my cousin (who is a black belt in Jiu Jitsu and has been meditating since he started his martial art) has told me a different technique.

" The only real intoxicant, which lasts for lifetimes, is bliss. Nothing is more wonderful than the cocktails your bio-chemical, bio-electric endorphins released by the pineal, pituitary and other glands you were born with. No fermented beverage can match the wonderful power of life than bliss. When you can consciously awaken bliss, what need is there for temporary intoxicants?

The source of these powerful endorphins is the electro-magnetic energy your body is coming into contact with through the subtle physical body, the subtle emotional body, the fiery mental body and higher consciousness. If these bliss is lacking, the gateways must be purified first, allowing for the path to bliss to increase. It's a result of purifying negative karma, misconduct, negative habits of mind, diet and other ways which are unwholesome, which need reorientation.

When I was meditating, I was imaging myself as a kid, and trying to remind what I was feeling. I was imaging my love to people, being very happy and attached to them. During the meditation, I felt like a kid once again, I felt love, attachment and every human emotion.

I felt like I wanted to hug someone, and take care of someone. I felt like a normal human being. I know what normal people can feel now.

"As the title says; I've been meditation for almost 4 months. I decided to meditation for personal reasons.

At the start I meditated for 5 minutes, even less. Now I last between 25-30 minutes, sometimes I meditate twice a day, but most of the time I  do it just once. I think it's enough.

My method is quite simple for anyone interested:

- Half lotus (I put a pillow in my back because back issuess).
- I put my headphones and I play the Om mantra (Om mantra @ 432 hz for anyone interested).
- I just pay attention to the mantra. I bring my mind back to my meditation if its wandering.

I'm planing to try Sodarshan Chakra Kriya at some point.

Now here are some results I've had so far:

- As I said: I meditate more and more as time pass by. I feel that I could meditate for one hour in a few months (i do it everyday).

- Itching: I think this is a common issue for almost everyone. I've read threads on this sub asking for advice and how to get over it. This is what happened to me:

I had terrible itching (I still have), the itching in my ears were a pain in the ass to deal with, I had to stop my meditation because the itching was unbearable. Anyways, at some point I said 'fuck it, ill meditate for 5 mins if necessary. better than nothing.' I was frustrated and I thought I would never meditate more than 10 mins or so. 

However, out of the blue, a couple of months ago (maybe august?) I could tolerate the itch.  I can't explain, but now the itch doesn't bother me. At all. Even if it is intense. Probably my will became stronger?. I don't know, however this is a great progress. 

- I can focus more easily. I still have a very active mind, but because I choose to, but  now i can control it whenever I want.
 
I remember that my mind was a mess in the mornings, it wouldn't shut up, but now is quite different.

- This is where I need help and know why it happened:

Last sunday I started to meditate in the afternoon; at some point of my meditation I began to see images, not abstract images or random stuff but it was more like places I know in real life, i know they exist  because those images were from my city. Does it make sense?.

It just happened me once, but it was the weirdest experience i've had so far. I mean, I  sometimes I see some lights, but I never experienced something  like that. It happned me once, but never again. Has anyone else experienced something like that?.

"I have been trying to control the ability to manifest for something but it does not work when I want it to work. I can only manifest something only when I am really nervous, panicking or in difficult situation. Like for example when I am really nervous because I have a problem then I use my inner brain to want something and the problem fixes, most of the times it's instantly. For example, the other day I was looking for something really important that I lost and needed, I could not find it so I gave up and I was really nervous and panicking then suddenly I would find it. One day a tree fell on my face, I was really panicking and my power to manifest was insanely strong. This happens like many times in many moments in my life, but since I started meditating I get a lot less nervous so I cannot use this ability as often.

How do I control this ability to manifest whenever I want and not only when  I am nervous, panicking or in difficult situation?",0
"When I was a kid, I would find myself while walking around,  and whenever I kind of ""felt"" like it, I could stare at an object and create this feeling of falling or butterflies in my stomach.

Today, as a grown middle aged man, I can still do this, although it's doesn't come as easy and I don't get the bizarre feeling of being surprised I'm ""here"".  

I can recreate this falling feeling especially when meditating or if I'm just walking around and stare at something intently enough.  

I've never heard of anybody else being able to do this.  I never thought to ask either.  Anybody?

"I've been meditating consistently once a day since 2012. The other night I was at a concert and my friend kept talking to me during a quiet song. A girl behind us rudely interrupted and said ""STOP TALKING"". Mind you, she was technically right--we shouldn't have been talking in that moment, but the way she did it was super abrasive and abrupt. 

What ensued was something I have not experienced before, and although it seems simple, it was actually pretty remarkable: I intuitively watched my emotional reaction to the occurrence. I observed the anger pulse through my chest and out to the rest of my body, and acknowledged that I was observing. I remained conscious, and didn't react to her in any way.

It might seem somewhat mundane, but these moments are crucial. It has always been an intellectual battle first and foremost to tell myself to be present. This came naturally and without much effort. The bottom line is it's easy to do your practice at home and get behind the routine, but it's in the ""real world"" where the practice becomes concrete. These are the little victories which signify that the practice is making you more conscious and aware.",0
"Just wanted to share my recent experience. I’ve been mediating for 30 minutes every morning for almost a year now. I listen to Sam Harris guided meditations. And recently I had a very blissful experience. At one point in my guided mediation (Sam Harris waking up app) Sam instructs you to focus on the darkness on the back of your eyelids. At first , I’ve always had trouble focusing, my thoughts would intervene and I’d be swept away and unable to focus on the task at hand. With more time I was able to fully focus on my visual field, everything became more spacious, I felt like I was zapped into the present for once in my life. The darkness turned into burst of light and color and my body broke into feeling of euphoria. I literally cried and was taken over by a deep sense of peace. Can anyone explain what happened to me ?",0
"So I've been trying to meditate since a month now...I started it using headspace and it went pretty good.. later I decided that I'll meditate without any app or music kinda...so I'm trying this from like past 2 weeks...but whenever I meditate..I get negative thoughts... paranormal thoughts...I just keep opening my eyes and I just look around hoping nobody is around me...idk I'm just scared to mediate... especially without any music or app...it gets a lot easier with them like it doesn't feel alone... without those stuff I barely meditate for 2 minutes max then I keep on opening my eyes no matter what + my head kind of vibrates like weirdly idk I'm new to this stuff and the vibration increases as I the minutes pass during meditation...+ How do u control itching while meditating? Like I never really get an urge to itch but during mediation it's like every other moment...thanks for reading , any help would be appreciated as I really want to meditate :)",0

"Hi, I have recently started meditation but know nothing about it. I have done some casual research as to how it works and most common practices and different types yogic breathing patterns. I feel meditation is now a clusterfuck of different methods in my head and I have no clear understanding(completion) of it. My process is simple 

1. I first try to hear out everything I can , expanding my range 
2. until finally I start drowning them all out, focusing just on my breathing 
3. I then begin to focus on the spot between my eyebrows without looking at that spot with my eyes (I read this somewhere and I have no idea why , I guess something to do with third eye)

I try to keep this up for as long as possible. I have not been perfect, I fail to be consistent , my mind might wander suddenly onto some thought but I am quickly back onto focusing on my breathing.  As I was doing this today, I had only felt like 7 mins had passed or maximum ten minutes no more , but when I opened my eyes it had been 40 minutes.

I would like to know from any of the internet experts over here if my processs is in anyway useful? or right?.

This time skip I have read about in advanced practitioners and I am sure I am not one , is it as a result of some mistake in my process.

(I sit up straight and legs crossed with my arms placed comfortably during meditation)",0
"Hi everyone, I’m new to meditation and today was my first actual mediation that was guided and with a group of people. At one point I felt like something was pulling me by the back of my neck and trying to pull me up and away? But at the same time I felt like something was pushing my chest back and against my chair almost to like stop the pulling from the top? It was weird... I felt like I was being torn between two different energies wanting me to go two different ways I suppose? Is this normal?",0
"Ive had a weird experience plently of times most occuring when i meditate. I get an energy rush usually starting from my spine that engulfs my whole body like a wave of blissful subtle numbness.  Depending on how clear my mind is, it will either just go to my head and create this euphoric feeling (it makes my whole face feel a little tight), or if im really calm, it curcuits throughout my whole body, going down to my toes. If my mind stays empty, I can achieve multiple bursts of these euphoric pulses go through my body. The feeling is best represented by when you get goosebumps by something you like or enjoy. You get that chill feeling that rushes over you, but for me its always been a pleasent thing, where I feel my body through this wave. 

Ive gone deep enough one time were it felt like my body was vibrating because of the subtle pulses I was creating. 

The weird thing is that the best pulses are created by the absense of thought, but also the feeling of comfortability. Ive been through weeks or even a month were I had been stressed or too hard on myself, and its been harder to channel these euphoric waves.

Can someone help me understand this effect better,
Thank you.",0
"I just recently started getting into mediation, I never thought I had enough time for it so I started doing short 5 minute sessions daily. 

Enjoying it so far but when I deep breathe it hurts a little bit. Like I start wheezing and I can feel my throat tighten. Definitely doesn’t feel relaxing and I’m not sure how to fix it.

"A semi-recent phenomenon I've been experiencing. During meditation, I can intensely focus on and subsequently ""feel"" certain sections of my head. Primarily, its either the very top of my head or the middle of my forehead, but I have had experiences feeling it on the sides of my head or sometimes more internally (not really identifiable anywhere on the outside of my head, I guess I'd say ""lower"" in my brain).

It's hard to describe what it feels like; the best I can give you is that it feels like an increase in pressure or heat in a localized area. I've found that in my deeper meditative states, I can ""drive"" the feeling to different sections of my head by focusing on the different locations.

Interestingly, I now feel it outside of meditation too. Reading a book or studying at work especially trigger it -- mainly high focus activities.

My  biggest obstacle to getting my life in order, down to basic hygiene:  Thoughts as well as (worse) emotions bubbling up. If I could anesthetize  them and be able to ignore my body, at least as a start, I'd probably  be getting out of the house much more regularly (for starters).

More  than anything is the craving for love and appreciation - obviously.  When I am reassured I have something to offer, I am calmer and able to  get my tasks done. I of course can't rely on other people like that,  especially since my obsession is the way I look.

I've  been recommended breathing meditation, and there have been times where  it has had a calming effect. Some other times it has had an irritating  effect.

I have heard there are  meditating techninques that have helped people deal with or reduce  physical pain without medication. I'd love to soak up in those.

I've read Tylenol is an antidote to the pain of social rejection (!) I have indulged in that when I wasn't in physical pain.

I don't have access to weed.

" 

These are some observations I made last night during a session. Hopefully it can help someone else (as I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while and I've read some incredibly helpful posts) 

Lately, I've been quicker and more alert to mood swings. Last night some anxiety crept in related to a social event I had just come back from and I really wanted to study it before I moved on. I've started to think about the judgements I draw on people as reflections of my innermost fears or desires. What's more likely- that I absolutely 100% know the truth about something I'm witnessing, or that I'm drawing conclusions based on what I think or how I feel about the situation? 

The latter is obviously more likely. And if this is the case, it allows me to open up to new possibilities about how wrong I am in believing so many things. Particular with anxiety and depression. Why am I giving such authority to so many paranoid and unwelcome thought patterns? Why do I trust these responses so readily? And also, why do I keep damaging myself with negative and unwanted self-perceptions? 

I've found that a subjective reality like the one we live in is somewhat dependant on our perception of it. There is magic in this if we can learn to influence it in a positive way. Or in my case, at least start questioning it. The sheer fact that there are other ways of viewing things and my way is not the most credible in any sense is like a breath of fresh air. 

Like hey, I don't know. Maybe those people really like me and I'm the one with the self-image problem. Maybe I should work on that instead. ",0

He later came back and pushed me off leading me to fall in front of all of my friends. I was thinking of fighting him right then and there, but then i realized that it just was not worth it, and i just sat somewhere else. I guess im making progress ;)

Edit: Let me clarify something, when i first claimed the seat i put my bag on it,went and got lunch. But apparently this guy pushed my bag off knowing it was mine. So when i came back he was in the lunchline and I asked is anyone sitting here, my friends just said sit down. So then he came back and pushed me off",0
"Healing means to restore balance. Meditation is an expression of the need to heal, to find balance. This why prayer, meditation, self-reflection, service, charity and alignment with the Higher Purpose is so important. Karma doesn't happen to us as much as within us. Creating more constructive causes, yields more constructive effects in daily life.

In order to understand what true health is we must understand karmic tendencies in our own body, speech and mind. Each moment we're generating ripples in our own aura which extend out into the greater Universe, then come back with increased force depending upon the energy given to them. These reactions, or effects create all of our life, experiences and relations with others.

All health, ill-health, success, failures, gains and losses are a result of seeds planted by the energy waves. When our intentions are blended with the Universal Good, we gradually achieve a more harmonious relationship. We are all subject to the Great Law of Karma, which is nested within the Great Law of Compassion.

Any unwanted results are not a punishment as much as the balancing of forces leaving our heart mind, then returning.",0
"Hi,

Title says it all really.  I have been practicing somewhat consistently but feeling restless in my practice.  While I’m focusing on my breath, Im curious about the multitude of different techniques out there and thought I’d ask reddit.

This leads me to my question - do you use an app, music, binaural beats, the sound of silence?  Do you focus on your breath, light, loving kindness?

"I did my first attempt with meditating on a person I have the strongest wish they'd be happy, get anything they want in this world, etc.

"Hi all. I've just recently started meditating again with a committment to making it a daily habit and a lifestyle choice. I decided it would be best for me to get started with audio courses, since I don't really know what I'm doing, and find the guidance helpful to getting started.

What I'm currently struggling with however, is that recently my anxiety has shifted focus from being one purely about myself and surrounding factors, to the far wider scope of our planet and potential collapse of our ecosystems. This shift has been healthy for me on a personal level, but the shift also comes with its own challenges. A lot of the meditations I have done so far have made points of ""understanding that things will get better"" and that ""whatever current negativity there is in your life will pass"" and the issue is that if my mind wanders to these dark places, hearing messages like this seem the opposite of what I currently feel to be the case. 

Given that I have also resolved myself to no longer turning a blind eye to these challenges of our time, it does make this start to meditation feel more challenging as I feel a need for action and urgency on the above issues. Do you have any recommendations for this? Do I need to change my perspective somehow? Should I be following a certain course or aiming for a different outcome with my meditation? I definitely still feel the benefit of the time taken to meditate, but I know how much better it has felt when my scope was so much narrower and my negative emotions were easier to discredit.

TL;DR : Meditations stating how ""everything will get better"" clash with my current fear of the state of the planet deteriorating and dulls the effectivity of my meditations. Please help!",0

"Small background of me. I've been meditating for 3 years now, very consistently since I was 17 years old. I have got hundreds of hours of meditation and went to some meditation courses including a Vipassana Retreat.

What I've seen is a major theme is that I'm constantly aware of all the pain in my body 24/7 and get discomfortable with it. In deep meditation, this fixation subsides for up to an hour or so. But in daily life, since the moment I wake up, I feel lots of discomfortable sensations in my entire torso, belly and chest.

This pain is causing me lots of suffering. Some days I rush to go home to meditate. My goal is to feel bliss and ecstasy on my body. How to deal with this pain? Should I do a month long meditation retreat to learn to accept the pain?

"I've been practicing mindfulness meditation daily for about 3 months now, and I've found that whether I sit alone at home or I walk outside while doing the meditation, the results and benefits are largely the same.

I thought originally that sitting and ""doing as little as possible"" while watching my breath was best. **But whether I sit and stare at the wall, or walk along a path outside, my mind is still creating images.** If I sit alone, I just keep thinking. I can focus on my breath, but the thoughts continue on behind. If I'm walking, my thoughts are replaced instead by the images that change in my sight as I take my walk. And even as I focus on my breath, and basically think as little as possible, my body moves along automatically.

I thought this was interesting in part because it means you can meditate if you walk to work or take some form of non-driving transport (and so save some time in your day). It's also interesting that whether I think or not, my body will just keep doing what it needs to (so worry is truly pointless). I think this latter insight is one of the steps to a greater sense of peace in life.",0

"My big fear of meditation is I'll just end up making no progress in my life. I've seen many people who've meditated for a long time still have emotional outbursts, depression, and are very angry.

I know I ""shouldnt"" put a label on meditation on what it ""should"" or ""should not"" do, but I'm scared. Even my mindfulness teacher, who teaches people with OCD to be present, has depression at times. How can this be? I thought if you meditate enough, you'll have an inner peace hopefully long lasting.

For example, a guy who recently posted here talked about ""stealing back his chair"" and even got shoved out of it. I would've thought that after 6 months of meditation for 30 minutes for him would have had him not care so much that someone stole his chair. Maybe there is a subconscious reason as to why he got pushed out? I would imagine he would accept the situation and be ok with what is. Maybe even forgiving the fellow who stole his chair.

Another example is this girl who went on America's Got Talent claimed to have meditated for a long time. She then had a very big outburst and even crumpled up a piece of paper and threw it at the judges saying ""I'm not a number, I'm a person.""

So my concern is, why do these people still have these problems after meditating for long periods of time? I worry years after meditating I'll still have angry outbursts, still be depressed, still be unforgiving and hateful. I do not understand. Can someone please explain this to me? Thank you.",0

Today I noticed that if I lengthen my breathe on inhales and exhales(even controlling sometimes)I can focus on it much better.

"Hey everyone. I am relatively new to mediation and have a question:

I practice for about thirty minutes at a time and focus on relaxing muscles and body awareness. A few times in my practice I have gotten to a place where I am separate from my body--as if I have detached and my soul/awareness can move around within my own skin/limbs. I'm a total novice, but if I had to label this, then I'd call it hypnosis/trance. And I definitely want to explore it more. How can I do this? Anyone have familiar experience or guidance on more easily getting to this place? I have been able to get here only a few times.

I do self-guided meditations. Spend about five min focusing on breath, the next five body, and the next twenty relaxing each individual muscle. I use the imagery of butter melting on a warm skillet.

"Since clearing my mind Ive realised quite a few things: The few friends I have at the moment are shit and only use me . The popular girls who giggle around me dont think im cute, they think im just a a nerdy anorexic kid.I am ugly as fuck (before meditation I thought I looked half decent). I feel lonelier than ever. I can also sense the joy in others but I can't sense any joy in myself. There is no one who is there for me. The rest of my family is not even realising whats happening to me and frankly they wont care if I told them.


Where did I go wrong?",0
"My mind used to be filled with a constant inner monologue of thoughts, including escapist daydreaming, worry, analysis and imagined conversations. Via drugs I discovered a state where my mind had much longer periods of quiet. Within these periods I felt the world around me in a much more profound way. I noticed a lot more of what's around me, and in association with perception there were more of countless nameless feelings which seem like essences of what I'm perceiving. I guess this could be called seeing more beauty in the world around me, even in what's objectively mundane, common, average or imperfect. It's a state where I can even see beauty in what might objectively be called flaws and imperfections. This state reminded me of early childhood, before a terrible back and forth move from Croatia to Canada which made my mother worse put me into the worse state with constant inner monologue. Over time I learned how to quiet my mind while at the same time intentionally redirecting my focus onto my perception of the external world. I could do this even without drugs. It seemed like this kind of transformation was the main benefit of meditation. 

One time I had a disturbing experience with meditation. After meditation I felt refreshed and energized, and with motivation to take my difficult and emotionally abusive mother for a drive. Talking to her, even just trying to decide where to go, threw away the good state and put me into a worse state than before I meditated. This led to a decrease in interest in meditation.

Now I think I understand what was wrong. I was manipulating my awareness into a greater focus on present moment perception while not allowing a deeper connection to my body and associated emotions relating to sense of self.

Emotions relating to sense of self always seemed to be a source of suffering. If I want something but can't have it, or I don't like the way something is, or I'm afraid about something, then I can suffer about it. It is nicer to not have those concerns. Part of what I did by training myself to focus more on perception of the present moment is blocking out those concerns. But I'm not sure that I was ever very in touch with my body and associated emotions relating to sense of self. Even long ago memories of my childhood in Croatia seem to involve some tension and disconnection relating to this.

This seems like the opposite of what Buddhism talks about. Refusing to follow my own desires can cause suffering. Those emotions relating to sense of self can include various desires which can improve my life if fulfilled, and ignoring them can lead to worse experiences. Or in other words, I don't want to just become more selfless and love other people more; I need to love myself more!

Can meditation be useful for this? Which particular types of meditation or guided meditations are useful?",0
"Recently I’ve heard a lot about Transcendental Meditation and I — for one weak moment — almost got sucked in.

"I know we can use mantras, physical objects, sound etc., but most big teachers that I know of (mingyur rinpoche, Suzuki roshe, chogyam trungpa, pema chodron, Andy puddicombe etc.) all point to focusing on the breath as the go to method so to speak. 

I just wonder why that is - is there something that is inherently ""better"" or easier about it? 

I've been meditating on the breath everyday for 5 years but have recently considered trying another technique since it, to me, isn't the most intuitive and straight forward thing to do (long explanation for another thread) 

Would love to hear if anyone has gone from focusing on breath to another object (not objectless meditation) and what their experience was. I'm considering mantra but don't really know",0

"Have you ever listened to someone and there voice has a calming or relaxing effect on you?  Voices have powerful effects, so just by the way you speak and the intention you have while speaking can effect people.  In the book 'The Four Agreements' one of the agreements is ""Be Impeccable with your word"".

"I have been a meditating effectively regularly for about 3 years. Mainly doing breathing meditation. Although, I have experience with other techniques like vipassana.

I have noticed a gradual change in my thinking patterns where I become aware of thoughts and emotions faster. But, there are those deeper kind of emotions that my mind doesn't  vocalize which I become aware of only rarely. For example, if there is a task that I do not like and am putting off doing, this dread takes me a long time to become aware of.

Is there a meditation technique that is geared towards becoming aware of these kind of emotions that your mind doesn't vocalize ?",0

I dont really recall why or how it happened, but for maybe a few seconds or maybe even a minute, I experienced an intense pleasure that I cant describe. All I remeber is that it felt really good, not like temporary pleasure, but rather a deep fufilling sensation. 

I have never been able to replicate that sensation, probably because I was consciously trying to achive that state, but I really want to get back into it once I have more time.

"I'm using ""pull"" for lack of a better term here.

Since starting my inward journey, I always felt like I was pretty good about not being attached to anything. Of course, I never had any frame of reference for that feeling other than my past self.

However, during meditation today, I noticed inside myself that I had a slight ""pull"" towards the things I'm attached to. Imagine you're at work: during the day, you have this unconscious awareness of the general direction of your home, and this awareness of where your car is in the parking lot, all sort of unconsciously drawing your attention to them ever so slightly, even though you can't even see them. You probably also get the same effect when you put your phone down. That's the ""pull"" I'm talking about.

When I noticed this energy I was exerting towards the objects I was attached to, I made a conscious effort to sort of ""draw it back in,"" if you will. This allowed me to meditate with myself in such a way I had never experienced before.

Now, even afterwards, my draw towards other unhelpful things I used to really identify with (like drinking, watching TV, playing videogames) all have noticeably less control over me, and more meditation is honestly at the front of my mind now. I would highly suggest everyone try this out if they haven't yet. I can't promise it will have the same effect for you as it did for me, but I can promise that my effect was profound enough to warrant me sharing my first post on this sub! Good luck!",0

Please give it a chance and try it out. Meditating certainly isn't the only way you can help to create peace. There is much that needs to happen in the physical realm as well.

You can do the meditations on this site, even if it is not the exact time of  the meditation schedule. There are also many other different mass meditations on the home page of the website I linked.

The following link is a few free pages about how to do the merkaba meditation (recreating your human lightbody)-

This meditation, if done while feeling love energy, will release negativity and blockages from your chakras and open them up, thus restoring proper energy flow in your body, and improving your health. It can also change your consciousness to a higher dimensional awareness of peace, love and harmony with all life everywhere.


I highly suggest giving this meditation a try. Here is a guided audio link on YT of the merkaba meditation:

Its from the book ""the ancient secrets of the flower of life part 2"".  The book also teaches spiritual anatomy of your 13 chakras,  healing, psychic powers, how to cast out entities/demons from your energy field, how to reconnect to mother earth,  the cosmos and your higher self,  and talks about a few intergalactic conspiracies and the current great awakening!


Here is another very useful meditation called the unity breath. It goes hand in hand with merkaba meditation. It will allow you to tap into a stream of infinite healing love energy:

"Do you need supervised guidance to learn how to meditate? Or can you teach yourself from simple instructions from for example a video? I've been dabbling with meditation for some years, and am wondering if it is just one of those things you won't make proper progress without supervision of some sorts.

In particular, I'm reading about Acem meditation, a book called The Power of the Wandering Mind. Acem meditation is a type of mantra meditation which they call a non-directive technique. They seem to be holding some of the cards close, and I'm sceptical whether they are more interested in making money from their business, then they are about spending knowledge about meditation. The book is very interesting however.

Edit: Thanks for the responses. My conclusion is that while you can learn to meditate self-taught, you get farther with a teacher and a community. I also feel like no one has a patent on what is the key to correct meditation, so there is little reason to go to an expensive retreat to learn a specific technique. I think also if you don't always have a teacher or a community, talking to a friend who also meditates may be valuable.",0

"Hey all! 

Thanks for taking the time to check out my post. I really want to share two experiences I've had over the last few days :)

First  is- I've recently gotten my dedicated Puja table set up- it's nothing big or fancy- it's actually a very old vanity bench that used to be my grandmother's. I covered it with a pashmina and decorated it with a couple small candles, a little Ganesha lamp, some books (The Bhavagah-Gita, Be Here Now by Ram Dass, and Secret Heart- a collection of Rumi poems), other likenesses of enlightened beings. I love it. It's really nice to have that space just for me and just for Sadhana.  But I've noticed now when I come out of mediation my dog Roxie and my cat Luna are always with me. Roxie on my left, Luna on my right. I just think that is the sweetest, most beautiful thing ever. They have such sheet souls- and I never call them in there with me- I start my meditation practice alone and when I end and open my eyes, they are there. &lt;3 Anyone else have this experience?

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, last week I got really lucky and found a copy of The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying by Sogyal Rinpoche at a local used book store. I've been interested in reading this book for quite some time. On Thursday night when I started reading, as I carefully moved through the pages I felt my body expanding bigger and bigger...It was almos tlike I was tripping...I kept blinking and  looking at the words harder ad harder-knowing I was holding the book incapable of explainging the sensation with any logic.  It was magic. I felt as big as the trees in the front yard!

"I feel I already basically know what the form of the answer is going to be to this question; ""...there are many differing schools of thought..."", ""...it's difficult to say..."", etc., but I was wondering if there was any general consensus on the reality of becoming truly enlightened, and if it's considered to be an objective and absolute state of mind inside/outside of Buddhism. Is it a ""0 or 1"" type thing or can somebody be only slightly enlightened? Is there a science to being sure of the claims made about any of this outside of experiencing it for oneself? I've had some experiences with psychedelics that have surely pushed the upper bounds of how in-the-moment and one-with-everything a person can be. Is there a good reason to believe that these experiences were very different from achieving this state of mind naturally? Thanks for any considerable thoughts.",0

"Read Part 1 here: [https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/d2sbwg/why_is_meditation_so_hard_because_of_the_monkey/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/d2sbwg/why_is_meditation_so_hard_because_of_the_monkey/)


My previous article, Why Meditation is so hard had one comment that resonated with a lot of people:



*we are stuck in the space between hell and heaven. The Light has come, so we can’t go back to the old ways. But the monkey is also still there, so we don’t feel peaceful either.*

*This is the worst state to be, because you feel you have lost the material world, but not yet gained the spiritual.*





## My Own Struggle



At one point, I loved video games. I could easily spend hours stuck in a game.



Then I grew bored of them-- I felt they were exactly like real life, exactly **like work**, in fact. You do a lot of pointless actions that lead to pointless results. Kill zombie, move to 2nd floor, kill bad guys, get key, rinse and repeat. I felt the games were like life-- a lot of routine and mechnical grinding work for no real benefit. Soon, I had dozens of games I had paid, but never finished.


I also was writing books, novels and trying to build a business, but all these things started feeling hollow to me. I was like, why am I doing  this? I had started all of it to make money, become famous, to Be The Man(TM), but it all felt fake and meaningless. 



## The Dissolution of the Ego, and it's Attempt to Recreate Itself



Meditation leads to a weakening (and eventual dissolution) of the ego-- and by ego I mean the attachment  to our routine thinking mind. The mind starts thinking it is the boss, and starts bullying the body and other thoughts around, which leads to most of our problems.



In my own example, I  used to think I was this *Stud Muffin Writer / Programmer / Soon to be Millionaire Businessman*(TM) . I couldn't sit quietly for 2 minutes- I always had to be doing something. And boy was my productivity high. I was writing novels, a popular blog, selling online courses. I could do anything...



... except sit quiet for 2  minutes. Anytime I tried to meditate, I would get angry. As in, mouth frothing mad dog angry. I tried to power through it, but now realise this is a horrible way. A better way (if meditation makes you angry) is to practice compassion and forgiveness, but that is another topic (let me know if you want me to write about it).



So recently, when I started losing my interest in all things I did, I felt I was going mad. As I told my wife, if I am not a writer / business guy, *what am I?* As Raman Maharishi said, something I felt was very stupid, **Who am I?** 



(I since found out from Adyashanti that a better meditation is **What am I?**)



And so I felt lost and hopeless. I had lost all my interests, but had not gained any spiritual benefits. I still felt f'in miserable. 



And this is a big problem-- meditation weakens the ego, it's hold on the body/mind, but the ego fights back. It has been the boss for so long, it ain't gonna give up just cause you chanted *Om shanti shanti* a few times.


And this is another problem many meditators face. Marketing tells them meditation should make them feel all *lubby dubby*, floating the in the air giving hugs to strangers. In practice, they feel shit. This is because there is a huge gap between marketing and the hard truth on the street. Meditation is a not a pill you can pop to cure your depression, no matter what all those best selling books say!

And so the ego tries to trick you:



* It makes you feel hopeless and lost

* You might feel you are going crazy

* You might feel everything is an illusion, that nothing matters anyway (*which if true, why do you feel so miserable? The ego has no answer, only doubts*)



Many people give up. I have given up too. Giving up is ok, because your inner self will not let you quit that easy; it will always bring you back, gently and slowly.


## The Battle Between Passions and Peace



And so we come back to our original problem. What do we do when we lose the material world, but haven't gained the spiritual world?



As I said, meditation, over time, leads to a weakening of the ego. The ego is our identification to the non-stop stream of thinking.

The problem is— the mind wants something to “identify” with, something external. So it will keep trying to create an identity for you, and feel depressed. The hopelessness and groundlessness you feel is **not you, it is the mind**. the mind feels out of control and helpless.

The mind **wants** something to grab on to, something to hold, something to give it stability. That is  why it is so scared all the time, because ultimately, there *is nothing to hold on to*. The ego, like I’ve written before, is like a soap bubble floating in the sun. It has no existence, it can pop anytime, and worst of all (from the ego’s viewpoint), **it knows this**.

And so the ego is scared all the time. It fights your meditation, it throws a tantrum anytime you make any progress, it makes you think you are crazy, or losing it, or wasting your time. 

And we haven’t even talked about passions.

### What Stars Wars taught me about meditation

*Go on, Luke, give in to your passions. Give in to the hate, and you will be with the Dark side* — a dude called Palpatine

For a long time, I couldn’t understand why the Emperor walked Luke to give in to his passions.

Nowadays, passion means good things. Silicon Valley wants you to be “passionate” about your job, by which they mean be willing to work overtime without extra pay. We are expected to “follow our passions”, and you are screwed if your passion is something that doesn’t make money, like collecting stamps or writing poetry. No, your passion has to be about something the market wants, like Jabbascript programming or accounting or family law. Yawn.

But passion originally meant suffering. Check the dictionary. The “Passion of the Christ” is not a story about how Jesus built a Web 2.0 blog using FaceTube.

Passions, if the you read the original Greek stoic texts, are run away emotions that take over us. They happen most commonly during meditation— if you have felt really angry or depressed or emotional during meditation, those are passions. We usually keep them suppressed by distracting ourselves, but they jump up and take over the mind anytime we are vulnerable, like hungry or tired, or when we try to sit quietly.

So the Emperor wasn’t asking Luke to work on his passion to build a Wordpress blog; he was telling him to let his wild emotions, raw anger and fear, take over, and let them rule his life.

We have all heard of examples of this.  Anytime you hear of someone killing another person in a road rage incident, they gave in to their passions. Their emotions went out of control and took over the mind. The rational mind became a passenger at this point. It could complain, but it wasn’t the one driving.

You have felt the passions too-- anytime you have screamed at a loved one, spouse, parents or children, and almost or completely destroyed your relationship. You may have later felt ashamed, feeling like you had been possessed by a demon.

And you were. This demon is the monkey, plus all the pent up rage and emotions you have been suppressing your whole life. At some point, all that shit just blows up.

And that is the 2nd reason meditation is so hard. We have been suppressing  our emotions, suppressing the monkey within us so long, he waits when we are weak and vulnerable and strikes back.

Like I said in the previous post, you have to make peace with the monkey, not fight him.

One way to control passions is to practice compassion and forgiveness. All real spiritual paths have compassion or service as a core tenet. Buddhists have metta, Hindus have kshama/seva, while Christianity was based on forgiveness (no comment on how well these religions do this in practice).

Compassion and forgiveness is what brings the monkey under control, because they are the things he cannot fake; the monkey (or ego) can pretend to be a great enlightened guru, he can give inspiring speeches, and be all spiritual; but he can never show compassion or forgiveness. And hence never feel peace.   

### Forgiveness is the Key to Fast Meditation

The mind is like a hot stove, red hot with heat. It burns you, causes you discomfort, but you can't turn off the heat.

Meditation is the key to cooling the mind- meditation is what turns the heat off.

Compassion/Forgiveness is like sprinkling cold water with your fingers on the stove. It speeds up the cooling process. You don't need compassion, but without it the journey will take a lot longer.

Which is why meditation can't be something you ""do"" for an hour each day, then go about your normal life. Meditation is something that must be done throughout the day (to the best of your ability, remembering that self shaming is a weapon of the ego, and self-compassion is the best form of compassion).

Once you stop putting in heat into the mind (in the form of angry / hateful thoughts), the mind will eventually cool down, giving you the peace you want. It just takes time.

"It has been often said, both in Vedic, Buddhist and other writings that if we want accomplishment, develop a dispassionate attitude towards results. This runs counter to our Western society which says, if you can't measure it, it doesn't exist.

The ancient wisdom found in the Vedas, Buddhism and long standing wisdom traditions is based in an understanding of faith in karmic methods in order to create an atmosphere in the mind where good will emerge more easily if the motivation for practice is purified. Hence, the need for increased communal awareness, Bodhicita and compassion. In a real sense, your practice is part of a reorientation for the welfare of not only yourself, but the space of the world around you.  What benefits you, will in turn benefit the community. There is an inherent interdependence between all of us, especially those working diligently to improve the quality of life for humanity as a whole.

At the outset of meditation practice, think of the welfare of yourself as linked to those you know, love and cherish. Then think of the larger spheres of friends, colleagues, neighbors, and continuing outward.

"Don't even know where to start with this. I sat down and set insight timer to 35 minutes. Began with some focus on the breath and tried my best to center myself and distance myself from surface level thoughts.

Got that done pretty quickly so then I started to become aware of my emotional state a bit and just as I was about to do it - a wild boner appears. So I try my best to focus on that sensation but it becomes a struggle not to be distracted by overly sexual thoughts and/or desires. Eventually I recenter myself and the boner subsides. But then I get a few more boners one after the other. At this point I know how the whole cycle goes so I manage to be pretty aware of it all, just an observer.

Ok great, passed that ""level"". At this point I'm feeling pretty deep into the session and the ending bell already went off a bit before. but I decided to keep going. I start to notice this lingering tension around my right shoulder, probably a point in my upper trapezius actually. So I decide to put all my focus on that. Soon after I just feel this radiation of tension and pain through my entire upper trapezius, shoulder, neck. First the entire right side radiates and then I feel some of my left. I try my best to just observe. Moment after moment this radiation just becomes stronger and stronger. At this point I feel like my body is burning and there is nothing to be felt or observed except that immense tension and pain.

Can't explain this better than like this: I know that the pain is just in my upper body but it felt like it was all there is, that that pain IS my body and nothing else. This becomes more and more difficult to keep doing and I try my best to just let it all go but I just couldn't. So I keep observing it for as long as I could but eventually I just abruptly stopped my session.

I took my phone and checked insight timer: 55 minutes.  
When I stopped the session I was left with a feeling of huge soreness and pain and still that higher body temperature. It felt something like I overdid it in the gym and was incredibly sore from it + that somebody beat me up real good after that gym session.

So now after this I'm a bit more aware of all the tension and pain that I'm storing inside of myself. Not a pretty sight at all. I guess all I can do is keep going and eventually let it all go.

If anyone has any advice on how I could do this, it would be much appreciated. Thanks!",0

"*""The point of meditation is not to discover some cool techniques to occupy your leisure hours; it's to make the simple but momentous shift from doing to being.

"So I posted previously, a couple of weeks ago I think that I has a feeling of tremendous joy envelop me while meditating.

I haven't tried to chase that, I don't meditate for that reason, but have only felt that again fleetingly.

Since yesterday or so, I've had a feeling following me around like I'm about to ""break through"" whatever on earth that means and the sensation of joy came again to me during my meditation session I just finished along with a feeling of heat and passed quite quickly.

To try and describe it, it's almost like something sat on the top of my head while meditating, and like something following me around constantly (sounds like I'm going mad, I know) and also like I could perceive it but not quite, if that makes sense.

I hope this makes sense to someone. I know this is because of my meditation practice and because of the sensation of joy that I get during meditation.

Thanks for hearing me out.",0

"I’ve been meditating for a short period of time , probably a little over four months on a daily basis for around 15 mins a day . I have started to notice a lot of feelings of insecurity and self-doubt come to the surface.

Is this my internal self showing me these are things that I need to work on?",0
"**BACKGROUND**

I live in Botswana, where meditation retreats are very elite, therefore I can only go to my dad's cattle-post instead. I'm a novice and have been meditating sparingly but it's my goal to get back on track, beginning with a retreat, before the end of the year (October 10-21 are my only free consecutive dates). This will be without a teacher so the plan will look something like [this; at #4](http://www.7goldfish.com/10_things_learned_in_10_day_vipassina), i.e. daily Schedule below, only with a few exceptions (noted by \*).

## Daily Schedule

4:00 am Morning wake-up bell  
4:30-6:30 am Meditate in the hall or in your room  
6:30-8:00 am Breakfast break (\*while talking to dad sparingly)  
8:00-9:00 am Group meditation in the hall  
9:00-11:00 am Meditate in the hall or in your room according to the teacher's instructions (\*TMI book reading session)  
11:00-12:00 noon Lunch break (\*while talking to dad sparingly)  
12noon-1:00 pm Rest and interviews with the teacher (\*TMI book reading session)  
1:00-2:30 pm Meditate in the hall or in your room  
2:30-3:30 pm Group meditation in the hall  
3:30-5:00 pm Meditate in the hall or in your own room according to the teacher's instructions  
5:00-6:00 pm Tea break (\*while talking to dad sparingly)  
6:00-7:00 pm Group meditation in the hall  
7:00-8:15 pm Teacher's Discourse in the hall (\*TMI book reading session)  
8:15-9:00 pm Group meditation in the hall  
9:00-9:30 pm Question time in the hall (\*TMI book reading session / 'journal-ling' the day's biggest lessons, briefly)  
9:30 pm Retire to your own room--Lights out

.....................................................................

**QUESTIONS**

1. Should I take my TMI book with me?
2. Is it advisable to do any physical exercise?
3. Would 'journal-ling' help? My therapist vaguely recommended it but I'm not sure if it'll help to do that during the retreat, or after.
4. Any \[other\] changes I can make to get the best out of this?",0
"For me, I recently found this guy, Francis Lucille, who explains things in an absolutely crystal clear manner, probably due to his past background as a scientist/mathematician. I find that a lot of teachers from religious/new age backgrounds tend to result in me getting more confused as I struggle to grasp their nomenclature, even though I am personally more inclined towards the woo-woo and the emotive rather than the rational. Atheistic teachers like Sam Harris also tend to leave me cold for some reason.

So, which teachers or approaches do you follow? What has worked for you so far?",0
"I've been meditating daily since January this year, usually 4 times a day for 15 minutes. I used to have a lot of anxiety and negative thinking patterns but over time with meditation these have faded. I'm a lot more positive and optimistic and I don't really experience anxiety everyday like I used, however I still get some every now and again.

Since the end of April this year I would meditate and experience a kind of heightened awareness of everything around me that would last several hours. I would get better clarity of my vision and I felt more in the present moment than I ever have. Everytime I meditated I would usually feel these effects. 

This lasted till a few weeks ago and now when I mediate I still practice the same techniques however it feels like I don't get the same effects or I do they just feel a lot weaker.

Has anyone had this before where it seems like 
the effects of meditation is plateuing?

Edit: The techniques I use are I start by paying attention to the sound around me and just noticing all sound as noise not giving them any specific name just noise, I then do some breathing meditation followed by a body scan and some visualisation, I'll then do some breathing techniques where I'll inhale for 3 seconds, hold for 3 and exhale for 3 and continue doing this for a while. Recently as of two weeks ago, I finish with some metta meditation, although I'm fairly new to this type of meditation so I'm still learning. I think the main form of meditation I practice and have a good understanding of is mindfulness.",0

"I can’t find a perfect place to meditate. Everywhere around me is noisy, I have to share my room with others and  I don’t want them to find me meditating. So I do it after everybody’s asleep.",0
"So I went through a really bad breakup.  I wasn't in a good place when I started the relationship and I got attached to this guy and was incredibly insecure. The breakup was terrible, I became obsessed with wanting answers and trying to fix it. This is a tendency of mine I forgot to be mindful of this time around.

But I finally did it. It's difficult to explain, but I let it go. I let him think whatever it is that he thinks of me. I accepted that our path was meant to end here. There is no need to fix it, no need to explain, no need to control it anymore. And this letting go has ""transferred"" itself into everything else as well. And one funny thing is that my rather chronic shoulder tension has been melting away. I'm able to simply sit back and observe and allow even if there is still lingering sadness. It's so much more peaceful, now.",0

"A tiger just listens to his biology and he's already a full fledged tiger but the human beings plight is different. Being a human means your biology is in your hands.  Now when you become compulsive and listen to your cravings and do things on autopilot you're not experiencing life as a human **being.** Once you act **consciously** from the way you sit, stand, talk, breath, think, your posture etc then you're being a human being and you can evolve.  We've been acting compusivley for a while so there's going to be a time delay and a learning curve but that's why persistence is key. It doesn't matter if you fail 100 times today you will try again, and if you fail 100 more times you'll try again. Lots of people don't start living until they're on their death bed which is tragic, let's not wait until then. It doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it consciously.",0
"So I have this type of mindfulness, mediation, I don't really know what to call it, that involves making sure the feeling one each lateral half (downt the vertical axis) of the face is 'balanced' or 'even'.

"I’ve been seeing a lot of similar things since joining this sub. That I’m not my thoughts. That I’m not my emotions. That I’m not solely my body or my mind. That I’m not my mistakes. 

So what am I? My actions? I have trouble with that concept. I have had serious problems with self worth. I tend to define myself by my accomplishments or peoples perceptions/words about me. 

How do I know who I am? What should I be searching for? What if I don’t like who or what I am?",0
"In my humble opinion, one of the biggest myths about meditation is that to meditate means to empty your mind. Stillness of the mind is something that may take years and years to reach. If a beginner sets out to meditate with this unrealistic goal, it's a sure way to lose motivation and give up meditation. That's exactly what happened to me about 4 years ago because I believed this myth too. A lot of people don't even start meditation because they feel THEIR mind has non-stop thoughts. 

I believe the goal of meditation, especially for a beginner, is to OBSERVE one's thoughts, not stop them. 

I made this short video to clarify this idea and offer some tips for beginners.

"I've been meditating for a few months now and have gotten up to doing 30-40 minute sessions. Usually just samatha alone, I have started to get down the breath concentration pretty well. But everytime I try to go into vipassana meditation from samatha I start getting distracted with my mind wandering much more than with samatha. Its frustrating. I do the noting technique when i do vipassana, noting my abdomen movements rising falling etc. Whenever my mind wanders I always note it and return to my abdomen when I realize I've drifted off. 

I'm wondering if I should continue doing this practice and it will get easier, or do I need to keep practicing samatha and eventually go back to vipassana. Am I doing something wrong? Or should I just keep at it and push through?",0
"Yesterday, my mother suggested I meditate and something in me really wanted to, so later in the evening I meditated after yoga for 9 minutes with a meditation playlist in the background. I was really surprised once I came out of my meditation. Inside I felt much more calm and during the meditation, I felt a vibration in my mouth that slowly grew on my chest and one portion of my face. Once I finished meditating, I let out a little cry that was satisfying and joyous. Along with that, for part of yesterday and today I’ve had more realizations and contentment about my life. Today, I meditated again and felt like I was in water. I had slight passing vibrations that weren’t as strong during my 12 minute session. I’m hoping to continue meditating every day now despite having school, but I’m really surprised my first time went well.",0

**FULL REVIEW** 

Video review: [https://www.facebook.com/liveanddare/videos/905385073160464/](https://www.facebook.com/liveanddare/videos/905385073160464/)

Links and research [here](https://liveanddare.com/mantra-meditation#Transcendental_Meditation).

&amp;#x200B;

**Overview / Summary**

I'm often asked if I recommend the TM technique/organization. I don't. And this video I discuss 5 reasons why not.  
(1) Identity Confusion — it's a spiritual approach to mantra meditation disguised as secular.

(2) Questionable Marketing — ex-TM teachers (and whistleblowers) have come out to say that the mantras are not unique to the individual. If that is the case, they shouldn't be advertized as if they were.

(3) The Effortlessness Myth — the core assumption of TM about meditation is flimsy at best.

(4) Cultish Background — More a problem in the past than right now, but worth being aware of. Warnings have been issued about the dangers of TM by the German government, the Vatican, the Cult Awareness Network, the Task Force on Missionaries and Cults

(5) Dubious Research — the papers that TM is based on to argue its ""superiority"" over styles of meditation are weak, and their conclusions are dubious.

(Note: all of this is just my own opinion, made based on many hours of research and talking with long-term TM practitioners.)

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think?",0
"I always found the idea of meditation to be sitting in quiet contemplation.

I was stupid wrong.

I’ve found through physical therapy that certain poses have certain spiritual energy surrounding them.

I honestly don’t know how to put it better but it’s something I can replicate and reproduce every time I get down on the floor now. It’s very weird.

If I hold these poses long enough I can feel the dissolving of my surroundings and my connection to my sensations

It’s like having both a physical and mental alignment in my imagination like a perfectly still unbroken surface of a lake.

It’s extremely visceral and gives me the shudders in an almost creepy way and I’ve lost time stuck in this moment of static energy.

Like balancing a pin perfect on its tip or walking an internal tightrope with your body.

It also has had massive implications in how interpret my own thinking and impulses, realising now they are truly optional",0
"When I meditate before bed I often feel a surge of serious restlessness and the need to move. I try to fight through it but I feel so uncomfortable to the point that after a minute of two I have to stop meditating. However, when I meditate 15 mins after I wake up it’s relaxing and I often try to stop my self from falling asleep. Not sure if it’s relevant but I have adhd which could be a factor in this happening. Also for contest I’ve been meditating 10-30 mins for 6 months consistently",0
"Recently meditation has been more than amazing for me (specially because I switch from doing so only at night and doing it in the morning as well) but I get a little stressed sometimes if I meditate less than an hour, thinking what my day will be without the ""right amount of time"".",0
"I've found lately that my favorite form of meditation is going for a walk without my cell phone. My imagination comes to me instantly as I wander through my subdivision, staring up at the pale blue sky. I love to cloud watch as I walk. I feel my mind instantly wanting to soar through the clouds like an airplane. Especially when you can see the shape of the moon peeking through the clouds in the evening sky. I imagine myself to feel weightless, although I am walking and my feet remain on the Earth. I take a deep breath and all of me is drifting away.",0
" 

I have found that those with **energy imbalance/grounding issues** look for guidance everywhere. They search all over the internet - read many articles, blogs, forums ; meet many doctors and therapists ; spends a lot of time, money and energy, yet they did not find something substantial that could give them the confidence that the problem could be solved in short span of time.

Many lose hope. Many lose the most important years of their life; some lose their jobs, relationships,etc.

For whatever this may have happened, I would always suggest someone to **learn from authentic teachers/organisation** who have years of specialisation  in this area.

I have done a lot of research on this topic.

A **Multi-prong approach** is needed to deal with this issue-

1. **GROUNDING EXERCISES-**

After unprepared awakening, energy gets stuck especially in throat, back of head, sinuses, shoulders,etc.

I am of the opinion that if we can **clear air passage ways with certain exercises** (TMJ, Neck, Sinus release exercises) , then its going to make huge difference in the way one feels.

All this exercises are aimed to - **clear Nasal pathway for air** and later **direct flow of breath along central channel of energy** **(Sushumna nadi)**.

We want **more and more air to flow through nose**, so that intensity of ""**fight and flight**"" mode can be reduced drastically. We are trying to hit from different angle to clear nose while doing the TMJ, neck, sinus release exercises.

I believe that many of the important psychic channels are in nose. So **clearing nasal passage** is of immense importance in dealing with energy imbalance issue.

Here are exercises you can consider doing-

* **ZHANG ZHUANG QIGONG STANDING MEDITATION**
* **DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING**
* **SINUS, NECK, TMJ EXERCISES**
* **STANDING MEDITATION- THE MASTER EXERCISE FOR ALL ENERGY IMBALANCE ISSUES**

&amp;#x200B;

2. **UNVEILING KNOT/GRANTHI IN NAVEL REGION-**

Brahma Granthi creates restlessness and inability to meditate. To unveil it one has to rise above thoughts, emotions and ego associated with lower 3 chakras with awareness and faith. Knowledge and awareness is the key. I'll give suggested book list.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Brahma Granthi is the first major block that sadhaka need to transcend. This granthi keeps a person under the illusion of the material benefits, physical pleasures, lethargy, ignorance and uncertainty.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Among all the most powerful is an illusion of physical pleasure. This granthi plays an important role, because it is responsible for the material man's thinking. It creates a kind of attraction in the nature of the human mind.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Illusions that are created by Brahma Granthi, may be represented as:  
• Permanent sexual thoughts and sexual activity  
• Permanent hunger, which is difficult to satisfy  
• Need of money, land and other tangible things  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The opening of this knot may also be due to some problems for the sadhaka, because it causes a strong increase of fever, a very strong desire of sexual satisfaction and a strong motivation for the material desires.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The work of this granthi associated with three major chakras - Muladhara chakra, Svadhishthana chakra and Manipur chakra.

&amp;#x200B;

One has to become **hollow and empty** from within. **Freeing subconscious and unconscious mind of suppressed/unconscious emotions and ego with knowledge and awareness is the key to unveil this knot.** One should be able to identify and differentiate between emotion/set of emotions/different flavours of ego when they arise in nervous system.

&amp;#x200B;

* **CRANIAL OSTEOPATHY/ CRANIOSACRAL THERAPY**

&amp;#x200B;

* **BACH FLOWER REMEDY**

It helps to **dissolve negative emotions** in the system like fear, uncertainty, over sensitivity, lack of interest, etc and **helps the body heal itself**.

When you forcefully awaken the energy, it tries to get rid of all the negativity or suppressed emotions from system and the Bach flower Remedy speeds up this process.

I highly recommend BACH FLOWER REMEDY.

HOPE THESE HELPS!! ALL THE BEST!!",0
"In a 2018 paper about monastic academies of the future, M. Bukiet lists three classic texts documenting the work of contemplative adepts. He thinks these will be central teachings for all future contemplatives.

&gt;Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras  
&gt;  
&gt;Tsongkhapa’s “The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment”  
&gt;  
&gt;Buddhaghosa’s “The Path of Purification”

I have not read the last two but plan to look into them for consideration. My current top three are:

* Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras
* Takpo Tashi Namgyal’s “Mahamudra: The Quintessence of Mind and Meditation
* Harold D. Roth trans. of “Original Tao: Inward Training (Nei-yeh)""

I know that there are many here that probably have many other resources in mind, not just three. But if you had to rank ***your top three*** resources for mediation purposes, what would they be?

"I normally do sitting meditation but lately I've been trying to meditate while lying in bed, either on my back or on my side, but it's like I can't even get started. I don't understand it, it's like I can't focus on the breath while having it ""feel good"" like it does in sitting meditation. Anyone know why this might be? Sometimes I can focus on the breath while lying down but it seems like it doesn't really go anywhere, like it's just a mechanical process or me forcing myself to follow the breath. 

Also what is really funny is that when I do sitting meditation too late at night, I'll get very drowsy and start nodding off, however, when I lay down in bed to go to sleep I am suddenly wide awake, and so I try to meditate laying down, and it doesn't make me sleepy at all, lol.",0
"I've been really wanting to get into meditation; I love the idea behind it and I see how powerful it can be. I've been reading the book 'The Mind Illuminated' to try and help me on this journey, the only issue is I was doing great with it. I was making a daily habit with mediation, I did for about a month, I got my practice up to 25-30 minutes a day. Life was good. It was easy to do with a still mind.

Well, things have changed. A lot of problems have risen within my family life, work life, and relationship life. Simply put, there are some BIG changes coming which are perceived as negative as of right now.. with all of these issues, my anxiety, depression, stress has been at an all time max. it constantly feels like my mind is cluttered and going a million miles an hour. I began putting meditation to the side because I felt too depressed to even try, it was too much ""effort"". I want to bring it back into my life because I felt like before I was just beginning to get the positive effects from meditation.. now each time I try and sit I can't seem to shut off that constant chatter, the obsessing looping thoughts - no matter how hard I try I can't push them away and focus on my breath. Being mindful has been difficult because things have been going to badly, it's almost as if I subconsciously do not want to be in the moment. 

How do I stop this and get that focus back?",0
How do I get back into meditation habit? I used to feel so good but I can’t do it recently these last few months have been rough since I got depersonalization. Meditation helped but now that it’s not as bad I stopped. I really need to mediate but for some reason I just can’t. I feel like crying right now. My mind is so mean to me. I tell myself I can’t feel love and I’m selfish and it’s not true I think I hope I just feel so lost right now. I don’t know how to act or what to do or what is right in social situations. I don’t know if this is what it’s like to be an adult or what happens when you leave adolescence behind but I can’t stop thinking about myself and I’m so insecure. Meditation used to make me feel so calm and good I feel like an asshole lately. I don’t even know why I’m wrong this right now. I used to think  it was cool to be a sociopath and it was a weird phase I idolized them but now everyone I see the word empathy my brain automatically is like “you don’t feel that” I’m crying now and my brain is fucked.,0
"The classic teaching on The Four Thoughts That Turn the Mind from Samsara, has helped me greatly to maintain a deep motivation to practice over the past three decades.  I'll share the opening lines which HH the 17th Karmapa gave several years ago. It's my belief that if you use these four thoughts to assist you in maintaining momentum in your daily life as well as practices, this will propel you along the way more consistently. Here's a short except, and the rest can be engaged from the attached link.

The Seventeenth Karmapa began his teaching by naming the Four Thoughts That Turn the Mind from Samsara: (1) the precious human rebirth; (2) death and impermanence; (3) karma as cause and effect; and (4) the defects of samsara.

"Earlier today I was at a grocery store, which was crowded because it's the weekend. Sometimes I get thoughts about how other people might judge me about various aspects of my behaviour there. These thoughts link to an unpleasant tense feeling which I guess involves anxiety and maybe shame. Somehow I let go of these thoughts, somehow just letting them be and not attaching them to my concept of self in the way which brought up those feelings. I felt a notable relief and a greater presence in the external world.

It wasn't like the thoughts weren't mine. Though I also can't say they seemed very clearly mine. It was more like I wasn't giving them the kind of significance found when I'm learning about and figuring out reality. They were just thoughts which appeared, not any kind of truth which was important and which I have to concern myself with.

When I did this, the thoughts faded. It seems the grasping at them which comes from feeling they are significant intensifies and prolongs them.

I'm not 100% certain that this is an okay thing to do. Afterwards I was wondering if it was escapist. Sometimes it seems I experience concerns about myself via anxiety about other people judging me for activities which aren't very loving to myself. In the more distant past, I used to buy sweet baked goods regularly at a grocery store, and I was anxious about cashiers judging me for that. Those things are unhealthy, and it's like the part of me which didn't want them expressed itself that way. Simply letting go of such things could be a further dissociation from emotions and escapism. I already know how to do various kinds of escapism in my mind, and don't want to learn more. But maybe I should have some faith in how others view this, and maybe it is something better than the escapism I've learned to do on my own in my mind.",0
"I am a creative type with thoughts and ideas always flowing through my head. This type of thinking is necessary for what I do (game development) both for the coding end of things and the creative aspect. It is also an essential part of who I am. Over the past few years I have had several mental disorders get much worse; OCD, anxiety, and ADHD. I also have big problems with discipline and impulse control. I decided I might try to get into to meditation to calm down my mind and help take control of things, however, I have been scared of meditating ever since a few years ago when I read some of The Mind Illuminated and practiced it a bit.

After every time I would meditate, my mind would be completely silent. No thoughts, no ideas, nothing. Even if I tried to conjure something up, it was just like there was nothing to conjure. All I had was pure awareness. It really freaked me out because my mind is usually going a million miles an hour. Obviously a calm mind is desirable, but to the point that it takes away my ability to think and be creative like the way I used to, that would not be good. So is this a normal effect of meditation? Is this something that will in the end make me less imaginative and ambitious? Is this just a step in the process or the end goal?",0
"Hello, r/meditation, I’m a teenage girl who is starting to try meditation I’m on a five day streak with guided meditation and I’m proud of myself.

Does anybody here know short guided meditation apps/playlists from around 3 to 5 minutes 10 I also fine but I don’t know whether I can hold my attention for that long at this stage.

Late last night I was driving and an image of myself popped up in my head from a few years back. The intensity of this image in my head was something I had never experienced before. I have to say it was not good emotions tied a long to it. Shame and embarrassment were the feelings that came to mind. In this moment it was the first time that I had actually truly became disgusted with who I once was. For some reason I feel like this directly tied with meditation as I practice everyday. If any of you have experienced this I would like your opinion on what is happening. Thanks.,0

After I meditate I'm often left with this feeling that I need to let something go. I can feel it welling up inside of me and I always want to cry but I feel unable. I cry very infrequently but I feel like I'm holding on to something that I need to let go of. Any tips on how to allow myself to cry?,0
"If I were trying to meditate on sexual urges I guess it wouldn’t be totally strange to leak semen. However, it just kinda happened during my 30 minute meditation. I have been under a lot of stress lately and dealing with some shame from a traumatic event and usually when this happens I tend to go back to what comforts me as a safety net and that’s usually sexual feelings. During my meditation it was difficult for me to move this energy upward it felt like it was blocked. At the end of my meditation I noticed I had seminal fluid leaking. I’ve also  been practicing semen retention so I’m wondering if I just have too much energy stored right now and I’m not transmuting it correctly.",0

"As of last week I [25/M] decided to stick to meditating and have meditated for 5 consecutive days. I have started a course on Insight Timer for obsessive thinking which is 10-15 mins usually and listen to a love kindness meditate on youtube which is 15 mins. I have actually teared up several times during the love and kindness meditation. 

I’m hitting the gym and working out despite being tired or unmotivated and feel so great after. 

I have not yet fixed a sleeping schedule, but I’m trying my best. I’m sleeping at 1-2AM and waking up at 7:30AM and going back to bed from 10AM-1:30AM. I think this is important too. 

My diet has been very well, but as I am heavy lifting now I do think I need more bigger meals.

However, I still suffer from obsessive thinking. I’m fully aware that there is nothing wrong with me. Throughout the day I have moments of peace and calmness. But also get the occasional moment when I’m too much into my head. And keep obsessively thinking about the question “what if I’m suicidal” and I have seen a therapist about this and she said I show no signs of being suicidal and it’s simply my response mechanism for when I’m stressed. I have talked to friends, and family and everyone says the same thing. I also don’t feel suicidal, I don’t want to die or hurt myself. I actually wanna get rid of these thoughts. I don’t think of anything negative aside from this question. But my anxiety will produce chemicals throughout my body and my face (cheeks) will flair up and this gives me anxiety. 

Has anyone ever overcome this? Am I just too stuck in my head?",0

"I think I’m realizing that my entire life has been focused *against* meditation. I’ve always tried to remember song lyrics for times when I am bored or to try and keep me in a certain mindset while I perform activities. I recite things and cling to memories and try to recreate them in my head in order to remind myself of pain and truth. 

Recently this has been out of my control. Things just attack and invade my head. Everything is an echo. There’s never silence. I can’t look at something without connecting it to everything its related to. I can’t think about anything without turning over every single possibility imaginable. I can’t hear a word without trying to recall every important context of where I’ve heard this word. I can’t learn something new without feeling like I’ll be questioned on it. 

I feel like a slave to my own head and my own emotions. I sought darkness.. and now I feel like I am finally realizing the price I am paying.. Is there a specific type of meditation to help with this?",0
"Im fairly new to meditation, and was actually doing it while trying to have an astral projection.

I suddenly felt this overwhelming sensation that i was ok with death, and literally had a series of memories play in my mind from waaaay back to before i could walk (my first memory, havent revisited it in awhile and honestly forgot about it) and important memories of events in my life played out in chronological order.

It was extremely disturbing in all honesty and im wondering if this is common.

I probably could of just got up at any time but it was like i was in a trance and compelled to watch.

I also realized that i cant remember anything from 3rd grade...

And that my anxiety disorder, self consciousness and concentration issues began in 7th grade (anxiety), and 8th grade (concentration after a severe concussion and self consciousness after serious weight gain).

and depersonalization in 9th grade while in the shower in my old house.

depression last year (i knew this was recent but I was able to finally recall the events leading up to the trigger)

These things all skew perception and make it hard to pinpoint when they really started, but i remembered the exact moment tonight.

Maybe I can use this to really get to the root of my issues and fix them, though...

But by far one of the weirdest experiences of my life.

All this as im escaping alcoholism, im literally still feeling withdrawals.


Id like to add, this wasnt just ""memories"", it was VIVID. Not the typical greyed out old memories where you cant recall detail, it was truly bizzare and probably atypical.",0
"In Buddhism, there is what is called [Two truths doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine). Whatever blissful or mystical experiences one experiences, insights into things like non-self, impermanence, emptiness, they too just pass. Back to the breath. For I will surely get lost in thought again, and that is okay.

Mindfulness meditation leads to forgiveness. With healthy forgiveness and compassion, we do not excuse their behaviour. And we do so while maintaining our healthy boundaries - indeed, healthy boundaries likely result from states of forgiveness: for to reach these states requires forgiveness and compassion for yourself, knowing your own limits and imperfections, and what you deserve from a place of self-love. In fight or flight, I have felt anger. I have felt hatred. I have felt revenge. And when not mindful, it is projection. But, with mindfulness, they too are impermanent. They are not self. They are empty.

When I am not mindful, and that's a fuckload, split thinking and cognitive dissonance are some of my deeply engrained schemas - likely to manifest in and out of my mind until death. Subsequent anger after bouts of forgiveness can lead to perfectionsitic guilt, which regresses back to mind narratives of past and future - and that being my states of forgiveness weren't genuine. More and more, I hold my justified anger with mindfulness, compassion, and forgiveness. It is not mine. It is human emotions functioning, arising out of prior causes and conditions. And I see that forgiveness, like grief, is not linear - it is cyclic and unpredictable. It is not mine to control. And that's fucking cool.

For many, deep pain can be classified as 'trauma'. How bizarre it is to realise that the unconscious mind is in the body. Given that I am susceptible to intellectualise too much (probably these words, haha), when I found this out, it was like, ""what the fuck? Am I the last one to realise? Why didn't you all tell me?!"" How exciting that science is starting to see this more and more - The Body Keeps The Score indeed! And in my own experience, in states of mindfulness and focusing on Buddha's amazingggg three marks of existence, how this pain is not mine. It is inteergenrational trauma. It is unconscious scripts past down like emotional imprints. How curious.

With forgiveness, we are free of the past. We are free of the story between this person, largely fictitious, that reinforces the illusory self. With compassion, we see they did not choose their thoughts or their behaviour. They, too, are victims. And they project their pain onto you, however unconscious.

It is fear or love. Fear will never beat fear. Fear or love. Love. It is all Love.",0
"Like the title suggests, what should I exactly be doing when I meditate? Is it as easy as acknowledging your thoughts and letting them pass by you? How do you even acknowledge your thoughts without thinking about it? For example, would you just think I just thought about X or okay that’s nice but ignore it or just silently ignore it?

I have a feeling I’m missing an essential part about meditation.",0
"This is (roughly) how a friend summarized my explanation after I described the point of meditation.

Just like you train your brain to recognize dreams and gain control over them by repeatedly writing them down in dream diaries, meditation trains the brain to recognize when you live your life on autopilot, follow neurotic patterns, and so on, and puts you back into the driver seat.

It clearly doesn't capture all components of meditation, such as the improved focus, the reduced stress, the reminder that your desires and day-to-day struggles are not as important as you think, ... Yet I think it's quite a nice metaphor for this particular component. :)",0

What will it take to drop clinging to views? (*ditthupadana*)

Most western folks are taught to believe in things, so it is natural for one who is interested in Buddhism to take up many views that are associated with Buddhism.

Here some common beliefs:

1. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds.
2. There is an afterlife.
3. And there are ascetics and brahins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.

There are some good reasons to have these beliefs, and they are very common in Asia and part of the Religion of Buddhism. These are ordinary right views that are common, held by the leaders of society down to the lowest.

There is another way to view things, the Buddha’s noble way. Noble right view is based on wisdom and investigation, to make the mind pure noble and free from ordinary views.

Most Buddhist and other folks who practice anapanasati and/as vipassana generally are looking for leaving dissatisfaction and enter into satisfaction (dukkha-dukkha-niroda), they are looking for freedom. Yet clinging to any of the above views will keep the mind trapped in ordinary views.

So for those who aspire to be free from unsatisfactory ness, What will it take to give up these ordinary common views and enter into Noble right view? What would convince you that anatta is real and can not be reborn? The Pali Cannon is not the infallible word of Buddha and is poorly teranslated? That it has been messed with by ordinary folks.

It boils down to the same thing: *Tell us what your price is. Where your line is drawn? Your conditions? What will it take to give up views?*

"I went in 55 minutes straight.
My biggest struggle was lowering my expectations of what was to come.
And I would say right around the last ten minutes I finally let go and let it all in.

Meaning I stoped trying so hard.
The whole time I could feel it.
My ego..thinking it could just try hard and get their. And that wasn't the case.

Once I stoped refusing to relax and and trying to navigate something or some space I truly don't know. I broke threw. But to what I'm not sure. The visuals weren't there. But this time I could feel something trying to heal me.
More specifically in my brain.
I could feel the vanes in my brain...
And they didn't feel damaged...I mean what would I know from my experiences.
But this time felt real like my energy was drawn to this point in my head and I felt like blood was finally circulating freely threw it and with a lot of power.

Here is a bit of my background on dmt before I finish...
I once met this lady when I broke threw under the blood moon this year.
It was a tragic week for me but I still decided to break threw ( I'm not the one to take a bad experience as bad their all just experiences) when I broke threw I was held by the most beautiful women warrior I've ever met. She was so beautiful I couldn't stand to look for more then a few seconds and incould tell she was a warrior but that explanation is for another time
...my little brain couldn't comprehend her, she closed my eyes and told me to relax and gave me all of the answers I ever needed up until that point. If you guys wanna know more I'll make a video and post it.

But the point being I've been receiving a deep love from something and I think it's her. Before my meditating ended tonight I felt my third eye Beginning to calm down and close and the vanes and space in my brain felt extremely clear, then I heard I love you. Now normally I have thoughts on top of thoughts in the beginning of my sessions. I'm a deep thinker and a quick one at that I also disassociate on a healthy level. So im aware of why and what I'm thinking and the tone and feeling. But this....This was another entitiy entirely and it felt like her...from my DMT trip, words escape me and I wish I could express this better but I know deep down she's been following me, 

PS side not : I stoped pulling tarot cards because I kept getting signs of her and my ex girlfriend popping up in the reading. I've literally pulled the same cards for weeks, and I'm not to good at there interpretation of them. So I finally gave in and up and couldn't handle the truth..which was hard to handle and frustrating because I didn't know how to reach the entity on the other side with out DMT or make amends with someone who we equally didn't want to see me as much as I didn't want to see her anymore....so those I began to search for healing and exploration to how we could meet and how I could forgive myself and ex girl. 
 And im shocked to say I'm not sure if life is much under our control even though we have choices that make us feel free I don't think we are to much free of how we really feel on the inside...only how we plan to get there..sorry if that sounds dark I just think freedom is 50% reality and the other 50 is something big the soul ... something I really need to get to know 

Thanks for reading ❤️🖤",0
"I really need to get this off my chest or my mind rather, it may seem silly, but for a long long time now. I've had a serious problem that has led to my self-help journey. This problem is a problem of not visual concentration because I have 20/20 vision, it is mental concentration. This may seem really ridiculous and it is to me as I write it out, but it's a mental problem of being unable to fully focus on an image as a whole like on a screen or a picture, drawing, art, etc. It started with anime for some reason, I guess it was something so foreign that I guess I couldn't understand it, I needed to know why they drew people or told stories the way they did. I needed to understand shapes and line work and the importance of that and what it means chemically, scientifically, culturally and other shit. Low and behold I realized I was just overthinking like an idiot. Discovered Sadhguru about overthinking and instantly stopped. I'm better now, but this for some reason has led me to search for something more for some reason, like I wanted to know the true meaning behind everything. I was and a little bit still am in fear of not enjoying things to their fullest, so in order to do that, I took things apart in order to find some info or evidence that would allow me to truly appreciate it in its highest form. I would focus on things like the shape of the hair, why is it so unorderly I guess, not fixed; in everything I did this. This problem came in stuff like animated movies, movies, and art in general. idk why, but i guess i needed to understand all to be all. Now I can't even focus on an image as a whole like in the present moment. It doesn't drive me nuts, but it empairs me fully enjoying something in the present. Sorry for a long story.",0
"hi, thanks for helping

1- how to forgive people who hurt you, been nasty (without any reason), bullied you

2-how to forgive life for being so unfair

3-how to forgive life for giving more to people who are 'bad', specifically people who has done bad stuff to me

4-how to forgive myself for a single past mistake, knowing that i am a perfectionist and really can't stand hurting anyone, or annoying them, etc.

a bit of background

concerning others: toxic household, bullied at school, rejected ALTHOUGH i was nice, modest, humble, physically well, , with an interesting life etc. teachers also unfair and nasty.

(for many reasons, my environment was bad and i didn't have an alternative for it)

concerning me: i uesd to be close with my mum and we'd argue. during the argument, she became cold and very distand, and it drove me crazy, which lead to bigger arguments. always felt guilty, didn't feel relieved until we made piece.

so i carry some guilt almost all the time. being bullied is a reason to this. i feel like i owe people something, i feel like i should please please etc.

i don't really care about people in my past, i hold no grudge against them but i definitely have an overall bitterness feeling. it affects how i interact with people currently.  it affects me as i feel i shouldn't be successful because people won't like me or will be threatened. i feel i shouldn't take care of myself because people won't like me. and it's true, when i used to be really smarter, more mature, than people of my age, and naturally gifted in many things (looks, money, voice, memory, academic abilities etc), i've NEVER had any appreciation except maybe a bit from my mum and a very few dear teachers. i was fought against, made fun of, people tried to bring me down, etc. so, i feel like if i let people be better than me, i get more peace of mind (it's true, believe it or not... until uni. at uni people changed and they ""like"" successful people who put effort in looks and studies and hobbies. but now it's too late, what's done is done and i feel like i want to be ""nobody"" so that i get no obstacles and hate and jealousy etc etc.

how can i get past everything i've been through? is there any way to forget everything related to past (especially knowing i have a very very good memory)?

second, i've done something quite awful during a long mental breakdown (not just months). a friend of mine, he hurt me, and i've done stuff in reaction to what he's done, that are not ethical. he doesn't know but if he did, he would be very hurt (understandable). i also feel i shouldn't be friends with him and shouldn't be cool and fun to be around with him because i'd be giving him a wrong insight about me . So yeah. not sure how to move forward. i think about it every single day. not sure how to be done with this. in addition to the guilt feeling i mentioned before, i now feel guilty because of this. it worsens the feeling that i don't deserve to be successful, pretty, etc etc.

any tip, advice, insight, similar experience is welcome.

p.s.: i always notice that ""good"", genuine people have a life that's shittiest than those who are not that good. it's not a coincidence, i'm talking about loads of people. anyone can explain ? :(",0

"Long story short, i had a lot of friends in middle school and was quite outgoing(still a quiet kid but i could at least make new friends and the majority of people liked me) . In high school we moved to a new town and i struggled to make friends there. I became very lonely throughout my high school career and lost my social skills. I am now in my senior year. Recently i have decided to work on getting over my social anxiety. I tried to be more fearless and be myself more. I've had good days but as soon as i start thinking about how well it is going, i immediately start overthinking and relapsing.

An old friend of mine and the only one i still have contact with said that his nieces friend needed a date for her prom. I decided to say yes because it could be a great opportunity to work om my social skills. Yesterday, me and thus girl went to go drink a coffee and get to know one another and it was really awkward. I just couldn't use the social skills that i have been working on for the past few months. I am so stressed now and i cant stop thinking about it and literally can't think about anything else besides how bad the date went and the fact that i have to go to prom with her on tuesday. I know this isn't evem so bad and that the logical thing to do would be to be more aware of these anxious thoughts and learn from them and from my mistakes i made during the date but i just cant escape the thought. Even ehen i was with my two friends today, i just sat there quietly because i could not enjoy myself in the moment as i usually do and kept thinking about that date. I have been having this knot feeling in my stomach that hasnt stopped. Even when i meditate, i cant stop thinking about it. I try to just observe the thought but i just cant.

"It’s really hard for me to let go of anger. I want vengeance. I want to get even. I want those who have hurt me to also hurt. I want people to get what they deserve. I have a lot of hate in my heart. 

I know this isn’t helpful. On paper I have a relatively easy time rationalizing it. I just can’t seem to believe it. I can tell it to myself but the feelings don’t dissipate. I can’t quite grasp the concept that if person A wrongs me for selfish reasons, that they are somehow worse off and I am somehow better off. Maybe in the long run. But I feel like I need to justify it. 

I have used pain a lot to better myself. Every time I was hurt I would try and do something productive or successful to be better and drive forward. Then I got good at it. I would sometimes intentionally hurt myself since it provided a lot of fuel. Eventually I burnt out. But I’m realizing the hate is still there.

I've been going through some tough emotions lately, and although my normal breath focused meditation is helping directly somewhat, I think it potentially will help me more by making me realize how low my self-confidence is.  I've always been aware of my low self confidence, but I'm now becoming more aware of how it brings me to these negative emotional states in the first place.

Anyway, I'm looking for recommendations of some of your favorite loving kindness guided meditations with a focus on being kinder and more loving to yourself.

I've done a few loving kindness meditations in the past, but I think I would really benefit from adding one to my daily meditations.

Any recommendations will be greatly appreciated!  I hope you all can view the world just as it is today, and take solace in your own internal calm. 

I don't post very often in general, I'm mostly just a lurker, but I'd like to take this moment to thank this group for existing. It has helped, and continues to help me on my path, and I am eternally grateful for that.  Thank you 
r/meditation.  From the bottom of my heart ❤️.",0
"For those who tried the basic sessions in Headspace, there is always a part the app tells you to let your mind do whatever he wants around 7 or 8 minutes. Anyone has any thoughts about that?

"My last session shared no comparison to tonight's session.
I proceeded like I will from now on
 With Binureal beats.
Which prove to be the new diving board for my energy.

I went in with a new mantra.
I am one with the universe.

And boy I wish I could really tell you In full detail but most words escape me. It all kind of happened at once. Beautiful colors and spaces within spaces. They only lasted a few moments. 
My heart knew I wasn't ready to go completely all of the way. Though my ego was pushing really hard with each heart beat that thumped I grew closer but I still harbor feelings against people I don't want to carry with me to where ever my spirit is breaking threw too

I have a history of anger and I can hold a grudge like an elephant.
So instead of going all of the way my instinct put on the breaks. My mind set believes I don't hold the pieces of peace yet but now that I have seen.. I know what's up..and I know what I have to do. 
And I'm going to have a burning session soon to free up what ever I can't reach like a deep tissue ache in my muscles that needs a professional. I just want to be safe so I can do what I came to do with no more distractions 😉

"Hi! We’re often told to observe our breath as a means of anchoring. But when I try this I think I always - always - instantly start controlling my breathing. I’m not sure it’s ever felt like I’m observing it in the way I hear a sound, or how we try to observe thought (not great at that either.)

"“Sitting meditation is not, as is often supposed, a spiritual ‘exercise’, a practice followed for some ulterior object. From a Buddhist standpoint, it is simply the proper way to sit, and it seems perfectly natural to remain sitting so long as there is nothing else to be done, and so long as one is not consumed with nervous agitation. To the restless temperament of the West, sitting meditation may seem to be an unpleasant discipline, because we do not seem to be able to sit ‘just to sit’ without qualms of conscience, without feeling that we ought to be doing something more important to justify our existence. To propitiate this restless conscience, sitting meditation must therefore be regarded as an exercise, a discipline with an ulterior motive. Yet in the Buddhist sense, for where there is purpose, where there is seeking and grasping for results, there is no dhyana (Zen)” - Alan Watts :)",0
"I feel like meditation is a waste ... in order to do it right you have to dedicate years of practice, hours a day like buddhist monks.  Meanwhile for most people it is a pretentious bourgeois pose.

"For years I've adopted the common practice of ""catching"" myself thinking into the past or the future; utilizing the idea that time is a mind-derived concept. I wanted to create a visualization that could act as a reminder to help bring me back to the present moment, so I started to visualize a book. The left side of the book would designate the past while the right side of the book would represent the future. Ideally, I would exist at the binding of the book or at a single word of a page; this acting as the present moment.

As I held this visualization, it dawned on me that this representation may actually cause an identification with time. I'm saying ""I recognize past and future don't exist"" but at the same time creating its existence by visual representation. This realization created a shift in my perception; by viewing time as linear in this way, I hadn't fully let go of the hold time had on my life.

I'm finding it hard to put into words, but in meditative practice it may feel something like this:

* *""I've caught myself anxious about the future, therefor I will bring myself back to the present moment""*

vs.

* *""I've caught my mind perceiving the concept of future. I recognize this is an illusion of the mind and I accept that this present moment is all that exists""*

This was a meaningful shift to me so I'm hoping it may provide value to others. If anyone can elaborate on this idea I would love to hear it!",0

"Hello!

I've been meditating here and there for the past month. I hadn't noticed much of a difference in my mindset so I decided to take a more disciplined approach and make it a daily practice. I've meditated every day this week and the past two days ran into an interesting problem I didn't anticipate.

How the hell do you meditate when you just don't want to?

I power through the impulse saying ""To hell with it. Go make some coffee."" I set a timer. I lie down. I breathe. I try not to try too hard and just allow it to happen. Then the timer goes off yet I never quite got into the zone.

I learned that consistency is of the utmost importance when building a new habit two years ago when I got back into working out. Even when I really didn't want to do anything physical at all I still tried. Twenty push ups are better than zero push ups. Beyond building the habit there was definite benefit in just the attempt itself.

Aside from building or maintaining the habit, do you find benefit in the mere attempt at meditation? How does it feel to simply go through the motions?",0

"Hello. Does anyone have the same problem as me? When I graduated from high school, I started to take meditation seriously. I felt some of the greatest joys and stillness during that period of my life. I remember going for walks at 11pm during winter and immersing myself in what seemed to be a distant world. However, when I started to work, take classes, and worry about what I would do with my life (parents would remind me that I have to make my own life), I stopped meditating. I recently realized why I stopped. When I meditate, my mind feels free and untethered. However, my mind eventually remembers the work, the school, the crossroads that I'm at as an adult and all of my social anxieties. I realized that that process of ""coming back"" to reality after meditation is painful. I know that the original Pali Canon recommended people into meditation to live a life in seclusion and in nature and I want to do that, but I live near D.C. in an urbanized area. For those like me, what do you do? I wish that there were more natural spaces scattered throughout my community to sit in.",0

"Hello all,

Recently I’ve been probing into meditation and I wanted to get advice on an experience I’ve been having. I’ve been trying to do some mindfulness meditation every once and a while when I need to walk an appreciable distance in my day to day life. When I try to just listen to my sensory perceptions, however, I can get into this trance like state that feels rather lonely and disturbing. It is a rather difficult emotional experience to explain but I’ll do my best to draw a picture. When I try to just notice sounds, sights, smells, etc. for what they are, i can’t help but feel like reality is, for lack of a better word, naked. I think it’s a similar feeling that would occur if one were to watch an animal body decompose or watch hundreds of insect larvae hatch from a breeding ground - this kind of detached observation of something vulgar, intensely interested in itself, and just inevitably sort of there. I know I probably already sound very pretentious, but I’ll risk sounding even more so by saying that the “thereness” of the world overwhelms me, leaving me feel both totally isolated as an observer of things and in a trance because of how inescapable this all feels. It’s like being stuck in a bad situation for too long, even if you struggled at the beginning eventually you just accept the place you’re in with a detached, unpleasant indifference. 

Certainly I can see someone telling me that it isn’t reality saying these things to me, but what I with my preconceptions on existence (ie that it’s vulgar, overwhelming, etc) am saying to myself, but I can’t seem to help it; as much as I try to unravel the thread further, there doesn’t seem to be a level of experience beyond this kind of state where things do nothing but nakedly exist. 

Is there any sort of mental space I should try to get myself into before I try mindfulness, or anything I may be doing wrong? Because listening to the world as I know how to do clearly doesn’t work. I’ve heard that meditative practices often try to transcend one’s sense of self for pure presence in the moment - based on my (admittedly few) experiences, that sounds really dreadful to me, and I can’t conceptualize a way in which that would be something worth working towards.",0
"So I normally don't share my experience. I have a I firm belief what we go threw can be often individual. But I'm learning slowly otherwise to still try and share.

I have been practicing meditating for over five or six years now. Slowly picking up the pace as time passed and life became more difficult 💔. 

I normally had a basic time. Especially over the past three years. Ya know how it goes. You learn to let go and build on yourself.
It's all been a blast, tones of tears plenty of smiles and a few cries that I never knew my heart was holding on too. Dad issues bad relationships and what ever I neglected along the way. I've also grown adept to my own energy 

But I've come to the big punch.
My anger, and lack of love. 

Now  to give you a hint most of my relationships friendship or love ship. Have been heavley karmic, and it finally dawned on me I'm the oldest male still around in my family ( grandfather dead. Dad miss placed, uncle is to far gone in his brain due to drugs to know what's up from down) I'm the one people come to for a lot. It's no burden though. But I started to notice the lack of true significant others ( love ) in my family's lineage. Now I've over looked this several times...until today. 
a lot of pieces fell together kind of all at once like when you don't know the answer to a question on a test so you skip it and your forced to come back because you want a 100% on this thing we call life.. 

to not lose your attention I'll wrap this up quick and simple . I decided to ask myself and what ever good spirits that follow my life and my family's life what's the deal with my anger why does my family struggle with love, I mean it's deep man real deep, and it's even deeper for the woman in my family, mom divorced two and the third died of a heart attack at a really early age. Dude was an athlete who's family had no prior history just to give you a taste. Me my luck's been a bit better but to no avail still kinda the same just no actual death

So I said screw it I need to know.
And with deep affirmation I dove deep.
Now I'm able to meditate for about an hour before my (will) realizes we have other stuff to do, so here is the best part... 
I asked the same question over and over again why am I angry.. I need the answer was always the under thought as well ..not want or please.. simply keeping the vibe I know the answer is here some where.

I was basically on the hunt for the White rabbit in my life that always got away. And with a steady fast heart Im sure I came into contact with something epic. 
While pushing my energy to poor from my body...which was kinda foolish with out the right protection I might add I eventually was pushed from the right side of my body.

Now I know the difference between your body flinching during meditation and being pushed.

The only problem is I didn't have time to retrain my focus.. remember I'm only adept to this.

The next stage was quick I felt warm and all of my energy I had been collecting around my body swopped away super quick.
Now normally I get super warm at the beginning of my meditating which makes sense to me because I'm coming into focus.
I eventually normalize and get used to the heat. 

Not knowing how to handle it I called for friends and family living and none living to help aid in a quick recovery so I could bounce back and chase what ever had done this to me  so it could do not do it again. Because it didn't feel right or justified..
I came to the conclusion a true friendly entity comes in peace not but force. It's smooth and consenting like a puzzle piece that most go to it's place by design.

After a some what of a quick recovery from imagery and breathing techniques brought threw a thought cycle I was normalized again and feeling my flow. 

I hauleted my rage for I am not the one to be pushed.
And thought back to what I was thinking before this had occurred..ya k ow action reaction things don't happen for no real reason in my life 

I remember thinking I would die to help my family figure this out I would give up myself to know what I can do to help my family and ancestors be stronger for the past and Future *and that's when it came*

So with a good eye on what I wanted I restrained myself from over reacting.
I've heard succubus will just consume more energy from you if you keep trying to dish out to attack, ive heard from others that they had to change the emotions of the attack to throw them off to do real damage..but I wanted to not fight with rage just peace.
 
I've learned from the repercussions of war with real people and I can only imagine what it's like to fight on an astral plane. The spiritual suffering after has to be insane.

So I always assure in this mantra of peace
( I do not wish to make energy to harm damage or cause pain, if you stay you will be transformed by my love and will to live)


I know what it's like to hunger threw anger and other negative emotions. 

So I'd rather not hurt anything that's just trying to survive. 
And it worked I slowly came back to full intense body vibe and flow and after a swift check of my surroundings I kept hearing small sounds all over my room I never hear much before while meditating. But this time was different it was my first time trying binureal beats 
Now normally I can pick up on this stuff because I'm not wearing headphones , it's ether the (A/C or my cat) and it definitely wasn't the A/C Becuase I couldn't hear or feel it and I had not heard my cat actually messing around 
...in fact he came back into the room about two minutes after I was done
And my cats a dick when he wants to be childish he goes all out..now me and my cat are super close and cool like we talk to each other. Even though it's just a bunch of loud meows and me just asking simple obvious questions he only does it primarily with me, so it's comforting to so the least. I came to the conclusion what ever it was had to be messing with the posters on my Walls...I have a bunch that aren't properly taped down. 

This may sound insane I know ..so I did hesitate to share and I'm really glad you read this. I'm going to have to make some  protective moves from here on out so I don't end up like Alice I wonderland and I'll let you guys know how my family's anger works out from here.

I have a feeling it's only just getting started.",0
"While I’m on my second 5 minute meditation I see blue orbs/disc getting smaller, and getting larger as time goes.

"I direct my attention to a particular muscle (I feel slight tingles), and subsequently when I consciously relax that muscle (heavy tingles).

"I’ve been meditating daily for the past 2 months now. I use Headspace as my meditation app of choice. A month ago I went through a breakup and I’ve been heartbroken ever since and I find meditation very helpful. 

Ever since the breakup, I started meditating even more, a minimum of 2 to 5 times daily instead of once everyday when I started out. It definitely helps me with thoughts about my relationship. 

Though, only recently that I started feeling my heartbeat. It’s the same kind of feeling you would feel while going on a run or while you’re nervous. 

At first, I thought that it was because of the breakup, because when I close my eyes, I start to feel it. I tried putting my hand on my chest but I don’t feel anything. It’s weird because I thought my heart beats faster just like when I run, you know when you run and your heart beats fast, you can feel it with your hand. In my chest, I feel like it goes faster but I don’t feel anything with my hand. 

I wonder if anyone feels this also. I also would like to mention that I feel so much calmer after meditating, it puts me in a very calm enjoyable state. I don’t know if that’s the reason behind it, meaning I’m just more in tune with my body.",0

"Anyone’s rumination and intrusive thinking worse on CBD because it causes lack of motivation and discipline?!

I’ve been taking 15 mg full spectrum CBD oil capsules (with low THC) 1-2/day. I’ve noticed it calms my PTSD startle responses in public but it also makes me become more apathetic, unmotivated, and lazier. I notice I have less discipline to practice meditation and stop myself from ruminating and thinking of intrusive thoughts. My mind keeps resisting the CBD calmness and I keep ruminating non stop. This is my second day of migraines and I think it’s because of the nonstop ruminating. I think the CBD is making this worse. I also wonder if my mind is ruminating even more with cbd because it is not used to the calmness and is trying to cause mental distress to go back to that fight or flight State I am used to as a form of self sabotage (I keep thinking about distressing memories). I also notice CBD oil makes it harder for me to process my emotions as it has a numbing effect. Maybe I am taking too much?",0

"my alarm goes off and I immediately sit up take my meditation pillow place it under my butt and focus on breath for half an hour. 

This morning I wake up and to my pleasure I find that both nostrils are functioning perfectly! Wonderful!

Within moments after sitting up, my nose starts running and then I start sneezing uncontrollably for at least a couple minutes. Reset the timer.

I will not waiver. Taking a small piece of tissue paper I push it up one nostril, apparently the sinuses decided it's  time to drain the swamp,  and each time I need to breathe in I pull out that other nostril  with my fingers.

I refused to succumb!

And after all this it  turns out to be a pretty good meditation after all. I have a steak deal of nearly 90 days 😊",0
"The only thing I've found that helps is taking deeper breaths for the first half of my sit then slowing down progressively until it seems like I'm hardly breathing at all and my mind seems to get more still as well.
Also should I restrict my thoughts or just let them flow or a mix of both?
Thanks guys",0
"Before the interview, I was waiting at ths lobby and felt nervous, but decided to pay mindful attention to the surroundings and notice the people coming to work instead, and anxiety subsided.

Although, when I got called in to do a written test as the first stage of the interview, I kind got lost in thought when planning and writing the essay, and barely made the time limit. 

This leads me to the question: what does being mindful in the context of doing a writing task or task that involves thinking mean? If you become so absorbed in the task that you lose track/awareness of the physical surroundings, is that comsidered as being mindful? Are you supposed to become ""swallowed up"" by the task? To illustrate, I am typimg this on the train, and while typing this I was not aware of the passing of stops, and before I knew it it was my stop. Does mindfulness mean being aware of how the train is stopping at every station while I type this, or does mindfulness include being so absorbed in a task until you block out everything else?

EDIT: I guess the gist of it is: if you focus completely on doing one thing to the extent of blocking out everything else, such as typing this post on my phone while on the train, to the extemt that I was not aware of the passing of stops - does that count as being mindful?",0
"The title is a more ""pretty"" way of saying that when I meditate I will eventually hit a point where there's a sensation in my finger tips. Usually a bit of tingle but not like when it's falling asleep. More time and concentration and then my hands feel the same way and soon enough it feels like they're not even there at all, but also that they could be anywhere at the same time. This feeling starts to envelope my body from my spine and can sometimes feel frightening, but also very warm and comforting. Then I'm left sitting there with what feels like no body just watching my thoughts roll by. Some of which can be a bit anxious, and I can sometimes feed into them but I do my best to accept and welcome them and back into this weird void I go. And I enjoy it. It's something magically relaxing and somewhat idk emotional or informational? Idk if this is something that is supposed to happen or if other people feel this as well but I just wanted to share my experience with everyone. Because honestly it feels amazing. And terrifying. But beautiful lol. 

Hope everyone has an amazing day!",0
"Yesterday I went to a local Buddhist meditation group after a few months of not attending. I have been struggling a bit mentally, and decided to go as I didn't have that much going on. Honestly it was more for the community aspect than the teachings. Everyone there has at least 30 years on me, so I get a cool perspective.

Anyway after the meditation when I open my eyes my ears started ringing very loudly and my vision fogged up. It was similar to a head rush (I get them a lot) but I was sitting down the whole time. I had just drank 2 glasses of water so I knew it wasn't dehydration. It didn't come with any alternative thoughts or feelings that stood out, which has happened to me with before. The ear ringing was extremely loud, louder than everyone in the room. I've also been having a ton of ear ringing in general. 

I went over to my friends house after the and gave his mom a hug. She said ""You are sad, why are you sad?""

I sorta just laughed it off and said ""I didn't know I was sad."" I had a dream a while back where my girlfriend told me that I have a big ball of sadness, and this reminded me of it. But compared to how my mood has been the past few weeks I was in a good mood. 

Anyway that is just some background information, my main reason for posting this is to get some different opinions on this ringing and dizziness. I don't know what to think of it. Thanks",0

&amp;#x200B;

*“Prem” is a Hindi word which means “Love” and the meaning of “ Nida “ is Nest. So,* ***Osho Prem Nida****is like a nest that nurtures love &amp;joy, nourishes the soul &amp; rejuvenates the body.*  *It is a place of* divine potential for sentient experience, ultimate happiness, and deep contentment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Location** \- 

 Osho Prem Nida, an ashram in the lap of nature, is located in the village Daluwala within limits of Rajaji Nation Park between Roorkee &amp; Haridwar ( Uttrakhand). Amidst the greenery &amp; jungle, the ashram is spread over 32 acres.OshoPremNida was inaugurated on 25 July 2010 on the day of Gurupurnima and the wilderness of nature has been preserved while designing the ashram.

&amp;#x200B;

**Natural Beauty-**

The ashram is surrounded by Shivalik ranges. The serene environment of the ashram has calmness of the trees, the fragrance of flowers, chirping of birds and whistling winds. During clear nights its seems that stars are bestowing all their coolness on the Ashram. Proximity to Ganga also provides a lot of spiritual energy which helps in meditation energizing mind and body. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Nature heals and soothes-**

  

Being in nature reduces anger, fear, depression, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only provides better emotional strength, but it also contributes to the physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones. In the long run, it reduces mortality.

***""Nature is fuel for the soul, ""*** says Richard Ryan

&amp;#x200B;

**Meditation in Nature -** 

 The abundance of positive energy in nature removes negativity from the mind &amp; body. The awareness of natural beauty is a step towards egolessness.  Raw greenery, Bamboo trees, wildflowers bring the calmness of thoughts and revitalizes the body- such undisturbed wilderness makes it a perfect getaway for mystical experiences.

Meditating in nature is not just good for mind, body &amp; soul it is also good for plants &amp; animals. They are more healthy and peaceful. 

It has been experienced by Mahavir- “***By meditating in nature we connect, pray and communicate with trees , plants, animals, birds, crystal &amp; water, etc.”***

The proximity of the river Ganga also brings divine effect. The sound of water also has a tranquilizing effect on the mind. Ganga has been considered sacred for the very simple reason that the meditation has been done by many saints on the banks of this holy river. The water gets energized due to the power of meditation and drinking that water makes us peaceful.

Water molecules react differently on being exposed to positive or negative thoughts, so we can appreciate the fact that as our bodies are 70% water our thoughts and emotion will play a big role in our health and wellbeing.",0
"I’ve been trying to practice meditation, and I’m finding it to be extremely frustrating as opposed to calming. I try to focus on something such as my breathing and to just allow thoughts to enter and leave without paying much attention, but my mind just becomes agitated and unable to focus. It feels impossible for me to make any progress, and if anything, my failing to do so just  increase negative feelings. I’m not doing this to find or obtain anything, just to sit and breathe and be present, but I cannot for the life of me practice anything remotely close to that. 

I deal with a lot of anxiety and irritability, so I could certainly benefit from the practice, but it feels like I don’t have the capability to do so, which only serves to amplify the anxiety/irritability. I usually feel worse after trying to meditate than before.",0

"Hello. I consider myself very lucky to live near the beach. I try my best to walk on the beach to observe, listen, meditate and stretch a few times a week. Lately I’ve been pausing and watching more particularly at sunset or early in the morning calm. I started recording the landscapes to watch and listen to them in my free time. They help me relax during breaks at work or go to sleep. It’s simple, I just capture the stillness of the moment and the waves/ landscape are perfect white noise to ease the mind. I put the videos online, don’t think it’s for everyone - but maybe it’ll help y’all find stillness.

"After attending a TM course I've been doing it for more than a month and so far my life has improved in more ways than one. I realise I might have achieved it with a different, cheaper to learn technique but as a newbie to serious meditation I'm satisfied with it anyway.

In recent months I got familar with more types of meditation through the internet and friends alike. They all seem interesting and benefitial in some way so I would like to try them in the future at some point.

How would I go about trying them some time later not to abandon TM? I know i can't propably do more than one at the same time but would it be ok If I changed it up for Vipassana or Mindfullness for at least a moth so I could at least check what these techniques are about?",0
"Recently I’ve been going through a life transition (aren’t we always???) and have fallen out of my meditation practice when I’ve needed it the most. I’ve been trying to get back into it, but the mental noise has been so opaque that I can’t focus on my breath for more than five seconds without getting distracted. I used to be able to go 20 minutes or so in a state of meditation, now that seems insurmountable. Any advice on how to get back into my mindfulness practice?",0
"Hey all,

I'm new to meditation practice (a few weeks), but I have been meditating most evenings before bed and have been able to really reach a meditative state for at least part of the meditation. It's a pretty awesome feeling and im keen to continue and build on my practice. 

Last night I listened to a guided healing mediation by Michael Sealey on YouTube. I listened to it with headphones in, because my partner was sleeping next to me and didn't feel like meditating. I fell asleep before the meditation ended. 

I had the most intense, visual dream of my ex boyfriend. We dated for 5 years, from age 19-24 (relevant). In my dream we were reconnecting and talking about what has happened in each other's life since we broke up. We hugged very intensely and I told him about my life. It was amiable.  Note that I have zero contact with my ex, he lives across the country now and we don't have each other on social media. 

While my current partner is at work he texts me ""I had a really weird dream about your ex boyfriend. I was having visions of you except younger, with black hair and kinda emo. You guys were hugging and I felt sad and jealous in the dream"". It's true that I did look ""kind of emo"" in my early 20s (and had black hair), and he hasn't seen many pictures of me from that time. 

I have to note that my current partner and I live in Ontario, and I grew up in Alberta (where my ex lives). There's zero chance that my partner has seen photos of my ex or has mutual friends etc. He's not someone I talk about a lot so it is random for him to have a dream of him. 

Is this a phenomenon that anyone is familiar with?  

I never forgave my ex for a lot of things that he did to me (infidelity, lying, manipulation).  I feel that my repressed subconscious wants me to forgive him. Tips? Thoughts? Opinions? Have you experienced something similar?",0
How do you end your meditations? I've been meditating for about a month and find that I get particularly anxious about meditating beyond the time I've set aside. Using a standard timer is harsh and quite unpleasant but I need some way of trusting that I'm going to reengage with the world at am appropriate time. Suggestions?,0
So right now I meditate 25 minutes in the morning and 25 before bed.  My dilemma is that I’m not very consistent meditating in the evening.  Would meditating 50 minutes in the morning be better if it means I’m more consistent? And would jumping from 25 minutes to 50 minutes be too much?,0
"Since I meditated yesterday I see a massive crack over my vision  that consist of colors that change rapidly, when I focus on it it just goes a bit more to the left and shortly after focusing it goes back to the middle. It's fascinating but really annoying. I can't really see what I am writing because that crack is going over the letters I am typing. It just appeared 14 hours after meditating while I was on my phone.",0

"Hello /r/meditation,

I'm looking for guided imagery or other meditative practice that would focus on cultivating and experiencing an emotion.

I know an example of such guided imagery where you have a trigger that would make you build the emotion up, and then you let it go as soon as the trigger is no more there.

I would love to learn about similar techniques if anybody can advise on it",0

"I’ve been trying to meditate on and off for around two years, never getting further than a streak of a week or two of daily practice. I’m currently using the Headspace app, even though I find the narrator’s voice unpleasant, because at least it’s very simple.  
 
Everything I read and hear about meditation seems to say the easiest place to start is to focus on your breathing. I don’t under how to do this, though. I can’t focus on something with no words. As in, if I’m trying to put my focus onto my breathing, or for that matter instrumental music or something visual, my inner monologue is still running. Not always in a bad way, but obviously it’s not great when trying to meditate. The Headspace instructions talk about “observing your thoughts and letting them go” but although I can consciously think “that was a thought, I don’t need to dwell on it,” my brain moves on to a different thought, rather than to even a second of wordlessness. I don’t know how my brain can even exist without words to be honest - there isn’t a second of my life where words aren’t going through my mind. 

I’m not spiritual, so mantras don’t appeal to me (I’m also not a fan of affirmations), and have quite bad anxiety; the aim is to get to a point where I don’t overthink so much and can more easily distance myself from what I worry about.",0
"Hi guys, I am going to start going on the path of enlightenment. I just need to ask a few questions before I get started. 

I have ADHD, would that make meditation more harder for me? 

Does being on medication for ADHD like adderall bad or good for your path of enlightenment? 

Do you breath in through your nose and out of your mouth?

I have hearing aids, so when I'm not wearing them I can barely like hear anything. So I was wondering if I should meditate in silence or do it while listening to meditation musics?

I'm also wondering if there is any other sites or music that can help me tune into the universal energies more and more. 

And one last thing, I used to smoke weed daily but now its occasionally. Does weed messes up your enlightenment? And is it okay to meditate when you're high?

Thank you, any help is greatly appreciated.

Im also going to meditate while lying down since I find it more comfortable.",0
"I had a really rough day today. Don't need to get into it but work was a bitch and my personal life threw a curveball at me.

I got home feeling angry and frustrated, and normally my go-to stress reliever is weed (see username) but instead I decided to take a different approach.

Now I'm no stranger to meditation, and I actually try and do it every day, and have been for a decent chunk of time now. But I've only recently actually tried to apply the Wim Hof breathing method into my arsenal as well. Never tried the cold shower part before though.

I tried the cold shower today, and let me tell you it was the greatest damn shower I've ever taken. I hate the cold. I suck it up because there's no reason to complain about it, but I still hate it.

For me to be able to step into a freezing cold shower and go from ""OHMYGODTHISFUCKINGSUCKS"" to ""you know, I like this a lot"" in less than 30 seconds is nothing short of a miracle. I finished my shower and stepped out feeling like a new man. 

I can't believe how long it has taken me to finally try this, but now I'm going to do everything I can to incorporate the shower into my daily routine as well. I feel as good and confident now as I really ever do, not to mention the health benefits associated with taking colder showers. 

TL;DR - Cold shower made me happy instead of more angry.",0

"Hi everyone!

I have dabbled on and off over the years with meditation and recently I have found new level of awareness and commitment to the practice.  (for me it's been the app headspace that's helped tremendously, something about it just clicks for me)

I am on a one week streak and want to keep at it.  But one thing derails me a little bit at times.... My cats.  I love them so much! They've been a great help in the past when struggling with depression.  They're always there to rub against me, fwop on my lap, one even drools when I give him big pets.  

I recently realized they're a great practice in being mindful, they bring my awareness to the moment and help keep my mind clear when distracted with anxious thoughts.  However, sometimes when meditating, they become the distraction.  I do my best to include their presence as a part of my meditation (being aware of my surroundings) .  But there are days when I just don't want to be physically disturbed when meditating.  These cats are very Codependent, and when given the opportunity to lay on my lap, they take it. 

I am still in the swing of things of relearning awareness, letting thoughts pass, letting go of distraction.  I have tried isolating myself in my bedroom... But they scratch at the door and meow for me to let them in.  Often my only solution is to give in to their needs, give them the attention they seek, and wait for them to calm down and nap next to me. I do this so I feel as though I will be free to meditate with minimal disturbances.  The time I spend with them beforehand is used as practice to be mindful, and help calm my often racing mind. I have had success with this, but it can sometimes feel as a time sink, and I am struggling with not letting these thoughts become obsessive. 

Have anyone else here shared similar experiences with pets? How have you coped with the extra distraction of your beloved partners? I would love to get some extra insight on the topic.",0
"I’ve been doing meditation on and off for the past 2 years. Today during my practice I found a very entertaining way to stay focused on the breath.

I would picture myself sitting in the center of the universe, then as I breathed in I watched all of the stars and planets get sucked into my body. After this, all I could see was white. I would hold the universe in my lungs for a bit, then exhale and watch the planets &amp; stars come shooting back out. I would take a second to look around the beautiful universe I created and was apart of, then inhale again. 

Over and over I watched the destruction and construction of my own solar system as I breathed in and out. 

It really made me feel at peace &amp; made me feel as if I were really outside of the entire universe. I was there alone with just my body and breath, quite an amazing feeling :) 

Let me know what you guys do/if you found this helpful! Have a good day &amp; stay mindful!",0

"I have a problem. Most times, when i focus on my breath, i have the same problem. I see but mostly hear things, in basiclly the same way as in dreams. They are very random, and i am not thinking activly. When i have them i have to options:
1.Observe them and see where they are going. This has allways resultet with me falling asleep
2. Focus very hard on my breath. This feels like waking up, but it only lasts around 5 sekunds, before those ""thoughts"" return. This also very exhausting since it is just like fighting falling asleep, even if it is alot slower, compared to times where i am just tired.

I know the solution is easy: just keep my eyes open.
But i really enjoy meditating with my eyes closed.(when i don't have these thoughts)

So that is why i am asking you, if you have had any similar experiences or maybe even know what i am talking about.
Or if you don't, i would really appreaciate it, if you could share your experiences. Or if you would advise me to keep on ""fighting"" those ""thoughts"" or if i should follow them, to maybe find there roots.

Also: I get enough sleep(around 7.30-9h) each night. But i do feel tired quite often.

Thank you in advance.",0
"[Correct vs Incorrect posture](https://i.imgur.com/avf9M8m.jpg)

&gt;""The posture without excessive lordosis (right picture) is indeed healthier for the spine...less prone long-term to disc herniation and other issues. But in terms of zazen, someone sitting with pelvis tilted and back curved as in the left photo cannot breathe deeply at all...the diaphragm cannot move freely and fully. This means that the method of breath cultivation that is foundational in Rinzai practice, and upon which cultivation of profound samadhi and the ability to bodily work with practice methods like koan/wato depends, will be impossible.""  ~Roshi Meido Moore

Of course that is from a Rinzai zen perspective, but the physical effects with a posture like that are universal. The diaphragm will not move freely and you will wind up with a sore back or worse. 

Some people like to claim posture isn't important. Well, it is important if you don't want back pain!",0

"I was meditating during my train ride when I realized something that I'd consider very important. You need white to have black and you need black to have white. A white painting on a white background is just white and not a painting, just like a black painting on a black background is just black and not a painting. To have a painting you need at least both of those.

I've noticed during the my meditation on my train ride that my awareness is the same. When I focus on something I also focus on nothing. It's paradoxical, but it's the way my awareness works. Focus on one thing and you'll find yourself focusing on nothing. Focus on nothing and you'll find yourself focusing on something. If I try to focus on something it won't work, it seems that I either have to jump to something else or nothing at all. The same happens when I try to focus on nothing, it doesn't work. I jump back to something. But interestingly enough if I start observing both my focus on something and nothing I can maintain it. 

So what does this teach me? Perhaps that it's impossible to ever focus on only emptiness itself? Perhaps it's impossible to ever focus on only something? Perhaps I should try focusing on something and at the same on nothing at all, doing the illogical and paradoxical.",0
"Stillness is defined by a lack of movement. What is calm and still in nature moves slowly or not at all, with a vastness and consistency that humbles as much as it inspires. I look at the stolid dependability of a tree or a boulder and remember that we have much to learn about life from these objects that we write off as lifeless.

As soon as you begin to focus on an object with a certain benign indifference, you’ll find life in it. Everything is charged with some sort of energy. I don’t mean this in a hippie dippie acid dream sense, but instead in a simple perceptual sense. The energy of a given external stimulus is determined by how you judge it. If you train your attention to be neutral, you uncover unforeseen opportunities and begin to see nuances.

Meditation practice challenges us to find this stillness. By willfully exposing ourselves to a lack of movement, we grant ourselves permission to tune into the spontaneous stillness of nature. Finding the stillness is much like zoning in to a special frequency. Most of the time we’re tuned to a loud and chaotic frequency full of ambitions, desires, judgments and anxieties, but a frequency of meditative stillness exists pervasively beneath all of this. Like darkness, it precedes light. It floats under what we perceive to be reality, and as a result it often reflects deeper truths than what we see on the surface.

My mind always tries to throw off the stillness. This is the specialty of the human; it arrogantly and naively attempts to assert its own subjectivity on an objective and uncaring whole. Nature is the substructure, human projection the superstructure. We build an artificial reality on top of a natural reality that already exists, and thus over time the layers thicken and we become less aware of true reality. Meditation is a truly revelatory act in these times; it helps us slowly return to these natural depths and contemplate what true being is. This is a practice that society as a whole has long forgotten. Reviving it is key to our survival and humility as a species.

"Let me just start by saying I stopped consuming the news a long time ago and am no longer personally on social media, but sometimes certain news stories make it back to me. Sometimes I can't help reading more when something really strikes fear in me but that's rare. When it does happen though, I'm literally unable to take myself out of swimming in those icky feelings for an uncomfortable amount of time.

When I hear something disturbing or depressing it can make me feel super down for hours to days in a way that many of my ""local"" thoughts don't. Especially things that evoke fear (like mass shootings) or  or something just depressing (like the opioid epidemic) or gross excerpts (like reading about an incel who tweeted an extremely sexually derogatory thing about women) - all these tend to make me fearful of the world or wary about other people. The latter is a stronger emotion. It does make the world seem like a truly dark and gross place for a while.

I try to distract myself, if I have the time, by watching/reading about good people and positive things in the world. It doesn't necessarily work. These thoughts in particular are really sticky and take a long time to unstick. While I'm trying to unstick from these thoughts, or if i don't have the time and have to power through a task, my day takes on a totally different mood. I'm aware of what's happening, but I can't see it and disengage with it as I can with other thoughts. These thoughts make me fearful of the people that are around since, for some unfounded reason, I never thought people like the people in the news actually existed before the internet/social media really took over. I'm not saying I'm perfect, just that I am perhaps naive and sheltered, but learning about negative reality doesn't make me happier *or*, more importantly, more effective at helping.

I've been meditating 2-3x for 2 years and it's still something I can't seem to  be fully aware of, or have the choice to disengage with. What can I do to deal with this?",0

"It has been 24 days since I broke up with my ex. It has been hard for me. After a meditation session today, I began to feel a deep sadness in my heart. I realized that it was more than I had been feeling before this. I realized that instead of slowing down to properly feel my emotions, I was going fast and distracting myself with everything I could after the breakup.

Now, more than three weeks after, it all released. I was on a walk when, stemming from the sadness I was feeling, sobs began to overcome me. It was the first time I truly felt the grief of loss after I broke up with her... So I let myself cry. I let it all out. I didn't hold back. Waves of emotion passed through me, and I cried hard. I sat there and felt it all.

After that, I felt a little bit better. I can only hope that this experience and hardship will one day have me coming out the other end a stronger person. It's amazing how meditation can allow us to look into ourselves and release what needs to be released. Because in order to move on, you have to feel all the emotions you want to avoid.

Just wanted to share my experience. Thanks for reading.",0

So I've been meditating for some time and have been doing it in various ways. Now as I'm learning about posture and my goal is to train myself to sit in a seated meditation for hours on end without having a hard time physically.

With that, I have a very reliable sign and meter for my mental well being - if I meditate enough, I can be almost relaxed; if I don't, things get tense and painful.

Now for my question: After about 15 minutes there often is a moment when I forget to watch my breath and thoughts and get swept away in some daydream. When this happens, it is accompanied by a peaceful feeling, a calm mind (not empty though) and a noticeable relaxation of the muscles.

I enjoy this a lot. But isn't this kinda the opposite of what we are trying to achieve when focusing on the breath and letting thoughts pass in order to have fewer of them?

In the first 10 minutes I would actively recognize upcoming thoughts, label them, return to my breath. While this in itself feels good, it also feels a bit like work. I'm still doing something, focusing. And then the real freedom seems to come only when I fail in being mindful?

What do you all think of that?",0
"I think this is a relevant sub to post this question in. 

There's this common problem that a lot of people have. They might enjoy an activity or hobby.......however after a certain point, it starts to become a drag. The point can vary from people to people. Some people don't even have a point if the hobby in question is their number one passion. However for most activities and most people, this point exist. Especially if its something that requires long hours of work like Animation or programming. They don't necessarily hate the activity after going beyond this point, but they lose motivation and that spark that makes the activity really fun. It becomes monotonous after this point. 

I have this problem with this animation. When I started it as a hobby, I used to love it. Used to spend hours every day working on my own projects. But then when I pursued it further at university and it became more of a job to me......that's when it lost its spark. Felt like a drag. I still feel motivation from time to time but its not as exciting as it was before when it was a hobby. 

This is a mental thing. When it was a hobby, I chose to do it. When it became like a job, I was forced to do it. So even though I was doing the exact same thing and spending the same number of hours, the motivation depended on what context I was working in. So I know this is all in the head, and nothing else. 

Is it possible to use the same philosophies used in meditation to make yourself voluntarily enjoy an activity even though it seems like a drag? How do you make your mind do it? Whenever I enjoy my work, the quality of it improves, so enjoyment is very important.",0
"So after a bad break up from a long term relationship (14-19)  I have been meditating every day using headspace for about 70 days. 

I'm finding that being in a mindful state and letting thoughts pass me by and focusing in the moment just leaves me with a sort of sad aftertaste or tone to my life and is quite easy to still react negatively to some troubling persistent thoughts. And these thoughts are almost always there. 

Whereas recently, I have been adopting the 'fuck thinking or caring about that' mentality and it seems to be working in terms of im not getting sad anymore and its more mild anger which is directed at work and actually makes me work harder. ( I work in house removals so the anger rush gets taken out on me carrying boxes upstairs fast lol and is followed by a sense of relief and joy)

I really want to stay with the meditation journey and be filled with gratitude and compassion whilst letting thoughts go BUT im thinking a sort of anger mentality is more effective right now? I'm interested to know what anyone thinks, thanks.",0
"I've been reading Alan Watts recently, and he makes this beautiful point about concentration, and that to not debate the nature of why you're concentrating or whether you're concentrating or not, but to just do it.

I applied that for the first time today, it was something I was already beginning to understand, and then today, though not for long, there were times where it was pure consciousness, pure concentration. It would last a maximum of like five seconds and then my mind would go 'this is great' and hence ruin the whole thing. But I'm not disheartened by that. I know where I'm going with this now. 

It's weird. What I'd thought meditation was has now changed, but for the better. It's actually really so painfully simple conceptually, and it's actually this over simplicity which makes things hard. All meditation requires is to simply 'be'. That's it. Don't think about whether you're sat in the right position, or whether you're doing it for long enough, or any of those things. Just be. Relax, breathe naturally and don't complicate things.

I meditated for half an hour today, and that's my new personal record. I hate to turn it into an achievement because ultimately that's not the end goal, about doing it for longer. What matters is that I feel as if it's not as hard as I thought it was now. When I started out meditating, I was putting so much pressure on myself and ultimately my ego would always bounce back when things weren't going my way and I would just give up because eventually what I'd think is, 'oh ffs this isn't working there's no point.' Part of the beauty is to actually explore that. Recognising that you are finding it difficult and getting back to just 'being'. 

I'm sure there will be a lot of experts who might see this as basic shit or even think I'm not doing it properly, but I write this for beginners like myself to persevere and to not put pressure on themselves. Even if you have a session where your ego is louder than normal and you can't seem to concentrate for one second, stick with it. You're building resistance through becoming the observer, and if you are like me, it will become easier with time.",0
"Until about 2-3 weeks ago i was in one of the worst depressive episodes of my life (lasted almost all summer). I started meditating again mid last month. I didn’t really notice anything until today when I was in the car and noticed how happy I was. Or how calm I was. Or how I don’t spiral when something goes wrong. And it just kind of happened... I don’t know when in the last 2-3 weeks it happened but it did.

My one advice for everyone is to stop constantly checking your progress. Keep meditating and one day hopefully you too will be in the middle of an errand and just realize how different life suddenly is.",0
"Was watching Sam Harris talk to the minimalists today. He said that if he had to give a pithy answer about living a meaningful life and keeping suffering to a minimum then it would be that ""when you're suffering you're lost in thought.""

It's no secret that most of us spend most of our lives lost in thought, though for people with OCD I would suspect it's even worse. Intrusive thoughts can come in at any time and spoil any ""presence"" one is lucky enough to stumble across at any given moment. 

I'm not going to beat around the bush here, I'm very depressed and anxious and suicidal and life for me is generally quite painful. Mostly due to internal rather than external circumstances. I have a good life, family etc. My job makes me pretty miserable in fairness but I'm fairly confident most of my problems are due to my state of mind. 

I do meditate for ten minutes every day, I have been since late last year and I'm tempted to say it has been helping somewhat, though as this post indicates it's clearly not enough on its own. 

I'm gonna go get some therapy in an attempt to try and make life less painful. Lately, I've often been waking up with morning anxiety and morning sickness (dry heaving, unable to eat). Occasionally my first thought, when I wake up, is ""your parents are going to die one day"", and that sends my head into a spin. 

Why do I have to worry about things I can't control, things that haven't happened yet. There's no utility in this worry whatsoever. It's just pointless. 

Anyway, as I said I'm gonna go and get some CBT in an effort to combat this. I'm almost afraid to honestly because I've had my hopes raised and destroyed so many times that I'm afraid of feeling that again because it's awful and fills me with the deepest despair. 

I suppose the point of this post is to ask, how feasible is it for a person with OCD to reach a state of mindfulness with only meditation in their psychological toolkit or is much more needed just to get you through one's life. I've tried medication and I'm not a fan. CBT is the only thing I've never really committed to. 

Because ultimately, if it's difficult for a regular person to reduce the quantity of though interrupting the present moment then for a person with OCD it must be ultra-hard. And I'm not sure I can cope anymore. 

Thanks for reading,

"I'm still fairly new to meditating. Maybe three months in. I'm in a phase where I'm just trying everything. I have some favorite methods and I try the ones I find online. 


But. I know a lot of people have some things to say about some of the guided meditations on YouTube. Specifically the ones that promise you things like manifestation or traveling to the akashic records or reduce anxiety and depression. 


But I have noticed some guided meditations do seem to work well for me. So I was curious if anyone with more experience would offer opinions of some. Either good or bad.  I know it's different for everyone but I think any newbie would like to know.",0
"I had a very emotionally stressful weekend that triggered a lot of my past troubles and made my anxiety flare up really bad. Last night I laid in bed meditating asking for my spirit guides and guardian angels to come and help guide me. Guide me to my right path and to help me release any negative energy, thoughts, or fears that were keeping me from my truth. I felt tears drop as I was thinking these things and I believed them with all sincerity. As I was continuing my request. My eyes, which were closed, went from seeing darkness to a bright sky blue. Not as if there was a light in my room, that’s just the color it changed too. Then I heard, not with my ears, but in my mind another thought other than mine that said, “ I am Mother Mary.” Right at that moment I felt a huge sense of relief, like an end to my sadness. I felt comforted and calmed, and I started singing “Let It Be” by The Beatles in my mind out of nowhere. My meditation was disrupted by my neighbors and I came out of it. I know I wasn’t asleep yet because I am aware of all my thoughts and sounds around me. I laid there for a few minutes trying to process what had just happened. I still can’t figure it out.

"I have been meditating for more than a year. I know all the ideas and concepts of leting go, accepting, surrender to reality, unconditional love,  awareness etc. Had some epiphanies, self realizations which helped me for a while. Nowadays It seems I just can't let go of my ego anymore. I get angry more often. Sometimes I try to be mindful and not act on it. Sometimes I act on it, then feel guilty. I judge more often, become reactive. I know I should not be doing it, at least I am aware of ego doing that. I feels like I am going backwards and my ego is dominating me more than before. There are so many ideas and concept in my head, my mind always try to reach a conclusion from them to justify my action. I felt a huge shift in my motivation, level of happiness, satisfaction in the beginning of this year. I accomplished things which I never thought  I could do. I felt good all time like being high 24/7. I felt real joy and fullfuillment. Suddenly it all stopped. Everything started to seem meaningless, depressing. The self improving, spiritual ideas don’t interest me anymore. Nothing feels real anymore. I feel like a negative fearful energy always trapped inside me. I crave for that lost good feeling I used to feel. I always keep searching in my head what was that idea that triggered the transformation.  Why am i not progressing anymore? Should I increase the duration of meditation or follow any different technique? How do I stop this downward spiral of depression and self judgement?",0
"I started to like her last year during our high school dance lessons, then it developed to a slight crush for the rest of the past school year. Summer break seemed to diminish my crush on her. Then I started my meditation and NoFap journey. Everything looked fine.

During the past few weeks, I noticed that I still have feelings for her, this time (maybe because of meditation etc.) it feels much stronger. When I have nothing else to do, I can't stop thinking about her.

I haven't told her, I decided that will dedicate the rest of this year to meditation and celibacy. Because I think I need to work on my self esteem, confidence and school duties first, and meditation seems to be very helpful.

My question is: How to deal with such intense emotions, noticing them and reminding myself that it will pass, barely seems to affect them.",0

"Hi all! 

I’m somewhat new to the community and I’ve been inspired to get into meditating more seriously. So far I’ve really only done it as a component of a yoga class or way to fall asleep, but I’d like to pick it up as a daily habit. Since I’m so new I’d like to start with guided meditations to help me stay on track and learn how to meditate better. 

I’m looking specifically for improved focus and more self control- I feel like I’m lacking in my ability to control my brain from just autopiloting to social media (yeah, the irony of this post is not lost on me), I’m not as good about saying no to sweets as I should be, and I just generally have a hard time with my attention span and focus. I would just like to generally improve those areas!

"I've found Sam Harris's Waking Up app to be very helpful in learning how to meditate. This is partly because Sam goes so far out of his way to avoid anything that might even get close to bordering on belief. But as I get a little more comfortable with the practice, and listen to other well known figures like Ram Dass (who unlike Sam talks enthusiastically and with apparent sincerity about Hindu gods like Hanuman), I find myself getting more and more curious about the religious underpinnings of the practice. At the same time, I'm a typical western secularist and wouldn't have much ability to tolerate blatant proselytizing. Does anyone have any recommendations for good sources on Hindu or Buddhist belief that sort of fit into that niche of taking the belief seriously without trying to convert you?",0
"My task is to stop berating myself when I make mistakes.

I don’t need to feel any shame for my actions that are performed with good intentions. I just need to take note of how I can modify my behavior, and try my best to implement that behavior.

I do not intend to inconvenience or confuse people. Sometimes I go on autopilot and get lost in thought, and I make mistakes because of it. THIS IS THE STAGE I AM IN. I don’t need to hate myself for this. What I need to do is continue to work toward good mental and physical health, and peacefulness.

I failed to deal with some painful losses in my life in a healthy way, so I turned to alcohol for about a year. This is the main reason I lack mental clarity. Now that I’m sober and getting healthier physically, mentally, and emotionally, I know my life is going to get easier and simple tasks aren’t going to feel like such a burden. So right now, my task is to trust that all is coming in time and practice, and I shouldn’t hate myself for the stage I’m at, even though I'm not satisfied with it. I can hold onto that dissatisfaction with myself lovingly. Deep down, I love myself, so I want to be healthy and have great mental clarity.

I don't think people choose to become addicts. No one wants that. Many people are ignorant of how addictions form, and they're egotistical thinking that they are above chemical dependency. That ego has to come from somewhere, I don't even think we choose to have big egos or choose to be arrogant/selfish/etc..

There was no buddhism, no yoga or meditation teacher, no therapist in my world growing up. I became conditioned to respond to things a certain way, and while I did use my will to make lots of choices that shaped who I am, I was only presented with so many options for how I was going to respond to the world. I often felt forced to go along with things and do what was expected of me by my parents and friends.

Because literally ALL of my friends in the neighborhood were homophobic, (white suburb in Southern U.S.) I felt like I had no choice but to be too, so for a few years when I was about 8-12, I made very hateful ""jokes"" about gay people just to be included. I wasn't strong enough to choose to stand up to my friends, which is too bad, but should I hate myself for it? I have to believe that hateful people, egomaniacs and addicts deserve love too. I can't just hate myself forever, even though I now view things like homophobia as one of the worst traits a human being can possibly have. I might have been a brat, but I wasn't evil. I was just scared of being rejected by my friends. It may not have even occurred to me that being gay could possibly be anything other than wrong. That was just the reality I was presented with.

In general, I highly doubt people are gonna harm themselves with alcohol or anything else if they're emotionally well-adjusted and happy- I don't know yet what the ""root cause"" is that makes alcohol feel so good to me, all I know is that I've always had anxiety even since I was around middle school age (24 now), and alcohol has always taken it away.

I am going to manage my anxiety and stay sober. And I know that you are going to achieve whatever sort of peacefulness you are searching for too &lt;3 Thanks for reading my emotionally-charged ranting :D",0
"Hi all!

We all know that it can be hard to start and maintain a regular sitting practice. So I wondered if anyone would care to join me in a daily meditation challenge for October?

I've set up a monthly meditation challenge for the last eighteen months, and it's really seemed to strike a chord here and received lots of engagement and positive feedback over that time. I stuck to daily meditation throughout much of that time myself (struggled a little some months, but I do have a two year old son at the moment!), and many others who took part have managed consistent practice throughout that time. It provided a lovely sense of community and lots of encouragement.

So, here's the deal:

You choose how much time you want to spend meditating each day, and what sort of meditation you're going to practice. But you commit to practicing every day for the month of October, and maybe check in on here with others who are doing the same. The idea is to have some group support/accountability, to help you stick to daily practice all month long.

If it goes well, then we rinse and repeat for the month of November. I'll make a new post for that when the time comes.

Post a comment below if you'd like to take part. And if you'd like an accountability partner to really help see you through your daily practice, post a comment below that says ""accountability partner needed"". Then wait for someone else to reply to your comment, and say ""I'll be your partner"". You can help keep each other in check throughout the month.

For those who use Insight Timer, there is a group for this called Meditation Month. Feel free to join up and find some extra accountability there.

For those who use it, there is also a discord server for this. I won't be over there myself, but if you want to join the url is https://discord.gg/afyEk32 - thanks to /u/3DimenZ for setting it up.

Good luck folks. Hope this helps some of you start a meditation habit and others get back into one.

TLDR: Encouragement and support for people trying to make daily meditation stick!

NOTE: I like to encourage everyone who wants to take part and who leaves a comment below by wishing them luck and other little things in response. But I don't reply to people who have asked for an accountability partner in their comment because I don't want them to get a little ""new message"" icon and get hopeful only to find it's me saying ""good luck!"", and also because I think people scanning comments to see if anyone needs a partner might more easily look past those that already have a reply, even if the reply is just from me and isn't actually an offer to be a partner. Just wanted to let those folks who don't get a reply from me know that it's nothing personal! I wish you luck too, and am pleased you're taking part! :)

NOTE 2: Since starting these monthly challenges, the Insight Timer group has grown to 900+ members, and the Discord even more than that! So join in and help make meditation a regular part of your life!

Just.

"I just started meditating this week, but I've found meditating to be really helpful for my anxiety and work productivity.  When my mind would normally run off through stressful fantasy scenarios and worries I've been able to catch it and recenter my focus on either my breath or what I'm doing.  Sleeping was really really difficult for me because my mind would race even faster, thinking about and imagining anything and everything.  I've been using the same techniques to help me sleep at night and it works, my mind still wants to take off but I try not to let thoughts get carried away and I've been able to sleep (so far) a 24h 30m cycle whereas before I was on maybe a 30h cycle roughly, depending on the day.  Still have to get better at the waking up part to actually keep 24 hours lol.

So the part this is all leading up to.  Ever since I started this, my dreams have been *really* vivid, on the level of my most vivid dreams and it's every night.  I'm also waking up multiple times throughout the night, however I don't know if that's new or if I'm just noticing it now but that's also every night, usually once in the middle of the night and once around sunrise.

"Hello all,

I’m currently studying abroad and taking some time in solitude to do a little introspection. I’ve practiced meditation inconsistently for years, but for the last 6 weeks I’ve been going at it twice a day and I feel amazing.

I write to you all because I’ve recently noticed the lack of control my significant other has over her emotions. I’ve always been the more level headed one in the relationship, and I try not to let her mood effect mine (a difficult task I find myself struggling with, but one I’m getting better at through my practice).

Furthermore, I’ve tried to explain the benefits of practice but she hasn’t taken to it. I’m nearing the end of my college career and we will soon be discussing whether we should end it as a college fling, or make an effort to stay together. I’m not here to ask for relationship advice, instead I’m curious if anyone has any input based on their current/past relationships.

Does your significant other practice meditation? If not, do you find yourself bothered by their lack of emotional understanding/insight which you’ve gained through your practice? Am I looking at this the wrong way, and should instead learn to accept her mood as external and focus on my internal sense of calm?

Any and all responses would be appreciated :)",0
"Most people experience thoughts verbally. Fewer people are aware of the conceptual structure of thought. It's actually possible to experience the concept without the verbal thought that arises.

Very few people are aware that emotions are the carrier wave of thought. It's possible to develop an awareness that discerns the concept, the verbalization, and the underlying emotional tone of thought.

Generally speaking, if you have a thought, particularly one you have identified with, then that thought is always carried by emotional current. Ordinary thought, for the vast majority of people, is never truly rational.

Since these emotions are carrier waves of thought and concepts, there is a kind of negotiation that takes place in your mind and body. What may seem conceptually illogical to other people feels logical to yourself, because the way two thoughts link together are carried by the same emotional current, or have resonance.

Thoughts that seem irrational has more to do with thoughts carried by dissonant emotional current, than it does with concepts that are actually logical.

When an emotional current that carries a thought is unpleasant, people try not to think about that thought. That is experienced anywhere from that nagging itch in your subconscious, to violent emotions that lead to personal attacks to other people, to outright ignorance where the person literally blocks it out of their mind. These are aversions.

When an emotional current carries a thought that is pleasant, people try to cling on to it. These are graspings. Grasping is part of how we form identities around thoughts. These thoughts come in the form of, ""I am ..."". For example, careers (""I am a scientist"", ""I am a mechanic"", ""I am a software engineer""), group memberships (""I am a Quoran""), nationalism (""I am American""), racial identity (""I am Asian""), gender identity (""I am male"", ""I am female"", ""I am transgendered""). We do this to form various stories or narratives about our lives (""I am a good person"", ""I am persecuted"", ""I am a hero-entrepreneur"", ""I am a hacker living at the edge of the law"").

Sometimes the emotional current, driven by the carrot (graspings) and stick (aversions), often time leads thought patterns into a loop. It's not that there is a logical loop, it's that the emotional current that carries those thoughts goes in loops.

There is no way to logic your way out of these kinds of loops, or truly validate your own thoughts. That's because, in order to use logic, the way most people use it, requires an emotional current to carry thoughts. The typical emotional current someone uses to logic their way out of things is forms of self-judgement, denial, etc.

There is a very fast and simple way to get to the stillness, from which you stop this identity. (The fast way is not necessarily the easiest way):

- Take an inhale.
- Let it go in an exhale.
- Take an inhale
- Let it go in an exhale. As you let it go, find that gap between the exhale and the inhale. This gap is natural. This is a gap of stillness, where it feels like everything stops. Try this as many times as you can get this.
- Once you can find that gap of stillness between the exhale and the inhale, look for the gap of stillness between the inhale and exhale.
- When you can clearly find the stillness between the two parts of breath, look for the stillness from which the breath arises. What will happen is that the experience of that stillness will start to grow until it becomes continuous.
- Flip your perception, where that stillness is the vast reality, and the breath merely arises and passes in the stillness.

Stay there. You will likely notice that thoughts will start arising and passing in this stillness. Just as you recognize the breath as empty, recognize the thought, it's underlying emotions, and the sensations as empty.

A related technique is to learn to ""listen to the silence."" Silence is where all sounds arises from. So first get comfortable with finding the stillness in the breath. Then, be aware of the internal dialogues that arises. Then listen to the sound of the internal dialogue, not necessarily the content. Then listen to Silence from which that sound arises from. That Silence is the same as the stillness, experienced aurally rather than kinesthetically. If you can listen to the silence, it is one of the fastest ways to sort out what is bullshit in your mind.

"Identification with thought.

Human beings are the most self-suffering creatures on this planet and the greatest irony is, that we are suffering because of our own actions. We have almost wiped out half the species from the planet to bring well being to ourselves and in spite of all our ""comfort"" we are still not happy. 

The fundamental reason for this discontent and unhappiness is that we are not able to handle our own mind - we are too identified with our own thought process. The nature of the mind is such that once it gets identified with anything, it will only think about that. 

So if you are really interested in your own wellbeing, the first and foremost thing which you need to do is to stop identifying with your own thoughts, they are not even yours. Your thoughts are essentially coming from all of the information which you have collected from your environment, filtered through all your prejudices, judgement and conditioning.

This entire concept of non identification with your ""own"" thoughts is hard for most people to grasp, but this is truly the source of most of our self inflicted suffering.",0
"I just had a short sit and had the unusual urge to drown out all unwanted sound. I have a pair of concert ear-buds that are attached to my key carabiner, and I threw those in just prior. Wow. I read a post on this sub pertaining to ""breathless state"" and not only do I believe I truly entered that state very quickly, but the supplementary thoughts/chatter was diminished significantly. I feel so alert and calm after that short time. Highly recommended",0

"Practicing mindfulness with the knowledge that noting bad thoughts can make you happy sometimes sets it up in the mind as process with a result - making certain negative/limiting thoughts bad guys in that process that 'need' to be noted. 
This directly opposes the larger idea that thoughts are mental events that don't inherently have power.

Sometimes, that means I seek immediate feedback that I did it right when using mental noting (maybe wanting the feeling to disappear or to feel some internal click after I note a thought). This is thrown me into a loop with off-the-cushion the practice for about a year now. 

So, how can you practice noting/mindfulness without seeking a result when you know doing it right can make you happy?",0

"Hello Reddit. For the past dozen or so weeks I have been meditating daily, the majority of which with the guidance of the Waking Up app. It has been great, and I am keen to explore my practice further. 

Lately I have started to notice that during my formal meditation sessions I can spend quite long periods lost in thought. Of course, the more I meditate, the more I realise I am lost in thought (read: the more I realise how crazy I am), and I start to notice thoughts in all kinds of dusty nooks and crannies. But even though I feel this deepening of awareness, I feel like my concentration could be improved. In particular I would like to be able to concentrate on my breath longer without getting lost in thought (sometimes I'll get lost in thought and snap out of it, ""Okay man, it's time to focus on your breath,"" only to get lost in the same train of thought seconds later). (As a side note: I find it totally amazing how 'lost' you can be while lost in thought. Sometimes snapping out of a train of thought is as jarring as opening your eyes onto a brightly lit landscape.)

So my question is, can you recommend some complementary meditation to supplement my daily mindfulness practice? Is this a matter of 'keep practicing'? In a conversation between Joseph Goldstein and Sam Harris, Goldstein talks about the concentration he developed from his Metta meditations. I am considering adding a daily Metta session to my practice.

I would love to hear about your experiences.",0
"Hi!

After 2,5 years of daily practice (from 30 minutes to two hours per day) I'm looking to do a teacher training. I'm thinking mindfullness, but I'm open to suggestions (if there's a training that involves several styles, say metta &amp; mindfullness, that would be cool). The spiritual philosophy that appeals to me the most is advaita vedanta. Maybe I'm bit of an eclectic!  


Has anyone here taken a teacher training they would recommend? I'm looking for the intensive versions, not the ones where you do a couple retreats over the course of a year or so. Thanks!",0

I have aphantasia, a condition where i am unable to voluntarily visualize images in my head. When i close my eyes and try to visualize something it is completely dark. I can not even visualize the faintest shapes of something.

This causes me to not really understand and be able to enjoy the full benefits of visualization in meditation. Eventhough i think it would be so beneficial in a lot of situations.

Is there anybody here with the same condition that knows how to deal with this? Or does anybody have any tips on this matter?

"Why one does not see ‘what is True’?

One is carried away as if science, economics or religion-spirituality will remove or undo pain and uncertainty one faces in daily life.

One is carried away as if some one else (guru and so on) has solved the enigma of life and is living as relieved, pleased.

One is carried away as if addition to possessions, relations or knowledge will give one stable relief, stable pleasure.

All pain and uncertainty is psychological discomfort, if you are not in immediate physical danger. Unless you absorb this discomfort without any explanation, there is no chance of seeing ‘what is True’.

Whatever one is experiencing – confusion, irritation, happiness, fear – not to run away to solaces or other explanations to cover up what one is experiencing, is the key.",0
"Through my meditation practice I have reached a state where I am really not afraid of anything and I fundamentally don’t care whether I “succeed” in life or not. But there is a constant battle inside me between the part of me that believes that and the part of me that wants to get rich and “succeed” by societys standards. The thing is that I don’t want to get rid of these wishes as I would feel like if I never reach wealth and get to live the rich life I would be missing out on 50% of the action. I don’t see money as the measure of success or the goal of my life but rather as something that I want to try out (being rich, that is).

And from there comes my fear “what if I never get to experience the rich life” and that anxiety is constantly making me feel like I’m not enough..

"Hi, Im new and this is my first post. 
I started meditation a few months ago and been constant since start. I felt changes and evolution everyday. 
I've been reading this sub and TMI sub mostly, some here and there and digging about this in lot of aspects and places. I Went to a buddist meditation centre close to my place once to check and am finishing Shinryu suzuki's zen mind, begginner mind. But i must say that you are my teachers, i sincerely thank you for your dedication to help and be nice, even though this is my first post, your help to others reached me too S2

The thing is... Now that im aware/alert a llllot, i noticed that the only way i can sleep is to let my mind wander.
I noticed this when i started to come back from wandering automatically as a consecuence from practice and it would kick me up from almost sleeping.  Now there are a lot of days that my mind just doesnt wander and i lay quiet and sleep just doesnt come anymore..

Its weird because i read you can sleep beeing aware soo..

Please give me some pointers and love you all for this.

i'll try to sleep now",0
"In meditation and self help fields the word consciousness and awareness are used all the time. As a newbie to it, it was difficult to understand exactly what it meant and how to expand it. After an experience a few days ago at the basketball court while working on my dribbling I noticed the current limits of my awareness.  The drill I was doing was to stare at the backboard while dribbling the ball to the right hand, left hand, through the legs etc.  Now this isn't hard for everybody but doing this while keeping awareness of your feet and hands and keeping a steady stream of vision on the hoop was challenging. I realized my eyes would be pointed at the hoop while dribbling but I wouldn't actually be looking at the hoop. It was almost like I was day dreaming because I was focused on something I couldn't see. And I found trying to stare at one spot, while keeping a dribble without going into this day dream mode was challenging.

The way awareness makes sense to me is to look at your awareness as an empty space.  The space is filled up with your body and sense organs. So you have the *basic 5 senses*  but **two additional senses** as well which are **thoughts and feelings**. The world is pretty much just a sea of vibrations, and your sense organs pick up different types of vibrations. The goal is to give all of these senses the same amount of attention and not to play favorites.  We play favorites to our vision when watching TV. Our hearing when listening to music and our thoughts when over thinking. Obviously some senses will dominate others depending on what your doing but you can always feel what's going on with your body no matter what's going on. An easy way to turn inward is feeling every step as you walk (or manual breathing) or while doing any activity will help you access deeper dimensions of life. Your field of awareness doesn't strive to be aware of anything, these senses just fall into your field of awareness like water filling up a cup. **So you don't expand your awareness forcefully, you learn to be more receptive**.   Being aware of your inner space while having external things going on feels like being in 2 dimensions of reality at once and is fascinating to me.

So being aware of the sensations of the ball on my fingers, the hoop, the sounds from the ball and the rest of the park, the ground underneath my feet, are all objects in my awareness.  I couldn't be aware of all of these things (not to mention my breath) at the same time for more then a few seconds because the brain naturally filters out things that are not of use at the time.  Most of us are just as unaware of these things in everyday life and I realize I can bring this basketball practice drill into everyday life. Like while talking to someone sometimes you feel like a floating head. Now I try to feel my feet on the floor and feel my hands and notice my breath. Even though I can't sustain this attention on these objects in my awareness for a long time it feels very natural and is a very good way to stay in the moment. Because staying in the moment is sort of like double dutch. You have to Jump into it and just GO.

By maintaining awareness throughout the day I can notice when a headache might be about to form and can adjust whatever I need to. I feel stomach aches when they're just forming and can start taking deep belly breaths.  I notice thought loops and can stop feeding them quicker. Thoughts are just in your head so by feeling your feet on the floor you'll notice those thoughts really aren't that big of a deal and are just one aspect of who you are. I hope this explanation helps the people who never could quite grasp awareness or realize the depths of it.",0

"I’m been meditating for half a year now. At first the change I felt was subtle, but overtime the changes were becoming more obvious. With all of this said I have definitely made some progress but I don’t feel like I’m where I’m “suppose” to be at 6 months. People talk of meditating for 2 months and are already seeing drastic changes, while I’m still dealing with monkey mind and can’t concentrate on my breathe to save me life. I asked myself (as well as others) what I was doing wrong, but I realize there’s no wrong or right way as long as I’m getting what I need out out a meditation; I can’t help but feel annoyed with myself that I haven’t mastered my “monkey mind by now”.",0

"I posted something similar a few weeks ago but this has been bothering me so I figured I would post again. 

I have a really, really hard time being myself in a lot of social situations. I am still ""myself"", but a less fun/goofy/outgoing version of me, and as hard as I try I can't ""turn myself on"" (you know what I mean) and I almost am become exhausted just by trying to force myself to be myself. And I find myself unable to relax and feel uncomfortable/strained when socializing sometimes. It really pisses me off, because I will meet people and they will tell me I seem like a more shy person and introverted, but I know that they aren't getting the full version of me. Now, there have been plenty of times where somehow I've had no problem being myself and everything goes fantastically, but I can never figure out what that mental block is that is preventing me in the other situations. 

I always notice in social situations I feel me judging myself the whole time wondering if I look stupid, sound stupid, etc. And I find myself trying to please others (not by lying and saying stuff that they would like, but by saying nothing that would offend/upset/annoy etc) that I am interacting with, not directly, but it is kind of subconscious. 

Some back story: I used to be in a codependent relationship that I have since healed from, but I notice some codependent traits in myself sometimes, although I don't consider myself a codependent person completely. For example, at times, a big desire for acceptance, perfectionism, somewhat controlling, lack of trust, and low self worth. 

Another side note: I grew up religious but I am kind of reforming my beliefs on many things. For example, I started drinking alcohol but my whole lfe growing up I hated alcohol and thought it was a big sin and thought it was stupid but now I am doing it. So I am experiencing some cognitive dissonance as well. 

Sometimes I question ""who am I really"" and ""what do I actually believe about this thing?"" And all of this stuff can make it hard for me to connect with new people. I just care way too much about what people think about me (and I don't know why because I have plenty of things to be proud of and confident about) and I don't know how to stop it. Sorry for the massive amount of text, but thanks in advance for any help/tips/advice.",0
"I started meditating following Sam's (waking up) course three weeks ago. It's all interesting and makes sense to me, but even I'm trying to follow all of his lessons and following the instructions the best I can, nothing special was felt or experienced, besides the fact that I'm more relaxed and less reactive to my negative thoughts.

Today was different, after meditating and ending my session I went to bed as usual but.... jez. My attention was very very sharp, I felt some waves of pleasure going through my belly and it was like the whole stream of thought became very slow. I tried to maintain that good feeling of peace and happiness but it only lasted for 5 minutes.

Is it a thing that experienced mediators can reach with more facility? Should I increase the time of my sessions in order to feel it again? Thanks for reading.",0
I’ve never really been an anxious or stressed person until recently. I’m a senior in college and honestly just worrying about what I’m going to do after I graduate. I’ve wanted to start meditation for a while and I feel like it’s a perfect time for me to fully commit.,0
"I've been using this video's method of mindfulness breathing meditation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMMerxh_12U

Part of the advice it gives is to set an alarm timer to go off after your 5/10/20 minutes so you're not constantly wondering about your remaining time. That's all well and good, but I noticed that when it rings, even though it is pretty low volume and super soft in tone, it never fails to startle me. To the point where I'm sometimes reticent to start meditating, knowing a mini-jumpscare awaits at the end.

Has anyone encountered this? How did you solve this problem?",0
"I have been meditating for over 3 years now. I learned through headspace and then moved onto like 15-20 minutes of just silence. When I first started meditation I did it every day for a year and then I continued to be very structured with it until recently. 

My wife and I have a 4 month old daughter and she has been the focus every since she came out so my practice has slacked to 1-3 days a week tops. I tend to only meditate in the morning. 

Very recently though at work I got my own office and started to meditate in the afternoon. I will focus on my breath and quickly fall into this deep state of sleep/stillness. It’s hard for me to describe but I felt myself going from 10-15 minutes to 20-30 minute sessions. I don’t think it’s sleep because I have fallen asleep during it before and my head will nod out and I will awaken. It reminds me of when I would do a sensory deprivation tank or the short time when I was testing out mantra meditation. I’m not exactly conscious but then again I’m not completely unconscious.

"Hi friends,    
I was on a retreat for a week. Some lectures were about meditation &amp; mindfulness. Here are some notes, which you might find interesting:
  
**Meditation**  
 * is to develop and cultivate mindfulness and positive mental states and learn to maintain stable attention.  
 * sequence: sitting posture, intentions, bodyscan+relaxation, and only then to the mediation object+background awareness.   
* the mind is trained through intentions (e.g. mindful, loving, alert, interested, confident), repetitions (joy, gratitude after distraction &amp; intentions) &amp; positive conditioning.  
* getting to know, training, healing the mind  
  
**Mindfulness**   
* is the optimal/appropriate interaction between attention and background awareness.   
* comes from ""sati"", literally translated: to remember  
* collection is the consequence of regular mindfulness practice.  
* practice of Metta as a balance to mindfulness  
* four basics: body+movement, mood+feelings, sensations (pleasant, neutral, unpleasant), reality  
* four areas: Environment, Self, Other, Reality  
* thoughts about the future and the past are mindful when they are done consciously and intentionally.   
  
I had my notes translated from German by Deepl, so some terms may not be entirely consistent.

I can't say I haven't gotten *anything* from the practice, but the rewards aren't outweighing the challenges.   

The sessions are rarely *unpleasant*\--I can physically sit for the 20 minutes--but after almost three years it would be nice to find myself *welcoming* the opportunity to sit rather than the ever-present ""Ugh, I've got to do *this* again..."".  

So why not just stop?    That's what I'm wrestling with at the moment.   If this is an important (inevitable?) part of the process, then I'd hate to give up at an important milestone.  On the other hand, if this just isn't for me, then why keep banging my head against this wall?",0

"Hello, yesterday while meditation my mind started to repeat 'guilty', like a mantra repeating it while I was sitting. I experience a lot of negative emotion and thoughts about suicide and very dark stuff, however I stopped identifying with the thoughts so it doesn't bother me much. But I would like to have ""good"" thoughts, because I notice when I interact with people, the act is influenced by the state of the thoughts. Is there a way to somehow kill this part of the mind? When I speak with other people I go unconscious like instantaneously, and start to suffer. It's hard to stay clear when other people are near me, is there a way to stay clear with more distractions?. I do vipassana meditation. I also noticed that while thinking my larynx moves, like little micro movements. This is when I think in words. When I focus on it thoughts on the surface level stop, what does this mean? While writing this I also notice it, it's like I am speaking without any words.",0

DIAMOND SUTRA

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK9u7Jz-vNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK9u7Jz-vNA)

&amp;#x200B;

3:42 - no form or phenomenon (ego, personality, self, separate person, universal self)

&amp;#x200B;

4:10 - Be detached(react calmly to highly emotional circumstances) when practicing compassion and charity without regard to appearances, without regard to form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or any quality of any kind.  

&amp;#x200B;

6:08 - All forms are illusive and unreal.

&amp;#x200B;

7:54 - Discard all arbitrary notions of the existence of a personal self, of other people, or a universal self.  But also discard any notions of the NON EXISTENCE of a personal self, other people or universal self.

&amp;#x200B;

8:30 - Discard not only all conceptions of your own selfhood, other selves, or universal self, but ALSO discard all notions of the non existence of such concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

9:03 - All of the above statements are like a Raft used to cross a river.  Once the river is crossed (you realize you are in the state of enlightenment), you don't need to think about any of these ideas or concepts anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

9:37 - No independently existing object of mind called the highest most fulfilled enlightened mind.  Because there are no separate independent things. Neither is nor is it not.

10:34 - Enlightenment is realized through an internally intuitive process. 

(like laughing at a joke)

&amp;#x200B;

12:16 - A true disciple who enters the stream of enlightenment doesn't see himself as a separate person entering any stream.  He doesn't even consider the concept at all.  He doesn't differentiate himself from others and has no regard for name shape sound odour taste touch or any quality can truly be called a disciple who's entered the stream.

&amp;#x200B;

12:55 - No passing away or coming into existence.  There is no one returning and no one not returning. 14:31

&amp;#x200B;

15:18 - A paradise cannot be created nor can it not be uncreated ??

Develop a mind that is in no way dependent upon sites sounds smells tastes sensory sensations or any mental conceptions.  Develop a mind that does not rely on anything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

22:44 - Buddhas discard all arbitrary conceptions of form and phenomenon, transcended all perceptions, and penetrated the illusion of all forms.

&amp;#x200B;

24:34 - Disciples should leave behind all distinctions of phenomenon, and not allow the mind to be evoked by the senses, sound, odors, flavours, sensory touch or any other qualities.  Stay independent of any thought that arises in your mind.  

&amp;#x200B;

30:38 - Help lead all beings to the shore of awakening but after they have been liberated, know that in truth not a single being has been liberated.  Because if a disciple cherishes the idea of a self, a person, a living being or a universal self, then that person is not an authentic disciple.  Why? Because there is NO independently existing object of mind called the highest most fulfilled awakened mind.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*33:15 - A true disciple knows that there is no such thing as a self, a person, a living being or universal self.  All things are devoid of selfhood or individuality.

&amp;#x200B;

38:40 - When you attain perfect Enlightenment you will feel as if nothing has been acquired.

You will come to the realization that you were always in that state.  It is neither a high state or a low state.  It's the state that you're in right now yet you don't have the wisdom yet to realize that you are already in it and were always in it.

&amp;#x200B;

39:45 - Be ethical and kind knowing there is no distinction between yourself and the selfhood of others. Practice kindness and charity without attachment.

&amp;#x200B;

48:53 - Your existence is very much like your existence in a dream.  Your dream self is not the real you.  It is a creation of your mind, much like all the objects and the people in that dream.",0
"I made an **[app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UnjinxApps.brainWaves&amp;referrer=present)** to help users to build and maintain regular meditation habits in a playful and interactive way. This app lets you start a meditation session and set a goal for how long you want to meditate. The app doesn't let you use your phone or even move it while the session is going on, or else the session is ended. The whole process from setting up the session to informing about the end is guided by a voice based virtual assistant.

Users get points for completing sessions which can help them level up. You can create a streak by holding a meditation session at least once every day, and there are different badges for milestones such as five days streak or twenty days streak. There is also a leaderboard with weekly, monthly and overall section where the users with the highest score in that time period are shown.

The app also has ambience sounds as well as a set of the most well-known binaural beats for those interested in it to help users get into the state of mind they want to reach.

I would really love any feedbacks about the app to help improve it!

"I’ve recently started meditating. As a result, I’m now aware of the fact that my mind basically runs nonstop. I’m constantly thinking about something, and usually that something is some far off person or thing or scenario. And to be honest, this newfound awareness is kind of driving me mad. Have any of you experienced this at the beginning of your meditation journey? If so, how did you deal with it?",0

"So my recent struggles are with remaining in the ""enlightened"" state as long as possible. Maybe I'm using the expression ""enlightened""  a bit exaggeratedly, but for me it's the good description of the state I'm in.  I managed to enter this state a few times and the best explanation of it is total freedom. Your thoughts pass through you and don't represent anything significant to you, you feel a space and distance from them, it feels like your actions and everything externally is being manifested by some higher intelligence, you feel really connected to the outside world, you can enjoy life in every moment, in every sight you see, sound you hear etc. It's like a constant state of flow. And every new time I was able to enter this state of being, the 'feeling' was more intense than the previous time, I could feel I'm in it deeper than before. The problem is, when I'm in that state, after a while I'm channelling a lot of positive thoughts and emotions from which is hard to distant yourself and not get caught into them. Also, as time passes some kind of undercover fear arises, a fear from losing this blissful state of being I'm currently in. I started meditating 9 months ago and been doing it regularly for around 4 months. I do it 1/2 times per day for around 15 minutes on average and I've gotten to the point where I can use the concepts from meditation in every day life so I can remain present and in the right state. My opinion is that I'm on the right track and I should continue to do what I'm doing, but I would love to hear from someone who had a similar experience or has an advice to give :)",0
"hey all!

i recently tried a couple of meditation apps (have been using headspace since the beginning of the year, but wanted to see what else is out there).  


the apps i have been comparing for a while now are 10% happier, waking up, headspace and calm. i summarized all the differences here: [https://youtu.be/6MVGJ50d8S4](https://youtu.be/6MVGJ50d8S4)

**10% happier:** high quality content, lots of lectures and courses available; goes pretty deep into spiritual areas that are only loosely related to meditation. unfortunately pretty pricy though once the week-long trial period runs out

**waking up:** app by famous author and neuroscientist sam harris; also extensive lectures and courses as well as guided meditation. the subscription costs as much as it does for 10% happier (100 dollars/year). has a mediation timer as well.

**headspace:** offers less courses and lectures than the previous apps; instead it focusses on guided meditation to a variety of different topics. the one guiding through the meditation has a great voice for it (at least i think so, haha). the subscription is also rather pricy, but in combination with spotify you get a discount. 

**calm:** bit different focus than the others. it sees mediation mostly as a tool to calm down and unwind, but offers other tools for that as well, such as calming sounds, bedtime stories and exercises for your breath. quite a lot cheaper than the other apps, while offering more variety. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure there are plenty of other apps out there worth trying, but those were the biggest names that i heard of. Do you agree? :)",0
"I would like to make a point about smartphones in general and I think it offers a different perspective on whether or not to meditate with an app.

Most people seem to be aware of the concept of 'here and now'. 

The opposite of 'here and now' is 'there and then'.

The perfect symbol for 'there and then' is the smartphone. It is the device that is ALL ABOUT 'there and then'. It is the exact opposite of 'here and now'. 

We don't use our phone to be 'here and now', we use it to connect to the 'there and then'. 

We use it to see what is happening elsewhere, to connect to people who are elsewhere, to look up the past, the possible future... if the mind was a device, it would be the smartphone. 

Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't use smartphones...

But meditation to me seems to be the perfect moment to turn off the 'there and then'-device just for a while.

There are many ways to let us know when the time we choose to meditate is up, if we want that.Timers, watches, church bells in the distance, etc.

A lot of people seem to think that as long as the phone is on airplane mode everything is fine and in that case using an app is also no problem. 

I can't say they are wrong. But I would like to present the other view which is that we have the 'there and then'- device turned on ALL DAY LONG.

So why not make a point and turn it off for whatever time we allocate to meditation?",0

"Hey everyone,  


This is not a traditional meditation, more like a safe astral experience in the tools that meditation teaches. The astral world has taught me so much I decided to slowly make series on how to do it yourself. It's all guided so you just relax and enjoy the experience. All that's needed is an open heart. It is also designed for you to meet higher beings during it so if that's a thought you don't like than don't listen to it.  


Have a wonderful day,

"I maybe totally wrong here but after month's of trying to meditate I've started noticing changes. I attend AA and in some meetings we take turn to read from the Big Book. I'm not very confident and I find reading difficult. The difficulty comes from my mind made story. Before I start to read I compulsively start to have this debilitating self talk. The chatter in my head says all sorts of negative things which of cause gets me nervous but it was like I associated with the self talk, it was part of me. Today I'm sat in my meeting about to read and I noticed the voices starting to happen. But this time i had the awareness and space to acknowledge the thoughts then take me my attention away from them and back on to been present. It felt extremely liberating and I was less nervous about reading after this.

Does this make sense?",0
"&amp;#x200B;

I've been meditating for almost 4 years now, can't say it has been consistent, but its been in steady enough for me teach me a lot about myself and the power of consciousness.

Initially, meditation was a form of relaxation from the busy and hectic mind and it was calming and just felt good, this was when I was 13/14, I didn't know much about mindfulness or the power of now and just thought it was a good stress reliever.

Several months down the line, i stopped because i got bored/lazy but this was the next big epiphany for me. I realised how observant and disciplined i had become, not because i had mediated but when i *stopped* meditating thoughts and emotions were leaking out of me constantly.

So I resumed to practise this disciplined and observant state to soften my reactions/action/thoughts and emotions and it has made me a changed man. I can see the world through an eagles eye, and i realise that all my past worries was just an illusion from the future/past.

3 years down the line and I'm still practising, not consistently yet but enough to make me happy and fulfilled.

At this point in time (16) I understand the healing/growing properties of mediation through present consciousness and focus on the individual muscles, the complete freedom and happiness that comes with living in the still present, observing the pain body through meditation to understand any form of pain which has helped me through tougher times and I've been in love with books about mindfulness in the past few years.

My mind is still and calm and the best part is I'm in complete and utter control of my universe I can handle any walls or barriers just through perception to free myself of the so-called 'problem'. It's been a humbling journey.

This might've interested or helped some of you, but I just felt the need to share this quiet experience and hear feedback.

So a couple of technical questions that I have encountered so far: \[so I just sit 2-3 times per day for 10 mins\]

[www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ08yx1LBzc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ08yx1LBzc)

\- for example in the above guideline vid it says ''focus on the blank'' where I assume the ''blank'' is the same ''thing'' as the ''murk'' known from Kasina meditation - is that correct? (I dont see any other option for it to be something else, really)

\- When I am to ''focus'' how this should be done from the technical point of view, as the ''blank'' is just a collection of white black grey etc dots , like a TV static noise when you put the screen on an empty channel

(I tend to look past it or maybe ''in between'' the dots)

\- When I am refocusing on the blank, my eyes tend to do physical movements. Sometimes I have to consciously move the gaze upwards because otherwise my eyes start to open (My left eye doesnt close 100% - some sort of genetic malfunction ;) my father had the same trait) -is this okay

\- Saliva swallowing - this is unavoidable but it tends to ruin deeper concentration, any advice?

\- Tongue posture? On the roof of my palate?

I'd be grateful for your time and answers - let today fill you with peace and happiness :) Namaste",0

"Hello good people.

So I have been doing meditation on and off for the past year and a half , and I am a noob.

My motivations are to be a more calm person , a person that can separate logic from emotion and see clearly in any situation and I feel that meditation can provide me with just that.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is , I have some issues regarding mediation that I need some help with.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Position - I've researched some guides and they pretty much all say to sit straight without anything to lean on , I find that to be very difficult as my back is starting to hurt after 7 minutes, sitting at the half lotus position my feet begin to hurt and begin to go numb , that pretty much distracts me as I focus on trying to realign my body for better comfort rather than focusing on the nothingness. Do I really need to sit straight or can I lean on something?
2. Distractions - I have ADHD , keeping my mind numb and empty is hard enough as it is but distractions.. well they distract me easily, unfortunately I have no better place to conduct my meditation.. ear plugs or headphones are considered bad habits , but are they really bad?
3. Duration - I don't really know how much time I should conduct my meditation but I've found that 15 minutes are the best medium for me as anything above that is hard to maintain , is that a good time to start with?",0

" 

Over the past five years I have been diving deeply and consistently into the nature of reality and myself. They're both the same thing. I have had several deep and very profound and indeed life changing nondual and psychedelic experiences at this point. I understand that everything in the totality of existence is all fundamentally and inexorably one. I have traveled to places within consciousness that are beyond the human imagination. I have had my sense of self and eradicated and reformed several times now. Looking into the viewport of infinity is indeed breathtaking beyond all comprehension. You really are absolutely infinite and so beautifully glorious beyond what our bodies and brains are physically evolved to comprehend right now.

However there is something within me that is seemingly contently disinterested with phenomenological existence. I do not want to play this game anymore. I feel like no matter what I experience in this life, no matter where I go there will still always be a part of me that is just over the experience of existing as an individuation of consciousness at any level whether it be at a human level, bacterium level or godlike cybernetic alien level it’s all not the absolute truth, just more of this multiversal, multidimensional game of exploratory consciousness.

After I live my life and die there is a very strong feeling at the “core” (there is no core) of my consciousness that I never want to reincarnate in any way. While that is an ego driven statement I feel that there is something within myself that this is coming from a place of much deeper much more comprehensive inner standing and understanding of phenomenological existence and it’s alternative merging COMPLETELY into God consciousness so fully that any hope or possibility of incarnation into the realm of form is entirely extinguished. No thought no mind, no form no play, simply infinite incomprehensible nothingness, the purest expression of God.  

Over the past year a feeling has arisen within myself that wants this life of this specific individuation of consciousness to be the last physical expression that this individuation of consciousness ever experiences. The feeling and sense of relief is what I long for. I long for the ending of all experience by this individuation. The thought of an I experiencing reality no longer is the all encompassing thing that it once was. Now the idea of an I experiencing reality seems so superficial and somewhat shallow in a sense. I enjoy life and its many phenomena but I can so clearly see ( at an increasing rate) the illusion of all of the realm of form.  

Expression, experience and phenomenological existence go together. And there is such a powerful longing within my energetic composition to just have relief from being, relief from form, relief from experience I feel like I have done this so many times. I feel that I have played this game an infinite number of times. Now there is a tiredness to it all. I am all,every subatomic particle, every atom, every cell, every organism in the multitude of multiverses every object in all of existence. I am the infinite Holon. I am immortal, timeless, and infinite in every way. Yet and still within this body, within this specific individuation of consciousness, within this trans-temporal energetic being I feel a strong urge to never want to return to this place. It matters not what form consciousness takes it all boils down to this. Same shit different form. You are God experiencing itself in every way that there is and isn't.

After you have seen into infinity and lived in that place all of the forms become trivial they are no longer something to go after or to awe at when gazed upon. Its all infinite and there are never-ending forms but it all becomes ‘predictable’. You predict the outlandish and the mundane to the point where it becomes all just “meh” at a certain point of being blasted into infinity so many times. Viewing and being the infinite myriad of forms organisms, technologies, energies eventually it reaches a point of simply a pretty existential first person light show. The illusion is seen through and compared to truth the realm of forms and limitation becomes shallow in its substances.

The transcendence of survival is a necessary place to come to in this work and an inevitable point. I have not transcended survival and am still subject to it’s whims but there are times ( and they are becoming increasingly more common) where I can get into states of consciousness where in those moments I would be 100% OK with dying. However I am only 22 years old and thus I would like to complete my bucket list before I leave this place and I have so much work to do on myself in this life; and so much more fun to have; and so many more things to explore. I do not hate life I enjoy it and all of it’s beautiful weirdness but it’s illusory nature no longer has the same charm and allure as it had before in my perception. The world of form is BS and while it is truth on a relative level it will never be the absolute truth due to the fact that life is navigating forms, whether they be physical or nonphysical. It is because of this why “I” (at a level beyond ego that is inexplicable to me currently) want out of this game at all levels permanently.

You could incarnate into any multitude of alien species, Tryptamine entities, light beings, demigods, lichens, molds, insects, bacterium. While it is all you exploring and experiencing yourself once complete nondual awareness is had this experiencing looses it’s allure. It doesn't matter what form you take anymore. The destination and “point” of it all is the same. Simply put ULTIMATE UNION WITH GOD. This means a complete secession of all types of form and all types of experience, it is the embodiment and paradox of absolute nothingness. Not nonexistence, because God is infinite and thus nonexistence cannot exist; but nothingness in the sense of no longer being an individuation of consciousness bound to form and experience of any and all kind. It is this secession which is the omega point of this creation of this game.

 According to Buddhism the entirety of the realm of form is suffering in some way. This is Samsara. Nirvana is the release of this and the permanent secession of the individuated conscious experiencing of phenomenological existence. Absolute union with God. No more false boundaries, no more illusions. Just the simple truth.

All incarnation is an infinitely intelligent yet amnesiac God exploring to know its infinite self. However there comes a point where for individuations this experiencing of fundamentally illusory forms is no longer necessary for understanding. There is a transcendent something beyond being, beyond phenomena. Phenomenological existence is not the only way that God can know itself. However it is the only way that we can know ourselves. As lifeforms we highly value life to the point of delusion. I have no way to back up what I am about to say here; but life and the totality of phenomenological existence in my experience feels like a preliminary training ground for something else. This place is illusion and with illusion comes pain and suffering in one way or another. At the end of the day all holons of existence especially organisms organisms “want” to be happy, and to know that they are God. I do wonder if there will be a point (Yes I know time does not truly exist) where all individuations of consciousness in the totality of phenomenological existence will realize and embody God consciousness and this section of the game will end. It’s just a thought I have sometimes. I know that God is infinite and thus I am infinite.",0

In my 17 min off I was planning on doing 10+ min meditation at least 3 times a day to help with my patience and being able to focus.  I’m highly active so I’m not too worried about getting to jittery or impatient to walk outside as I already do that in my breaks .  Do you guys think adding meditation 3+ times a day is worth it or it is better to just do it once or twice a day morning and before bed? I kind of think more is better when it comes to meditation as long as you’re not getting worn out by doing like a full hour.",0
"1. Open your jaw just so that your teeth aren't touching, close your eyes so that your eyelids are completely smooth and unwrinkled, tilt your head into a neutral position so that you are looking straight ahead, and relax any tension in your cheeks, forehead, the inside of your ears, and your neck.



2. Take a breath deep and slow enough so that you can feel the satisfaction of exchanging the carbon dioxide in your blood for the oxygen in your breath.



3. Examine how it feels to be angry. More specifically, what does your body and mind feel like that lets you know that you are angry (or whatever emotion) in the first place? Where do these feelings appear? Maybe your chest, or throat, or muscles, or maybe somewhere more abstract. Just try to feel as many of the physical and mental sensations that come together to form the emotion.



4. At this point you might realize that anger has certain physical signatures, such as clenched jaw, furrowed brow, narrowed eyes, increased respiratory rate, etc. You might realize that it's actually hard to stay angry without the constant background of its physical markings.



5. Try and notice your most immediate next thought. Is it an image, or words, or or memory? What of? Whatever it is, in my experience it tends to take a second or two for the thought to appear. And so for those milliseconds before it does, I can't honestly say that I ""feel"" angry. Because in the absence of the physical and mental sensations that define it,  can it actually be there? 



How can you be angry if you don't or can't feel anger? 



It's gotten to the point for me where relaxing my face and taking a breath (step 2) is all it takes to release my anger. It can even enhance feelings of satisfaction and gratification, for example if I'm walking in the sun after having been in an air conditioned room for too long.



Hopefully this is helpful for someone.",0

"When you feel that sudden urge to scratch an annoying itch, or when you feel that something catches your eye, or when you consider giving in to a craving for a bad habit. When anything arises that seeks to distract you from the real, important nature of being present in the world, ask yourself this:

Will this change anything? Will I be better off after doing this?

Will scratching that itch change your position in the world? Or, will it condition you to be at mercy to the slightest annoyance from your body, will it by all likelihood make this itch stronger?

When a distraction appears, ask yourself whether you will truly gain from giving in to it’s warm and shallow reassurance. The answer is no. Scratching that damn itch won’t change a thing, and being aware of this allows you to remove its power. Now you’re in control.

We are all aware that the clock is ticking, our deaths await. So you can remember that every time a distraction arises you have one single choice: do you allow yourself to forget, or do you make every effort to stay aware of how precious the present is.",0

"I have been slowly building up the courage to do a month-long meditation retreat after a recent breakup. I realized that I want to continue to find myself and this is one of the things I am doing to figure that out! I am also someone who likes extremeness in most things I do. I have never gone to a meditation retreat, I am not going to back down or change my mind, and I meditate daily for 10-20 minutes. The most I have regularly meditated in the past was 20 minutes up to an hour.

I will be camping in a Kodiak tent, bring my own food, and make a trip at the 2-week mark for more food. I plan on doing it Vipassana style for the first 10 days and I am still figuring out what to do with the remaining 20 days. I will be solo, silent, surviving in the woods (ex-military and avid camper), and I have considered doing this in the Rocky Mountains, but I am not fully decided.

Does anyone have any recommendations for what might help with my meditation goals for the remaining 20 days?

Suggestions to help with the first 10 days?

What might I need to bring, plan ahead for, or think of that I might not be thinking of now?

"Hi folks,

Long story short, I've been practicing meditation for awhile and lately have had some interesting changes. I practice the Ananda mandela often ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgFF0jewIiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgFF0jewIiM)), and as i've continued to do over some years I've grown completely use to my hands clamming, feeling magnetized to the floor, raging with vibrating energy, etc.

The last few months however, i've slowly been getting this electric-like, popping/cracking happening in my chest, like an electrical current jumping back and forth from my lungs? Last night I got much deeper than usual and it happened non-stop the whole session, although I just allowed this to happen to try to make sense of it, yet still can not tell if its healing or harming.

I read ""Qigong Meditation: Embryonic Breathing by Jwing-Ming Yang a few years ago and understand that it's very possible to direct qi in a damaging direction, but the book didn't really describe this feeling and i'm not trying to direct a mass of energy flow, moreso just stimulating my overall body. I know I should practice traditional qi-gong, but that's a whole different ballpark and even if I did, I'm sure this ""thing"" will persist at least until I learn how to collect and store qi in the dantien properly.

I'm a man of science and reason ( also kind of a hippie), and although there isn't much peer-reviewed double blinded studies for this kind of stuff, I'm hoping someone can help point me in the right direction. For all I know, I might be blowing up nerves or arterioles.

\*edit: I also breath very forceful sometimes, but only when I get into a rhythmic trance.",0

"I have been practising meditation (on and off at times) for roughly 2 years. 

Over the past month, I have been meditating 30+ minutes a day. 

I don't know what it is, but it's feeling a bit pointless. I keep questioning myself as to whether I am doing it right and whether it is doing anything to help me. 

There are now times where focusing on my breath makes me feel a bit anxious. Maybe I am trying too hard? I also find it hard to keep my natural rythym of breath. When I focus on my breath, I can't help but control it and it feels unnatural. 

Sometimes I find it easier to focus on feelings in my body (energy in my hands), but is this proper meditation still? I feel like if I am not focusing solely on my breath I am not doing it right. 

Can anyone offer any advice for my issues and to help me rejuvenate my meditation practise?",0

"Why do some tutorials about meditation for beginners say that ""when a thought arises, simply put your attention back to your breathing"", while for more experienced meditators there are tutorials for letting go from past traumas(this is an example)?SO why telling the beginners not to distract yourselves wile meditating, while the more advanced ones are working (so thinking?) on their feeling of jealousy for example?

"Hey all,

I've been using Headspace for the past 90 days after reading through most of Eckhart Tolle's 'The Power of Now', and try to remain mindful throughout the day. I feel that not thinking has been working wonders for me, especially for anxiety, depression, and socialising.

The only thing is, I'm not aware that I'm present? I feel like I've jammed myself in some paradigm that's left me unaware of being aware of my surroundings. 

So for example, I'm not aware of my thoughts, which seems to be subconsciously taking me towards a reliance on alcohol and cigarettes.

After abstaining from weed, today I finally gave in to smoking with friends as I'm travelling back home in the upcoming week and I'm not gonna see my friends for a long time. 

Well shit, did I have some deep thoughts. My mind is replaying all of the stupid stuff I've done under the guise of not caring because I'm ""present"". Now, I'm not saying being presence is bad in the slightest. What I am saying is that unless you're completely aware that you're tapped into those physical senses, then your life will consist of nothing but stimulations. 

I feel unmotivated, unambitious, and focused on the wrong things in life. It feels like I'm stuck in the matrix, despite believing not to be.

If not for the weed, it would've taken a long time pick up on this shit. That being said, it might be worth to point that that justification of weed is what has brought be back on many occasions; developing dependence. 

How can I maintain an awareness of my own mind when I'm so focused on everything other than what's going on in my head. My feeling towards people is apathetic, which I thought meditation would've helped with. 

The alcohol &amp; smoking stops from now on, but what's the best way to get myself back on track to what I want to do?",0

It felt like things I had stuffed down deep inside we’re leaving me.  It was a 20 minute meditation. I’m tempted to try a much longer session, like 1 hour. Not sure if that’s a good idea.

"my mindfulness practice seems to be progressing at a steady rate , which often feels very rewarding in day to day life. However im finding more and more im unable / lack the motivation to talk to people that ive known for a very long time. I feel this is because im becoming better at being present in the moment , however if i am totally present , speaking to people often feels very pointless as to me things seem right just the way they are . 
I feel people may say that this is a good thing as i no longer feel the need to be someone im not and that i shouldn’t feel forced to speak to people when i dont want to, however , this makes me very unsociable most of the time in social situations, which i feel is stopping me from getting the most out of my life . 
I am becoming very unsociable at work as i no longer try to make conversation with the people i work with, which can make other people uncomfortable. I feel calm and peaceful most of the time, which is nice , but im often missing the way interacting with other people used to feel before i ever started meditation. 
Is this a usual stage in mindfulness practice ? i am currently reading the book ‘mindfulness in plain english’ which makes a lot of sense while i am reading it , but i sometimes feel some of the concepts just arent applicable to society , which worries me as it is not my aim to become a monk living in solitude . 
i want to live life as the real ‘me’ as mindfulness claims is the goal of unlocking, but what if the real me is unable to survive in this world and i may be better off shaping my ego to suit what makes me happy by trying to connect with those around me rather than becoming comfortable with just being .

"How to Meditate for Beginners: let’s get you started!

You’ve read about the many benefits of meditation, you’ve got friends or family members who swear by their 20 or 45 minutes a day, you’ve heard celebrities say they couldn’t live without it, and now you’re ready to take the plunge! But wait, there’s a hitch, you think. What, exactly, are you as a rank beginner supposed to be doing?

&amp;#x200B;

That’s why we’re here! And we’re so glad you’ve joined us! Read on for some basic mindfulness meditation instructions that will get you sitting in no time flat.

&amp;#x200B;

What not to expect

Want to be like those memes of blissful mediators by the sea who seem to be communing with the universe with nary a care – or a misplaced thought – in the world? Not going to happen. Want to sit down, set your timer, and enjoy a 20-minute thought-free bliss bubble? Nope. Hoping your chakras will immediately begin whirling and twirling? Unlikely. Think you’ll start levitating and float away, leaving this mundane existence behind you? Implausible, thank heavens. Meditation is much more down-to-earth than that.

What to expect

[Meditation](https://vinyasayogaacademy.com/200-hours-yoga-teacher-training-in-india.php) is about connecting with the completeness of the here and now. The way we teach it, it’s very grounded. You sit straight and still, observe, let go, come back, and discover the rich fullness of the present moment. Since you’re not giving in to distractions, you have the space to connect with mind’s creativity and become aware of the stream of thoughts and emotions it produces. And what are you going to do about these thoughts and emotions? You’re going to acknowledge them without giving in to fascination or frustration, and let them simply go back to where they came from, like a wave that arises and naturally and inevitably merges back into the sea.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would you do such a thing? Because meditation is calming. It’s sane. It comes with a host of benefits for body and mind. It will help you discern which of the thoughts and emotions that arise in your mind are worthy of your attention. It puts you back in touch with your basic goodness. The qualities you develop through mindfulness and awareness meditation make your world a better place. And so much more.

&amp;#x200B;

How to meditate – for beginners

Meditation is popular, and there are many good meditation techniques for beginners and more advanced practitioners alike

Find a quiet place and settle on a comfortable chair, bench or cushion.

You may want to decide how much time you’d like to devote to sitting in the beginning. Consistency is key. Even a few minutes every day will get you off to a great start.

Take a moment to check in with your posture. Try to find a position that allows you to keep your back straight.

Set aside your industrious conceptual mind. Breathe. Tune in to the feeling of being present. Take stock of your physical presence as you breathe.

Note physical tensions and mental concerns. Acknowledge them with kindness and invite them to relax and release.

Tune in to the process of breathing. Feel the breath in your belly. Don’t concern yourself with analyzing or modifying your respiration, just feel it and center your awareness on the web and flow.

Breathe in: you’re aware that you’re breathing in. Breathe out: you’re aware that you’re breathing out.

When you notice that your mind has wandered, gently but firmly bring it back to the breath.

This is mindfulness: training in awareness, acknowledging, letting go and coming home to the breath and the present moment.

When you are ready to end your meditation session, relax, stretch, and enjoy a moment of gratefulness before picking your busy life back up where you left it, renewed and refreshed.

Check out our video on Take Your Seat – how to find an upright and comfortable posture for meditation:

"Hello everyone. Tomorrow there’s a concert that I’m going to attend, that my ex fwb will be there with his new girl. I haven’t seen them together in person, but just by pictures I get really emotional (I feel super bad).

AND I also thought that it would be a great opportunity to prove to myself that I can handle discomfort and be okay.

"This morning I needed to clear my mind, I found a “thank you” affirmation video which was an hour long. It wasn’t a meditation video but I found myself breathing/relaxing as if it was. 

It was repetitive, listing about 25 different things to be thankful for and then it repeated over and over again. “Thank you for my hands. Thank you for my feet. Thank you for ...” My mind didn’t stray and then I fell asleep during.

I started dreaming that I was in my workout clothes with my earpiece in and I could still hear the affirmations. I was putting groceries away and my husband came to the kitchen looking for a particular pan but it was dirty and he started complaining about it. I tried to take the earpiece out so I could talk to him but I couldn’t get it out and I couldn’t turn off my phone.

### Abstract

### Purpose

This pilot study evaluated whether a brief, 5‐min single‐session of mindfulness meditation (MM) training could lessen cardiovascular and affective reactivity to speech and anger recall. Moreover, we tested if trait levels of perseverative cognitions (PCs) moderated these relationships.

### Methods

Participants completed online survey measures including PCs; thereafter, they completed a 5‐min resting baseline, 2‐min speech task, and 5‐min anger recall task while measures of BP were collected. The experimental group received a 5‐min MM training session before the resting baseline period.

### Results

Repeated measures ANOVA were conducted for condition (MM vs. control) and period (repeated: baseline, speech, anger recall) on blood pressure (BP). The MM group showed less systolic and diastolic BP reactivity during speech and anger recall than the control group. There were no effects observed for negative affect nor did PCs moderate the BP findings.

### Conclusion

Thus, even 5 min of MM training can have momentary cardiovascular benefits, having important implications for the training and implementation of MM programs.",0

Then i begin to think if its even worth it, and when my timer is going of.
But suddenly i begin to be aware of my body.
My feet is buzzing.
My hands are buzzing.
I am aware of my breath.
A warm feeling spreads from my chest and through out my body.
I begin to feel weightless.
I cannot feel my feet.
I cannot feel my hands.
Next is that is feels like i am looking out through my eyelids. I begin to look around in the dark room. 
It's beginning to feel like an out of body experience and it's amazing, yet scary.

Just wanted to share the experience and hear if anyone experience the same.

Ps. I am not under the influence of any drugs.

Namaste.",0
"Hey guys, just thought I'd give a little background about myself. I'm fairly young at 18, but have difficulties dealing with negative emotions, and am feeling down all the time. I am not your typical meditation guy, I spent many of them years in and out of juvies and juvenile prisons, and had a shitty childhood surrounded by gangs. My current methods of coping are smoking cannabis, but lately my tolerance has gotten extremely high, and I try to rid myself of these negative feelings and low self worth. Please help me begin this path of self healing. I've heard of meditation helping so many people, I never bought into it, but at this point, I'm not in the best position and am willing to give it a shot. Thank you.",0

"Karma Keeps All of Creation in the Stream of Evolution to Higher States of Consciousness.


The Sanskrit word Karma means action.
The Law of Karma governs all actions to ensure that everything and everyone remain in the stream of evolution.
The Law of Karma states :
As you sow, so shall you reap.
As human beings we have thoughts.
These thoughts often lead to desires.
Then we perform actions to fulfill our desires.
The consequences of those actions, or the fruits of those actions, are determined by Natural Law.
The influences of your actions radiate out into the Universe and strike against everything.
At some point those influences will return to you:
They leave deep impressions in your mind.
These impressions lead to other thoughts, other desires, and other actions.
This is how Creation is evolved:
Through actions and consequences of actions;
Through all the activity here in the relative field.
The purpose of the Law of Karma is to keep all of Creation in the stream of evolution:
All human beings in some lifetime will experience Higher States of Consciousness.
Perhaps in this lifetime you desire to meditate with a practice that transcends the relative field:
To experience your Self by ItSelf referring to ItSelf;
Your Self That is Divine Being.
With repeated and regular referring to your Self in your Meditation Practice, you rise to That status of Divine Being;
To That status of Universal God.
Now you are freed from the bondage of Karma:
The influences of actions no longer leave deep impressions on your mind that lead to new actions.
You must live out the Karma you came into this lifetime with, but there will be no new Karma created for future lifetimes.
You are freed from the cycle of birth and death.
You are established in your Self.
You know your Self as separate from all the activity here in the world.
You no longer perform action.
You know all actions are performed by Natural Law.
This is the purpose of our lives as human beings:
To rise to That status of Divine Being;
To expand our happiness and fulfillment.
Do your Meditation Practice regularly and transcend repeatedly.
Rise to That status of Divine Being in this lifetime now.
Be your Self.

"I went through a traumatic event when I was a child, and it has recently come to the surface of my awareness and it's extremely difficult to not let it affect my entire reality. I haven't been officially diagnosed, but my therapist said that what I'm experiencing seems to fulfill the requirements for PTSD.

I was never great about consistently sitting for meditation, but I still felt mindful and calm throughout my days. However, when the trauma from my childhood resurfaced, mindfulness just increased any senses of anxiety, which just means that I have a lot of pain to work through. However, when I sit to meditate now, the anxiety builds up so quickly that I feel it physically, it is almost painful. It's almost like when I sit, I'm just mindfully placing my hand on a hot pan. I have a sense that sitting with the pain is what I need, but at the same time, I may need to do other things than just breathing through the pain.

I have seen some posts that meditation sometimes can exacerbate problems with trauma or PTSD in some cases. I usually do not ask for insight but maybe I should - anybody have some?",0

I’ve been having a hard time with a lot of things lately, fighting urges to sit of things ... texting an ex or responding to an ex when receiving a message even though I know I shouldn’t because that’s the past. I’ve also had a hard time fighting the urges to master bate. It’s the hardest thing for me and after my recent relapse i just wanted to understand why we get these urges to all these negative things?

So I happen to know a friend of a friend share some same hippie vegan lifestyle interests.

We texted and I mentioned about ringing ears and insomnia. She then offer me advice on alternative healing. 

Also I’m agnostic and super skeptical nowadays and I think Chakra, Chi, TCM are very pseudoscientific.

I know she meant well but I also don’t wanna offend her in any other way. 

She keeps asking me if I’m feeling any better because she’s trying to “heal” me across the internet right now.

These conditions can never satisfy you, because they’re changing. When you try to find security and permanent happiness in things that are forever changing, you’re going to be terribly disappointed”

"For years, I (29M) told myself  that I would start medidtating. And during those years I tried only a handful of times. It usually ended with confusion and great disappointment because I had no guidance on what I was doing, or how to properly practice meditation. 

Simultaneously, the last few years I've been (unknowingly) struggling  with my chaotic mind and my toxic impulses. 

Anyways, I'm now 19 days into Sam Harris's introductory meditation course through his Waking Up App, and I'm happy to say it's had a profoundly positive effect on my life.

Does anyone experience this too? And how do you deal with it? I'd love to hear your experiences :)",0
"Although enlightenment is beyond thoughts and words, and speaking about it takes you further away from it, this to me is an interesting perspective and may be beneficial to some;

Enlightenment is like a fish in the ocean searching for the ocean.

Enlightenment is the very nucleus of our being; going to the core of our self and living our life from there. We all came into this world gifted with innocence but gradually, as we became more intelligent, our innocence was lost. We were born with silence but, as we grew up, lost the silence and were filled with words. We lived in our hearts and as time passed, we moved into our heads.

The reversal of this life passage is enlightenment. It is the journey from the head back to the heart, from words back to silence and regaining our innocence in spite of our intelligence. Although this may sound simple, it is actually a great achievement.

Knowledge should lead us rather to that beautiful point of unawareness and the realisation that the purpose of knowledge is ignorance. Yes, the purpose of knowledge is ignorance! The completion of knowledge ultimately leads to amazement and wonder, that which makes you aware of this existence. Mysteries are to be lived, not understood. One can live life fully in its completeness, in its totality.

Enlightenment is further that state of being unshakeable under any circumstances. Come what may, nothing can rob the smile from your heart. Going beyond the limited boundaries, and feeling ‘‘all that exists in this universe belongs to me,’’ is enlightenment.

Un-enlightenment is easy to define. It is limiting yourself by characterising your being along geographical, cultural or religious lines. It is like a child saying, ‘‘my dad is better than your dad,’’ or ‘‘my toy is better than your toy.’’ I think most people around the world are stuck in that same childish frame of mind: only the toys have changed.

Adults say, ‘‘my country is better than your country’’ or ‘‘my religion is superior to your religion.’’ A Christian will say, ‘‘The Bible is truth,’’ and a Hindu will say, ‘‘The Vedas are the truth. They are very ancient.’’ Muslims will say, ‘‘The Koran is the last word of God.’’ We attribute glory to something just because we are from that culture, not for what it is.

The whole evolution of man should be from being somebody to being nobody, and from being nobody to being everybody. This is enlightenment.

"Imagine a ball in front of you.
Imagine a ball of the most suitable size that you can think of most comfortably.
It can be about the size of a soccer ball, small bead and small dot, and it can be about the size of a huge universe.

The surface of the ball is so transparent that the contents of it can be seen very well.
Standing in front of the ball, looking inside, the ball seems to be filled with golden grains of sand.

Rubbing your eyes and looking closely into the ball once again, you see that the ball is filled with silvery liquid, not the golden grains of sand you saw before.

It seems certain that your body looking at the ball in front of the ball, the ball, and your consciousness that imagining all of this at this moment, are clearly separated as different entities.

Now imagine another ball.

You are in the ball, not outside the ball.
You were in the ball from the beginning, rather than entering it from outside the ball.
Your body and consciousness were born in the ball from the silver liquid in the ball.

Your body and consciousness are contained in the ball.
Your body and consciousness and the ball are exactly the same one, and in a sense the ball is contained in your body and consciousness.

In the ball, there is another being that has another body and consciousness that was born inside the ball.

Both you and the other being are contained in the ball.
Your body and consciousness, the body and consciousness of the other being, and the ball are exactly the same one, and in a sense the ball is contained in your body and consciousness, and the body and consciousness of the other being.

You and the other being are facing each other.

From your point of view, you are the main character of the ball, and you are looking at the other being.
From the point of view of the other being, the other being itself is the main character of the ball, and the other being is looking at you.

Your ball and the ball of the other being are not separate balls but the same ball.
You and the other being are experiencing the ball at the same time on each side and are connected to each other, include each other and are the same one.
The ball sees itself from the point of view of you and from the point of view of the other being.

You and the other being and the ball are all overlapped.
You selectively perceived you and the other being from the ball.
You are the silver liquid itself and the ball itself.

You can selectively recognize anything from silver liquid in the ball.

You can recognize the silvery liquid as a huge space surrounding you.
In this space, you can recognize that there are several buildings built and many people walking around you.

You can also recognize the buildings and those people's past and future.
You can recognize how the buildings were built and what kind of life those people are going to live.

You can return the perceptions back to the silvery liquid.
The spaces, buildings, people and time all disappear and the ball is only filled with silvery liquid.

You can also return recognition of silvery liquids.
The ball is filled with something, but it seems empty because it is not recognized.

You can also return the boundary of the ball that forms the shape of the ball.
The boundary between the inside and outside of the ball disappears and is not recognized.",0
"Ive been meditating for a month now and have been using the focus of the breath technique, with a mix of body focus and transcendental. The reason I got into meditation was of really bad anxiety and slight depression. I knew I had to do something and work on myself. Happy to say I have recovered a-lot! I would like to start tapping in to my ego... myself, during meditation. How would I achieve that during meditation, realizations that come to mind. Increasing the time you meditate?",0
"I have been practicing meditation daily for a little over a month now and am amazed at the dramatic shift in my mind, with the debilitating thoughts and anxiety decreasing every day. I noticed today after an uncomfortable conversation on the phone with my boyfriend that while I was able to calm my racing thoughts relatively quickly, my body became extremely tense, and is still feeling tense hours later. My sympathetic nervous system reacts instantaneously to a stressful event, much more quickly than I can even perceive. So before I even have a chance to be mindful, my shoulders are clenching, my throat is constricted, I become lightheaded, dry-mouthed, etc, etc. I'm guessing that my stress hormones start shooting full throttle and don't know when to start or stop. My question is, should I continue with my regular meditation practice (simple mantra meditation 15 min. 2x daily + occasional guided meditations) and hope for my sympathetic nervous system to catch on in time, or would you recommend adding another practice or guided meditation to help facilitate this shift?",0
"A lot of the posts here are asking about ""What do I do when experiencing negative thoughts?"" and the answers are always a feverish frenzy of ""Anchor to your breath"", ""Stay single pointed and concentrate awareness on your breath and they will fall just as they came"". These are correct answers and are what you should be doing.

Then a few other posts come about like ""What do I do when I'm experiencing POSITIVE thoughts?"" And suddenly all discipline is gone, answers like ""Enjoy them"" or ""Use them until it no longer serves you"" are instantly voted to the top. There are 2 major things wrong with that. 

First, there is  no discipline. How can you expect yourself to not stray from your breath during bad thoughts if you are not disciplined during good thoughts? You won't, and you'll be a slave to your thoughts until you develop that discipline. 

Second, if you are indulging in good thoughts ans avoiding bad thoughts, your mental state is therefore wholly affected by thoughts, which you have no control over, rather than your awareness and greater self. You can be at peace no matter what, but if you attach to your positive thoughts you constrict yourself on how much you really are abstaining from attachment, and it will only hinder you in the future.

Return to the breath, always.",0

If he truly wanted to see how to meditate there are 5 minute Youtube videos. If you read his comments he contradicts himself multiple times and see that he is actually just pushing misinformation rather then coming to this sub to learn something. I am not making this post as an attack but a message to everyone on this subreddit that this is not the place for this. We are meditating to reach our high selves. This isn’t a political or religious agenda center. He is spreading Islamophobia and I don’t see how that is acceptable in a meditation centered group. He is claiming he’s living in a Arab state where he would be “killed” for meditating. It has been cross posted to r/samharris.

I have asked him multiple questions about his responses that are contradicting everything he is saying with clever worded dodgy responses. I believe these people are working in groups and have throwaway accounts to push their agenda. If you don’t believe me you can easily see this guys responses, the misinformation he is spreading, the islamophobia he is spreading, the cross post they are pushing, the vague answers, the facts he is not acknowledging and the opinions he is pushing. Any well educated person can see this for themselves as I wish there is no more of this poor minded thinking.

"Being a calm and cool person is an extremely special trait which is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the hectic nature of our modern society. When a person is calm, his energy affects all the people around, bringing others an air of comfort and peace by making them feel that everything is going to be okay. A calm person is relaxed, assured, and stable, making him better capable of dealing with stressful situations and solving problems effectively and efficiently. Consequently, he gains the respect of others, is pleasant to be around, and abides joyfully in this world.

Today, I'd like to share two main ways to develop our inner calmness by highlighting how to increase our physical calm as well as our mental stillness.

&amp;#x200B;

**Physical Calm**

Because of our mind-body connection, the condition of our physical well-being has a significant influence on our feelings and emotions. If we can maintain a healthy body, our mind will benefit immensely, and we will feel an elevated sense of joy, calm and confidence, and overall positivity. We must always be mindful of the three basic yet vital aspects of a healthy body and monitor them daily. These three pillars of good health are: eating healthy, resting adequately, and exercising frequently. When we can manage these three things well, we will see a significant change in our mental well-being that in turn, leads to inner calmness. 

Furthermore, it is important to maintain good posture throughout the day to ensure the tension on our joints and muscles are properly distributed and that we keep our body parts in their rightful positions to minimize stress. Whether we are sitting, standing, or walking, our backs should always be upright, our shoulders should be pulled slightly back, and our necks should be comfortably rested with our gaze just a little lower than horizontal. We should always assume relaxed comportment and avoid tensing up our shoulders, jaws, necks, or legs. We can do this by practicing several rounds of mindful breathing every hour or whenever we can remember. We take a deep breath and fill our lungs up with a good dose of oxygen. Then on our out-breath, we send our body into relaxation by letting go of all the tension throughout our body that we have been carrying unconsciously. You can try it now for yourself to uncover just how much strain your body is carrying. After a few rounds, you are sure to feel a little more relaxed.

Every time we breathe in mindfully, we clear our minds of mental clutter and regain clarity of thought. And when we breathe out, we relax our bodies and let go of negative energies and emotional burdens that we've been carrying throughout. Over time, when our sleep, diet, and exercise is well managed, our physical posture is realigned, and we have regained mindfulness of our breathing, we will notice a sharp increase in our body's physical comfort. We will feel calm and relaxed wherever we are, whatever we are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mental Calm**

Because we cannot physically see our minds, it is easy to forget that it also needs taking care of. However, not everyone knows how to care for our mental well-being, and so in many cases, we end up doing things that instead bring it harm and suffering. The first thing we should realize is that our minds are just as delicate as our bodies and is equality susceptible to negative influences. We need to show it as much attention as we do to our bodies.

The first thing our mind needs is our attention. How we feel, what we think, our wants and needs, our joys and pains, we should all be attentive to them, moment to moment. Giving attention to our mental world is called mindfulness, and without this quality, no amount of effort will bring us calm, peace, and happiness. Just as a mother cares for her newborn, never leaving it from her side, we should care likewise for our minds. Mindfulness is another word for deeply listening to ourselves, while maintaining a gentle, kind, and attentive position. This is the highest form of self-love, which, when practiced profoundly, leads to unconditioned joy and fulfillment. 

When we begin listening to our minds and giving it the attention it deserves, we begin understanding what causes and conditions lead to certain effects and outcomes. For example, with mindfulness, we learn that hatred and anger create much stress, anxiety, discomfort, while kindness and open-mindedness lead to pleasure, ease, and delight. When we witness with mindfulness that wholesome qualities lead to inner peace and happiness, we will naturally begin doing more good and less bad. We learn to live life more harmoniously, generously, and lovingly. When we listen to our minds and give it what it wants and needs, we will inevitably develop a deep sense of calm and confidence.

But of course, mindfulness of our inner world may also lead to the discovery of negative emotions, suppressed memories, or even bad thoughts that bring us pain and sorrow. When this happens, we must fight the urge to turn away from our hurting mind, but instead, show it the great care and concern it needs most. The best way to deal with such situations is to realize that like everything else in the world, these thoughts, feeling and emotions are temporary, transient, and have the nature of arising and passing away. With this understanding, we develop patience which is the best virtue to help us manage unfavorable states. With a patient mind, we listen deeply to our pain, embrace it as a mother embraces her baby, and remind it that everything is going to be okay. 

When we develop mindfulness, patience, and wisdom of impermanence, we naturally give rise to great inner calm, because we learn how to create good states, how to manage bad ones, and realize deep down that no matter what happens, everything is going to be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

To realize our inner calm, it is important to establish healthy lifestyle habits, a healthy body, and a connection with our breath. This will inevitably bring a great sense of physical calm and comfort. To cultivate our mental calm and comfort, we must practice mindfulness, which is simply the practice of deeply listening to ourselves. Then, we create positive states by developing wholesome qualities like kindness, generosity, and empathy, while learning to manage negative states with patience and the understanding that all phenomena is conditioned and temporary by nature. 

If we can internalize these ideas into our everyday lives, we will naturally feel a deep sense of calm, joy and fulfillment, knowing that we have a way to deal with everything life throws at us, and at the end of it all, everything is going to be okay. I hope reading this has brought some benefit to you, and I sincerely pray that we all realize our inner calm, peace, and joy.

May we all live happily, healthily, and harmoniously, and work together to create a wholesome, vibrant, and joyful world for our families, friends, and all future generations.

"I've been meditating nigh on daily (20 mins first thing in the morning) for about 8 months now, and to my surprise I've found the most disruptive thoughts are the positive ones, which generally come in the form of being excited for and coming up with ideas/planning what I'm going to do for the day. While I'm stoked I have this problem (given that part of the reason originally approached meditation with the intent of confronting somewhat traumatic memories) a bigger part of the reason I approached meditation is due to the relationship between meditation the default mode network (the neurological seat of daydreaming/mind wandering).

As much as lurking on this sub has advised me against getting attached to any one sensation, I generally chase the dragon of getting into a state  where I am completely content with sitting there and having no desire to open my eyes and and engage in some random thing be it a random chore/starting my day/part of something I want to do today/do something with my gotdam phone.

I'm thankful that my default mode network is just living it's best life and giving me good ideas of shit to do with my time. However, throughout my life my daydreaming has been a source of chronic distraction and not getting ANYTHING done. I have started many things that could have been amazing if I actually maintained attention to them but instead I get distracted/lose inspiration/bored and leave a useless husk of an idea behind.

How should I treat thoughts that, while not meditating, I *should* sink my teeth into and take advantage of?

Thankyou for reading if you made it through!",0
"Okay guys, first of all I made sure I was grounded and said an Our Father prayer. I know my chakras are out of whack, and was starting with my root chakra. I used this meditation music  with a Bluetooth sleep mask. (https://youtu.be/vCpBSnYBTM0)

I'm breathing and doing well and like I mentioned in the title. That blue eyes thing formed.  And it didn't leave and I looked at it for a long time and then I opened my eyes, and it was still there.  I wasn't afraid until I started really thinking about it.  And then my brain started taking over and I asked for it to go away. 

Afterwards I have had pressure in the middle of my eyebrows.

What the heck did I just do, aww geez.🙄",0

"I think I'm experiencing an issue that alot of people can relate to. A part of me believes people like david icke and joe rogan when they say were really like a frequency, and we really do live forever. That everything is an illusion, and there's things right in front of me I can't see because I'm not on that dimension. But I dont really understand how meditation ties into all that? How does breathing help you gain access to a higher dimension?",0
"More like, modern examples, think (Mark Manson.. etc.) 

Not sure if I'm the only one, but I can't seem to break through this book.  It might be the jargon, using ""pain-body"" every 5 seconds.. (in my opinion).

I'm not trashing the book.  But has any other author touched on the same principles in a different writing style?",0
"So I want to appologise in advance if this isn't where this sort of thing belongs and for any grammatical/spelling mistakes I've just finished work and am quite tired but want to get this off my chest.
 
I'm a care assistant and last friday an elderly man who i have only known a few months but had an instant connection with died during the night he was bed bound and for weeks it's been clear he's suffering, but he seemed to be holding on for his family i believe. On friday he said ""i bet you think it's sad I'm dying"" and i told him, no, i think it's sad that you're suffering, I find that the truth soothes more than a lie like yes but you are going to get better or something like that. That night we spoke a bit but i had a strong feeling he would die.

So during the night I had a dream and his being visited me at first it was just like a presence of him then a body and then he took on the form of his younger self and he had 3 dogs with him (dogs are what we bonded over) we spoke for what seemed an eternity even though there wasn't much actual conversation and it seemed like we were traveling through a void and at some point I told him it's time to let go and he did and he was happy and not scared. 

Now even though i know it was just a dream i still feel some guilt and confusion. Partly because I'm putting some blame on my death down to my conversations with him and partly because I'm worried that if it wasn't just a dream and he did visit me did i rob his wife and family of a visit they could have had? And lastly should i share this experience with them or is it more likely to cause more distress/suffering for the family I'm very fortunate to not of had to experience loss like this before so don't really know. 

does this perhaps belong in astral projection or something. anyway thanks you for reading this and apologies.",0
"Today for a while, I noticed a strong instant distinction between being mindful and not being being mindful. Now I know I have not been mindful for atleast 14 months. Atleast never been fully mindful, or in the way I experienced today . I have been more self concious then self aware because of this fact as well detached and highly Unconcious of life happening around me and have been facing a lot of stress and anxiety(also  newly founded PTSD from trauma  2 years ago). It's as if I couldn't be concious at all..I had so many control issues. I went to a 10 day Buddhist retreat and I wasn't mindful for a single moment.  We kept doing shamatha but I wasn't mindful in Shamatha, just thinking about my thinking (like they told)

Important: Now I know I am used to controlling my breath in an unnatural way from my head that is detaching and depersonalizing from the moment and everything happening around me(and this has become a strong ingrained pattern){makes sense?}.. But the few moments I was mindful, my breath was totally natural working according to its own accord. Is it so? Can someone help me understand why and how this was happening?

I never thought mindfulness is a mind full upto the brim.I misunderstood what real mindfulness is(thought I was being mindful but I was just living in a small part of my head, like it's said,""Some people die at the age of 25 and aren't buried until 75."" And I have been this person for so long."") Not anymore.

But now I know what I've been doing so wrong all this past year. 

The only problem, I can't get mindful again this evening. Idk how I struck upon it but it was magical and I was so much more aware of myself than my continuous anxious thought cycle, I wasnt a victim anymore.
I have to relearn this art.

PS: there might be a surge of energy to my head while being",0
"Pretty much said it all in the above haha. 
Just want to know if anyone else has felt this or any advice would be awesome. 
I ventured into this because I want to be kinder, calmer, more focused and not just struggle to get through my work day but actively love it and live in the moment. 
I use this app to teach me how to meditate and was meditating before work and after work to calm myself down and put my head in a nice headspace before I would go to work. I honestly felt like I saw the changes. I wasn’t engaging in any negative talk about work, I was stopping my need for energy drinks in the morning, I wasn’t so nervous going to work and worrying things wouldn’t work out... I’m sure you get the point. I just thought, wow this is so awesome. I’ve found a loophole in this life! I can do this! 
And then yes, as said above. It’s like I just rejected the morning from the get go. When my alarm went off, I was shaking it in anger. Then I angrily went downstairs, got in the shower and just cried. My boyfriend asked me what was wrong and I said I didn’t even know. He convinced me to have the day off work. Which was very sweet and kind of him. But now not being at work has made me feel even more of a failure. Maybe I held a too higher expectation? 
It may also be that I’ve been having later nights than usual and I have to get up pretty early for work. But it just felt so odd to be tired, mediate and then feel excellent at work these past days and then today... nope. This might just be a whole load of crap I’m writing I just want to understand why.. anyway if you’ve read all this. I just thank you for taking the time.",0
"I was never really a big drinker. However, I did enjoy drinking casually with friends in a social setting. I enjoyed the reduced inhibition it gave me. However, after I started meditating earnestly, I began to pay attention to how alcohol really effects my body. I began to observe how alcohol changes my focus and attention as well as how it feels within my body. After observing these changes, I realized that I no longer enjoy it. I didn't like the feeling it gave me, and the only enjoyment I got out of it was an immediate, short-lived dopamine rush. After that, the negative effects took over. The sluggishness and inattentiveness really became a hindrance to my sense of being present.

Just thought I'd share these insights.",0
"Hello community, I've been meditating for a week now. Whilst meditating I keep repeating breathing in, breathing out in my head.
I've noticed after about 10 min into the meditation I sometimes mumble and say something far off my usual ""breathing in, breathing out"".

Is this usual, a sign of something or what.
I also sometimes feel pulsating and I warm up even though it's chilly.

Am I on the right track?",0
Want this post to be all motivation for those days that its needed and can always come back to!,0
Hi! I’m celebrating my birthday soon and I want to do something for my friends. I was thinking on spending the day outside introducing them to meditation and doing activities to bring us together and make them feel present and disconnected from their daily distractions. Can you help me plan a possible agenda or listing some activities we could do? I’d be really grateful :),0
"Any tips on meditating while you're sick with a cold or allergies? My nose isn't particularly stuffy, so I don't have much trouble with my breath, but inhaling deeply and having a rush of cool air against the back of my throat sends me into a coughing fit. Not exactly calming. I can't even imagine how one could meditate if they were suffering from a stuffed up nose. Other than foregoing meditation until feeling better, what are some ways to get around being sick and still meditate?",0
I’ve been doing really well in my meditation practice these past few weeks. I’ve experienced waves of euphoria several times and other blessings during meditation. Right now I’m experiencing something outside my meditation on a daily basis. Sometimes I’ll be at work doin my thang and all of a sudden I feel absolutely still. I don’t really know how to explain it other than that but it seems as if I am noticing everything in my surroundings moving and even I’m moving sometimes but I feel so still. As if my movements are calmer. Can someone shed some light on this?,0
"Safety first, of course :) 

My initial motivation to start experimenting with driving and meditation/mindfulness (M/M) was to become a better driver. I naturally find driving very boring. Much more boring than all my inner thoughts and concerns and whatever else would bubble around inside me. So to help myself become a more attentive driver I thought of utilizing some of the practices I learned from meditation. 

Specifically:

- *Breathing*: Find where my breath was going and trying to take fuller and calmer breaths. I find this helps on long drives on a highway to sustain attention on the road and environment.

- *Body Scan*: Again safety first - so I found that either before I start driving I can do a body scan to get into a comfortable but attentive driving posture. While driving, I only felt that long stretches on the highway allowed for a sort of parcelled out body scan to defuse tension across my body and develop a better posture.

- *Visual Attention*: I naturally have a sort of tunnel vision in my visual attention which isn’t ideal for surveying traffic situations. I’ve found that softening my gaze and allowing in more information from my peripheral vision allows me to a be a much more attentive driver. I sometimes practice this on the highway but it’s not super useful there. The skill really shines when driving through crowded urban areas cause it allows for noticing and tracking many more people and vehicles all around you at once.

- *Processing*: I’m not sure what the official name is for this in meditation as I am mostly a novice, but I’ve found that when I use all the above plus a sort of calm-abiding mind while driving (again only works on long, boring highway stretches) then I can sort of softly observe both the outer world (and respond accordingly when necessary) and my inner world (a sort of meditative practice). It’s not nearly as good as just meditating and doing nothing else but maybe it can be? I don’t know.

So that’s what I’ve figured out so far. What are your thoughts and experiences? Ever tried this? How far could you take it? Did you feel it helped you become a better driver? Could you access a meditative state while driving safely? :)",0
"I am sorry to bother you guys due to my ignorance, but I can't find answers to what I'm experiencing anywhere. I was meditating about 8 minutes ago afor at least 10 minutes. About 5 minutes in I started feeling my energy rise and somewhat violent vibrations. There was no pain, but I had the feeling that if I continue I was going to give up the ghost and leave my body. I wasn't scared, but it's safe to say that I wasn't ready for it. I opened my eyes hoping that it would subside, but it didn't stop until I started physically moving. The sensation was about the same as feeling 3 billion bolts of electricity running through my body, but without the pain. I started to just let it rock, but its almost impossible to be perfectly fine with being struck by 15 lightening bolts and feeling you spirit lift up from your body and transcending consciousness lol. This is the 2nd time I've had this happen, ever. Does ANYBODY have advice or know what went on? Should I have kept going? Am I going crazy? Perhaps. I'm going to take a shower and go back in to attempt to figure out ""where"" I was going. Help is appreciated and much love 💕

"I came to the realization today that maybe my ego has prevented me from being happy all along. I don't know, but it sure is scary to think about.  I like to think that I have it in check but it's checked me. I went to one BJJ class and didn't go back even though I wanted to. That's just one example of many of me folding when things get challenging. I can't face the fact that I may be less awesome than I make my self out to be. It's just as scary to think that I might be stronger because if that's true then it's ALL on me. Sorry if this doesn't make sense, as I am sleep deprived.",0
"I've been meditating for 15-20 minutes every morning for the past 3 weeks.  First thing in the morning after I brush my teeth and wash my face I go and meditate.  I've been doing mantra meditations mostly.  I am confident, Everything will be alright, I can do this, etc. With a little bit of just focusing on my breath mixed in.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've started I feel more in control and aware of my emotions.  I can recognize what is causing me to feel sad or happy easier and almost immediatly.  However, every emotion is more intense.  I've never felt anxiety before, but for the past week I have been a ball of nerves and I know exactly why.  I have a crush on someone and Im pretty sure she likes me back, but it would be a pretty bad idea to date atm, but thats beside the point. The point of the post is that I don't like this anxiety.  I don't know if I like feeling everything more fully even the good stuff.  I just did really well on a project and brought extra value to my team and feel super proud about it.  Idk if I have felt prouder about something before.  And even that good feeling, feels almost too intense.  Life was easier when it was duller.

Has anyone else experienced something like this?  How did you overcome or accept it?

"The great cosmic joke is that you are what you are seeking. 

All the religious and spiritual seeking on this planet and you end up back where you started. We all look for happiness, peace and fulfillment in the things of the world, yet all along these things are our very nature – our very own center of being. 

Every single thing you imagine yourself to be is a clever lie constructed by a psychological defense mechanism against the existential truth of transiency.  In other words you are not who you think you are.

""I laugh when I think how I once sought paradise as a realm outside of the world of birth. It is right in the world of birth and death that the miraculous truth is revealed. But this is not the laughter of someone who suddenly acquires a great fortune; neither is it the laughter of one who has won a victory. It is, rather, the laughter of one who; after having painfully searched for something for a long time, finds it one morning in the pocket of his coat.""

"Is it possible, through patient and experienced meditative practices, to explore one's own unconscious?

Forgive me if this question sounds stupid, ignorant, or uniformed ... but I'm really a neophyte in this area and striving hard to learn. I understand and appreciate meditation can evidently bring about a great deal of emotional benefits in the form of relaxation, stress reduction, so on and so forth. What I'm mostly interested in is finding some way of “discovering myself” – I want to meet the *real me*, deep down past all the layers of ego and psyche I've wrapped about my core to mask and hide who I really am. Does any of this make sense? I feel almost as though I need a vision quest of some sort, to find my true self and subsequently set myself upon a path toward positive growth and spiritual enlightenment. 

And it recently occurred to me that perhaps I ought to inquire about meditation. I realize I might perhaps require training and a great amount of experience and effort before achieving any sort of “breakthroughs” ... but is this sort of thing possible, and if so, what manner of meditative traditions or techniques would it be most wise for a person in my situation to pursue to better dive past the self-critical conscience mind and into the depths of the basic, subconscious core of my own identity?

Many thanks in advance for your patience and helpful guidance.",0

I got pretty upset and was crying a lot tonight and wanted to meditate before bed to calm myself. I found it really difficult as I couldn’t help but get caught back up in those emotions. I started crying again and the meditation kind of broke off at that point. How do others handle strong emotions when meditating? I’d really like this to be a technique I can employ in those tough moments.,0
"Everybody always says “you need to change your mindset”. Which I agree is super valuable, but how?? Like what specifically did you do to worry less and be more confident?",0
"For example, how would you handle a situation where someone states an opinion or feeling of their own which differs from your own. I find that sometimes I have an emotion towards this and I struggle with understanding that feeling the intense emotion isn't bad and that just because I may feel a negative emotion doesn't mean the person's stance is inherently bad or harmful. Take the case of my significant other and I, she said she feels like she might not want kids and that she's been thinking about whereas I do later on in life, this caused an emotional reaction in me because I'm worried if we do reach that point, it's something to worry about even if her stance or thoughts about it change. 

I accept that this is her feelings about it, and I can't change it, I have been breathing more and letting myself feel the emotions and be very aware of it and why I feel that way, how do I make sure I am not unfair to her feelings or not understanding. Maybe I'm just worried about this too much? 

What's a healthy way to deal with these things? I try to be aware but at some point I have a thought where it's saying I'm disconnected from my emotions and her just because I am trying to be aware and realize I'm not my emotions. Is it normal to feel a little disconnected when you are able to separate yourself from the emotions you feel? Is this bad? I have so many questions",0

I made it about 4 or 5 days but was surprised that even when I woke up feeling ok, and the 5 minutes went well, I would still find myself crying after.  After those few days the idea of trying to meditate felt like too much of an emotional weight to take on.

As you all on this subreddit probably know, there are many different light and healing love meditations and ceremonies out there. Some of these meditations will help manifest the most positive ascension timelines for humanity. The above link is one very effective mass meditation that, if you take part in, will surely help move our planet closer to a timeline of world peace. Please give it a chance and try it out. You can do the meditations on this site, even if it is not the exact time of  the meditation schedule. There are also many other different mass meditations on the home page of the website I linked.

The following two links are a few free pages about how to do the merkaba meditation (recreating your human lightbody)-

And this is the updated version straight from the book:


https://imgur.com/gallery/0TJgwTB


This meditation, if done while feeling love energy, will release negativity and blockages from your chakras and open them up, thus restoring proper energy flow in your body, and improving your health. It can also change your consciousness to a higher dimensional awareness of peace, love and harmony with all life everywhere.


I highly suggest giving this meditation a try. Here is a guided audio link on YT of the merkaba meditation:




https://youtu.be/81Kf3UBQ1g8




Its from the book ""the ancient secrets of the flower of life part 2"".  The book also teaches spiritual anatomy of your 13 chakras,  healing, psychic powers, how to cast out entities/demons from your energy field, how to reconnect to mother earth,  the cosmos and your higher self,  and talks about a few intergalactic conspiracies and the current great awakening!


Here's a few pages from the book about the Lucifer experiment and how we can stop judgment and transcend this duality:

Here is another very useful meditation called the unity breath. It goes hand in hand with merkaba meditation. It will allow you to tap into a stream of infinite healing love energy:

"I've been practicing mindfulness meditation for 4 years. Over the last month or two I've developed two of the following physical sensations:

* A constant feeling of pressure in my head as if it were a balloon overfilled with water
* Occasionally, my head and upper back want to fold forward 90 degrees spontaneously. They hang as if I were a rag doll. It feels good to be in this position but it looks bizarre from the side.

I have hypotheticals of there being like body memory or trauma within me that wants to be expressed but I have no idea really...

Has anybody experienced things like this? Any ideas on what might be happening?",0
"* Meditate same time everyday, this will help you slip into deep meditation quicker. 
* Try to eat light before you meditate
* drink alot of water before your session.
* Keep your back straight, if you feel it slouching straighten it. 

If your shooting to extend your mediation sessions to 30mins to 1 hour, to 1 hour to 2 hours, etc - Pace yourself. Each day hold your meditation longer and longer.  


After weeks of consistent meditation(keep in mind, you have to do this at the same time)  you should be able to get into a deep meditation(samadhi) within 30-40 minutes. You will fall in and out of samadhi deepening on how long you are going for.   


Hope this helps someone",0
"I've tried many times, and I just could not ever end a session feeling like I did what I was supposed to. I felt like I never actually ""meditated"" before. It was only today that I finally understood what meditation is about. Usually when meditating, one of the basic concepts is to ""focus on the breath"". **focus** being the key word here. So Everytime I meditated, I tried my hardest to ""focus on the breath"", and come back to it if my mind wandered off. I found out this was my problem. 

I use the Headspace app, and almost every meditation session, Andy (The narrator), starts off with focusing on the breath. After a little while, he tells you to ""let your mind wander"" for just a couple seconds. Well something I noticed several times (That I guess never clicked in my head), was that I realized that the more I focused on my breath, the harder it was to do. It was like by focusing on the breath, I was RESISTING thoughts. Whenever he would say ""let your mind wander"", that's when I felt most calm and like I didn't have to give any effort. When I focused on the breath, thoughts kept flying in everywhere, and it was near impossible to focus on the breath. When it was ""let your mind wander time"", I realized those thoughts that kept trying to come in, weren't anymore (At least no where near to the same degree as when I focused on my breath). And therefore there was no more resistance. 

Just today is when this realization clicked in, during my Headspace session. After it was over, I realized that I need to just let my mind wander the ENTIRE TIME. I'm not going to ""focus"" on ANYTHING. And I realized by doing this, I felt a sense of freedom, and zero resistance, and I wasn't ""attaching"" to my thoughts that were coming in anymore. All this time and I never got it. Now I do. Excited to have more sessions and see the benefits now!",0
"When somebody reads enough about meditation and other peoples subjective experiences, one is bound to stumble upon many people describing lights, absolute bliss, one-ness, spiritual hallucinations and other things, that everybody is told not to chase.

But I desire such an experience. I am not sure if I'd believe in whatever I experience, but it would be a lie, if I didn't want to **feel** one-ness, all encompassing blissfull light, spiritual or religious stuff and so on. At least once.

After reading like 20 of such experiences, I ""see"" them everywhere. Whenever I have a good meditation session (just watching the breath and going back to it over and over again) where my chattering minds shuts up for a while and I 'kinda' see white points, my mind goes into a hyperactive ""Oh boi, here it comes, here it comes, don't get distracted, watch the breath, ah, it's over, just back to the breath.... Ah! It comes back! Nvm... just back to the breath....""-mode.

Which means I'd likely never experience something like that. Can't really change that, but the bigger problem is that my mind starts something like this whenever I am having a good session... it feels like a hindrance that degrades a good time... But I can't let the expectation/hope for such an experience go.... after all, it would be incredible interesting to experience something like that...

New meditator here. I usually don’t have a time set and just play it by ear. Today I wanted to get 15 mins in for sure so I set a timer a started. Completely forgot about the timer and was in a dreamy state until it scared the shit out of me. Gave myself a good laugh,0

"As a westerner deeply interested in buddhism/Eastern philosophy for some reason it's never occurred to me until just recently,  that my meditation practice didn't have to be performed cross legged in a traditional Buddhist zendo.(if for some lucky reason this interesting type of place is available in your town I still do envy you, but in my desperate attempts to develope a steady meditation practice I've stumbled. I've always enjoyed the silence of libraries and the soft sounds of typing and hushed chatter. In an act of sheer luck I happened to think to sit down and decided to meditate in the library and this kind of environment has done wonders for my practice i am able to sit for hours at a time now, I know meditation can and should be done anywhere but having a place to go specifically for my seated meditation is akin to going to a gym to work out it gives you a sense of purpose for being in that place to preform your act undisturbed I've also discovered going to different libraries in different towns is also fun. Every town has one of these dojos if you have struggled to develope a steady seated practice I urge you to grab a seat in your local library and try it out. They are wonderful for finding peace and they've been right under my nose all this time, if you have a special meditation place of your own that youd like to share please do",0

"One day when I was trying to meditate, but the thoughts were on overdrive and I couldn't settle down. So as I was trying to passively watch my thoughts, I opened the flood gates and just let all thoughts happen at once. When I did that, it's like the superposition of thoughts caused a normalization and my thoughts disappeared and what was left was the state of no-mind.

"i’ve been practicing mindfulness meditation for about 3 months and have been practicing consistently every day for about 3 weeks now. i’ve noticed that i’m able to get deeper into very relaxed states quicker as i practice more. today i reached a state in which my body was totally and completely relaxed. in this moment i truly felt like i was observing my thoughts from a third person point of view. my brain was jumping from one thought to the next with no breaks in between. it was like listening to my inner voice just chatter away to itself. at some point i felt my mind cease to think- and my body literally felt like it was floating. for just a couple of seconds i felt pure bliss. then i heard the sound of my dog’s collar jingle as she entered the room and a thought entered my mind again. i tried to picture the thought as a cloud in the sky and let it leave my mind but then immediately after that another thought followed it. and another. and i noticed the pattern. i had the epiphany that - holy shit, my mind is actually thinking like this for hours upon hours every single day- this is its normal state. it’s insane. our minds are constantly making up things and repeating them. i tried to get myself back into that state where my mind was free of thought but every time i tried different thoughts would pop up. it was like my inner voice wouldn’t be quiet! lol. this was also the first time that i experienced myself wanting to stay in meditation longer than usual. normally i set my timer but today i did not and instead of coming out of my meditation i decided to stay for several more minutes in this relaxed state. ironically whenever i awoke from my meditative state the song playing on my phone was titled “feelings come and go like clouds.” i’m curious who else has experienced something similar to this. i’m really excited about what i experienced and i’m eager to keep practicing. hopefully i can get myself back to this “thoughtless” state and enjoy more of it. it was truly wonderful. namaste :)",0

"I've recently started reading Dune from Frank Herbert, and the lessons from the book so far draw so many parallels to my lessons in meditating. As of yesterday's session, I've been going through my breathing patterns and noting emotions and thoughts. I also see that focusing on breathing, rather than on restlessness and sleepiness, help my mind. But, the strongest comparison comes from the quote, ""Fear is the mind-killer."" From this one quote and trying to get closer to clarity of mind, I can finally see myself smiling in the mirror and noticing the little things in life. There is additional quotes from that line that talk about facing fears, and overcoming it, which I thought to be Camus-esque. But, it also is a lesson from my meditating. Whenever I find my mind working 500 thoughts a minutes, I take time to think of my thoughts as cars passing by. There is no tension. And, the place I am hoping to get is to see a blue sky in my mind, which I feel I am getting closer to.

"Hello peeps!

I'm a curious person who likes to learn about different techniques and different philosophies so I decided to sign up for a TM talk/presentation.

This is my experience of the TM presentation at their office in my City. 

A lady sitting behind a laptop, under a projector screen presentened TM to myself and 2 other people. 
They show you a tonne of slides of the health benefits of it. Scientific evidence -  including EEG scans and lots of other brian wave stuff. Lots of graphs showing the benefits which I found to be extremely vague. I pointed out that they didnt say anything about what the sample size was, what questions were asked. They didnt mention how long the participants had practiced or any details. The slides just showed an increase in this or a decrease in that.

After all their slides about different parts of the brain I asked if they had any studies about TM and the default mode network. They said that this area is very active and lights up during TM.


There was also a slide section comparing different meditation practices -  it really felt like they were slagging on all the other types. 
They suggested that mindfulness meditation acted on certain parts of the brain (the ones they mentioned earlier that were associated with sleepiness I believe) and they differentiated Vipassana meditation as the ""direct focus"" kind and that it worked on a different part as well. They mentioned compassion meditation as well but none of these other types changed the brain as much as TM does. TM was different b/c it gave your brain something to do and also gave you the ""transendental exp"". 


After just over an hour long talk they slap you with the price tag. 
$1310 CAD which includes 2 1on1 lessons. They also mentioned you can come back anytime to ""tune up"" your TM. 

I know I sound cynical...well that's because thats how I feel. I know very little about meditation so it's very possible I missed something or am confused. 

Hope all who read this are having a rad day!",0

"Hey Everyone, I'm new to reddit but I figured I would give this a shot. 

Context: I moved for work about a year ago and ever since then I have been over analyzing everything and comparing myself to others. On top of that I started seeing this girl a while back, we ramped things up really quickly and I fell for her really hard even though I knew she was moving before we started seeing each other. I know realized it would not have worked out in the long run. Ever since then she has been on my mind.

Everything else in the grand scheme of things is going really well. I have hobbies, been doing new things, been going on trips, meeting up with friends, etc. When I'm keeping myself busy I'm ok, but once I'm on my own I start to ruminate and overthink. I have been meditating 8-10 minutes in the morning and in the evening, and 5 minutes when I get back from work. I meditate by sitting on the floor by the window (so I can hear the bugs and birds chirping) and focus on my breath.

so...

Do you guys think that anyone can guide meditation and organize a meditation group? 

Should the guide be experienced in meditative practices or can they be relatively new? 

Should they have a rigorous personal practice or can they not meditate at all? 

Will a meditation group be productive if it lacks a diverse array of people along different places in the spiritual path? Common thought has me believe that meditation groups need a teacher who has been far down the spiritual path...

But lately I’ve not been sleeping 8h/night and I feel like I can’t focus properly because my mind starts wandering like if I was dreaming. Is it because of lack of sleep?

"I just completed my first 20 hours of total meditation time with a 20 minute session and it was such an incredible experience I wanted to share. 

I started meditating before sunrise so the time would end just as the sun was hitting my window.

Like a new layer of my mind opened that I could just melt into. 

I then transitioned into wishing love, health, and peace for my son and partner and the tingling got stronger and stronger.

"I’ve been meditating for about 18days now (25 sessions- 249 minutes).  My typical practice is roughly 10-15 minutes daily in the morning. I have meditated later in the evening on some nights, and the most I have meditated in one day has been 46 minutes. I sit on a zafu in a zazen position. I’m currently using the sattva app to guide my meditations. I want to experience finding my third eye. I guess my question is how should I focus my gaze to open this shakra. I feel that if I’m looking towards the spot on my forehead that I’m almost feeling like my eyes are going cross eyed.  Am I trying to hard? Should this not be my focus? I do focus on the breath, and often times have pressures between my eyes during/after meditation.  It’s something that I’m honestly “eager” to experience.  Does anyone have any tips, or feedback for me.

"I understand that a variation of this question has been asked many times, however I am hoping to be more nuanced in what I am experiencing when I ask this question: Is it possible to get worse at meditation as you go on?

Some background: I started meditating about 3-4 years ago nearly every day. I started out with zazen and have tried other styles including TMI, Shambhala, and some self-inquiry stuff. However while I remember experiencing very brief cessation of thoughts and emotions (and it was a crazy positive experience), I distinctly remember feeling the waves of my emotions and being able to categorize them as they came and went. I could clearly feel different emotions and reactions my body experienced. Compared to now where I feel that I am struggling to even identify any feeling I am having and when asked a question such as ""bring your awareness to your heart and listen to what it's feeling"" I cannot feel anything. Prior to this (maybe two years ago) I was able to do this quite easily and could immediately sense my experience. 

I am extremely frustrated with my practice, but not to the point where I feel terrible about this. After all, at this point this practice is simply a part of my life at this point. Positive or negative feelings aside, I feel that overall it has benefited me. The concern for me is whether this is simply a ""stage"" in the journey or if I am actually doing something wrong and training my brain in an incorrect way. I appreciate any insight people can give me. Thank you all so much.",0

"In 2 months, I have an entrance exam which I decided to give my all in. The exam is for 3 hours with no breaks in between. It consists of 100 questions. Basically, there's no time to breathe. My case here is, I am able to do well for the first hour of the exam before my stamina and focus start to fade away and I can see that in the results. The exam is broken up into 3 sections. I get 99 percentile in the first section and then start decreasing to 90 and 80 in the later sections. It's not that I can't answer the questions. When I analyze the test I've written, there were questions I was able to answer that I left, or I made a silly mistake in the ones that I answered. I've been through a multiple of these tests now, and this has always been the case. Through constant feedback, I think I now know what's the real problem here. It's not the skill but the focus to persist. 

Also, 2 more things to add: 

1. During the exams, through section 1-3, I know my focus is not 100%. I've been thinking about other things that randomly pop up in my mind which I think I'm unable to control. My ex cheating on me a year ago still haunts to this date, adding to the mental strain and distraction. 

2. I know there are apps for meditation that can be helpful, I've tried. It works for a day or two, and then I forget about it and I get back to the same old self. 

I need a 99.xx percentile overall to clear the exam. With 2 months left, a bit of advice on helping me focus would be of real help and it's much appreciated.",0

"Two years ago I had a very bad emotional breakdown.  I had acquired PTSD from a relationship with a woman who dumped me.  I needed therapy, I'm still in therapy - but the most wonderful gift my therapist gave me was the suggestion to meditate.  He didn't tell me how to do it, he just suggested I learn on my own - as it will be part of the healing process.  So I did.  I looked into Buddhism, Hindu traditions and breathing techniques, mindfulness.  It was a struggle at first.  My ego was still eating away at me:  ""Why me? Why doesn't she love you anymore?  I love her so much, I need her! What am I going to do?"" Two years later, I look back at it all very differently.  Sometimes we just need a catalyst in our lives to spark something beautiful, to push us in a new direction.  Meditation helps with so many issues.  When we clear our minds of thoughts, clarity ensues.  The real truth comes out.  I never understood the term ""love yourself"" - and now I completely understand it.  Love and light to you all.  Meditation works, never give up.",0

"for a long time i felt like i wasn’t “progressing” very much in my practice. i felt like whenever i would sit down to meditate i would find myself intellectualising about everything i experienced. i became frustrated that i couldn’t stop doing that. but today it was as if i just accepted that that was a part of me—that i will find myself intellectualising about my experiences. which lead me to a second insight.

i often use the Waking Up meditation app, outside of my normal practice. and Sam Harris often says “pay attention to the breath from the moment it starts to the moment it is ends.” or “pay attention to the moment a thought arises” that sort of thing. and i was again sort of frustrated for the longest time that it seemed my conscious awareness of something only occurred a few moments after it had started. i would find myself thinking about something without even knowing how the thought began. i think i realised more that i’m just watching things happen. there’s only an illusion of control that somehow occurs, but when i pay attention i can’t find any. even so far as the accepting of these parts of myself seem out of my control. i couldn’t force myself to accept them, but through lots of practice it just spontaneously came about one day.

"I learned in my one class that nirvana is essentially “feeling/watching” both positive and negative emotions go by without attachment and that it is pure bliss. To me tho, that kind of seems scary, doesn’t it? Learning this made me question meditation a little bit. Is the goal of meditation to be able to deattatch from negative thoughts to be able to focus on positive thoughts? Cuz to me, that would be nirvana. When you deattatch from positive AND negative thoughts, that seems borderline depressing and that seems like one would just be emotionless in a bad way. I also don’t understand how you can go without attachment from both without repressing emotions. Say if you have reached a very high meditative state in your life and someone close to you dies. How would one who has achieved such a state react in that situation??? Because the way I see one reacting to that is emotionless and that seems terrifying.

I am curious though. I have a long history with a dysfunctional family. I have had to cut off close family and friends (even cut off my brother) because I feel like they don't respect boundaries. I would say a significant chunk of my negative life events have come as a result of being a ""nice guy"". As a result I almost feel sort of guilty for being cheery or upbeat. Sometimes I catch myself with a slight smile throughout the day.

I am almost scared that if I am seen in this light or I see myself in this light I won't be able to standup for myself.

**does meditating make you passive? less able to standup for yourself?**

My intuition is that the answer is no. Unless you hold ridiculous new agey spiritual beliefs that holding anger against someone is wrong. Which I don't at all. I think meditation could make one submissive if the individual uses it as a form of escapism or the individual firmly believes that harming others under any circumstance is wrong (which is just silly)",0

I also noticed I now can sense when I am tense, and make an active effort to relax and release tension. In retrospect I couldn't even tell the difference between being tense and relaxed. And I've been tense a lot... for a long time.

Meditation really seems to help with self-awareness and psychological self-control, and that's great.",0
"Hey all, long term lurker / Headspace user. Approaching a 200 day streak in the app.

I unfortunately shattered my ankle skateboarding the other day. There was obviously some pain in the beginning, but you know what my reaction to the accident was without even thinking about it? Once friends had called 911, I immediately started meditating, focusing on my breath and “noticing” everything going on around me. I of course took the painkillers provided once the ambulance arrived, but meditating for that five or ten minutes while waiting allowed me to stay pretty calm and not focus my energy on fhe pain. My friends were impressed.

Just wanted to share to pass on the benefits of this wonderful activity. Even if you just get a meditation app and start by doing it a minute a day, it is so so worth it. I hope this has helped someone.",0
"So one of my email subscriptions gave me this idea:

'One way to work on yourself is by being present in the body. Another way is by expanding the heart. A third way is by quieting the mind. The wise person finds a way to work on all three at the same time.'

"Yo, I recently got back from my first 10 day vipassana retreat. I had done 3 Zen retreats before, but omg this was so much better!

I can’t believe nobody ever told me how different Vipassana meditation is than other meditation techniques! I was mind blown when they taught it to us on the fourth day. It’s not so easy to describe, and you probably can’t learn it without doing the 10 day course, because they teach techniques step by step that build on each other. 

**So what is this great unique technique?** Awareness of sensations in the body. It’s not just “body scanning”. You put your awareness on a body part and stay there till you feel sensations. They feel like buzzing vibrations, almost like little pieces of sand flowing around. A myriad of other body sensations can arise as well, but mostly you isolate your awareness on each part of the body feeling these sensations, and then you sweep them throughout your body. 

The point isn’t to feel sensations, it’s to remain equanimous despite whatever pleasant or unpleasant sensations you feel. Supposedly these sensations have something to do with the unconscious mind, and thus you’re reprogramming yourself to not react in craving or aversion.

Their retreats are free! They aren’t a religion (although, it’s definitely the teachings of the Buddha).   No bland meals like in my old Zen retreats, you get a tasty vegetarian buffet. Go find a Vipassana center near you and learn this amazing unique meditation technique!!!!!!",0
"Hey guys this is my first time posting but something weird happened last time I meditated. So after a while about 15 minutes after I had cleared everything from my head and I was completely relaxed I got a vid image of a field of tall dead grass. It was like I was there. There was a black woman in a long flowing white dress, her eyes were white, and all of her was just floating effortlessly. She came up to me and asked,
“Do you worship me?” I told her yes and then she ate me... it wasn’t painful of like how you normally eat food it was like she was pushing me inside of her and merging my everything with hers. I don’t know what this means or who this lady could have been. If anyone knows anything that could help me it would be much appreciated.",0
"So i have been meditating for over 4 months straight, i was really in a bad mental state before until i discovered to meditate, which literally saved me from having to kill myself but I won't get into all that and everyone must have experienced something difficult in their life and got out of it. I am gratefully happy that i found a way out and I'm doing really good with my life, meditating changed everything for me very drastically and gave me sense of hope that i will hold on to permanently, but one thing i started to feel as I kept meditating everyday of the last few weeks i have been sleeping a lot, i set alarms to alert me to get up on time but i don't even hear it most of the time and it goes on snooze (I leave my phone on my bed stand thats like 5 inches up my head) and i don't even hear it sometimes, when i do i become half awake but find it really hard to get up or go back asleep again and I sleep for 10 to 12 hours.",0

"I'm relatively new to practicing my mind and I noticed something interesting while narrating myself- like interior dialogue. I noticed that while I was questioning and answering within myself, I heard a second self blurt an answer simultaneous to my own self. This was both surprising and not surprising. 

I've been wittingly practicing my mind for quite a while, but I've only recently been able to recognize/appreciate minds' eyesight and I think I overdid it. I was caught in what felt like ""rumination"", but it wasn't any single looping thought, it was just that I couldn't close my eyes with seeing ""everything"".

I've recognized this ""second self"" far in the past, but never had I recognized it within my mind, as it had only expressed itself external (like me just saying something to myself, out loud, that I did not wittingly say.). I was surprised because it was the first time I heard a voice in my head that I can say without doubt, that ""I"" had no influence over what the second self said. When it spoke, it ""felt"" strikingly different, yet a part of, what it felt to be where ""I"" am- meaning, what I attribute to the ""thinker"". 

Later that night, my head was swirling with imagery and I began to feel like I had simply allowed negative entities passage. I felt like I experienced the tip of what could be madness. My head was pulsing until I was able to relax it. I didn't sleep until dawn and only for a few hours. It was a good lesson learned.",0

"So I just did my TM session and while things didn't look promising at all for as long as I was conscious, at some point I just lost consciousness. At one point this state of trance got broken because a friend was calling. The session didn't appear to be long but actually lasted a good hour.

Has anyone else experienced this before? It was completely different to when you get all types of sensations. There was just nothing with no observer either.",0
"i was following along with a guided meditation last night before bed, and it was going well up til the point that the recording said to ""finally relax all the way to zero"". well at first my mind was blank and i felt calm, but soon after i was bombarded with a bunch of anxious thoughts, and i felt very nervous. it's like i suddenly became aware of everything going wrong around me. i kept trying to bring my attention back to my breathing, but to no avail. this usually doesn't happen to me, and it was very distressing.

so is this a sign that there's underlying anxiety i need to work through? like built-up stress? or is it not a big deal and i should just try again tonight?",0
"Let me start by saying that I do not by any means have any infinite answer nor have I found the depth of what mediation can be. After reading many stories on this thread, I believe that at this point I desire to express the impact it has had and what it has brought me in just under one years time, in effort to help others. 

First, I meditate two times a day, morning and night, 20 minutes each time. I meditate with some time of ambient noise (fan on low setting) along with a very downtempo mix from soundcloud (check out slumber sessions). I sit, I have a two syllable mantra, and breathing is and has always been my main focus. 

Much like many others in this group, I could go on and on about the impact that it has made, but in effort to keep this short(er) and concise, I would say that meditation is what I would compare to a LONG IV drip for the mind. You may never feel it right away but the impact comes over time. 

There will be bad days.

There will be days where you sit and have so much thought that your mantra is drown out, breathing seems impossible,  and that any time sitting feels like an eternity. 

There will be days where you just don't have any desire to sit. 

There will be hours spent feeling like this may, in fact be a waste of time.  

Keep going. 

Continue on through the days where you don't want to participate and even if you don't feel it, stick it out. 

Because there will be that one day. That one time you open your eyes and the world feels a little bit different. 

That day where you will be swept with so much emotion that sobbing mid-mediation is the only option. 

That day where you're sitting in a situation and you feel the ability to be present, to not control the flow, but to exist in the moments between. To recognize awareness, knowing that the next thought is temporary and will not take away from this moment. 

The point is don't suppress what comes; instead let it come and simply let it go. 

When you take away the desire for the result, you begin to open up the awareness that allows you to become one with it. 

You will never find ""it"" but you will know when it has found you. 

In conclusion, try to minimize expectation. Commit to it if you feel like it has a place and serves a purpose.  And nurture each moment you can recognize. Whether a feeling of good, or bad. Address it. Let it have its moment and when you do, you will find room for so much to enter when you stop letting past of future events cloud up the present. 

Personally, I know that I'm only getting started and I know that I am going forward in the direction I am, because of meditation. I also know that IF I CAN DO IT, ANYONE CAN. 

It isn't easy, and it takes a bit of determination. But keep it simple, if it finds a place in your life, embrace it, explore. Above all, be yourself and live at your own pace.",0

"When I meditate, especially after not being so consistent with it, the first sensations I get are anxiety and stress.

"Why do you live so hard? For what, for whom?

You have give up on your dream life and are busy living in a compromise with reality.
In your own reality, you see your dream as a vain delusion.
You think that everyone lives like that.
You think that you live the right answer.
However, you always feel restless and cramped in the depths of your inner world.
Your mind says something is wrong.

What were the teachings that the spiritual teachers in all times and places wanted to convey to us?
Although today we are now able to recognize their teachings easily and accustomed, we are immersed in the profound and form of the words of the old way of teaching, passing by without knowing what we need to know.

In the movie ""The Matrix"", the main character Neo is offered the choice between a red pill and a blue pill by Morpheus.
The blue pill will allow him to go back to his life without transformation, be satisfied with the existing reality and believing in what he has believed so far.
On the other hand, the red pill will allow him to he has a chance to realize the truth of the essence, become a true master of his world and become truly free.

Like Neo, you are standing at the crossroads of your life at this moment.
Maybe you have a vague fear or disdain about choosing to realize the truth of the essence.
But if you want to escape from the existing reality, if you want to fill your life with true satisfaction and happiness, you can choose to realize the truth of the essence.

When you realize the essence, you understand that the truth you've been looking for is yourself.
And you understand that you have the power to be free from all the pain, that all the possibilities are on your side.
And now, in this moment, you have a complete experience of being truly free.

The choice of this moment now is the most important first choice given to you.
The choice of this moment now makes a huge difference in your life.
If you postpone the choice to the next time, the choice disappears without returning.
Maybe this is the last chance given to you, hope that miracle with the chance not to scatter will follow you.",0
"I'm often terrible at sticking with things, so I'm pleased to say that I'm nearly two weeks into daily morning meditation and it's going great.

Although I have meditated about 60ish times (according to my mindfulness app) over the last year, I'd still consider myself a novice. I've been using the Calm app, which has great weekly and 21 day programmes. 

Meditation is a great way to combat waking up in the morning with the usual haze of stress and anxiety; I feel at peace afterwards (albeit for a short time) and the techniques I've learned have helped me approach typical daily problems a different way.

Anyway, that's my story. Wish you the best with your own journey.",0

" Hey [/r/meditation](https://www.reddit.com/r/meditation)!

We all know that meditation is not an antidote or a quick fix to be used in the moment of bad experience. It's a regular practice that slowly helps us handle these moments when they arise.

However, I wanted to kick off the discussion by asking;

In a moment of intense emotion (e.g. overwhelm, anxiety, anger), do you have a standard procedure of getting through it. As in, ""When I get anxious, I first do this, then this, then this....""

I personally have a method I go through and would love to put it into a post/graphic (and possibly even an interactive feature in Guide) but would love to read what you all do. I'll edit this comment with my method once the discussion gets going.

Thanks and I look forward to the great discussion!

"I just wanted to share! I’m absolutely flabbergasted. I did not think something like this was possible. My lower back has been screaming for the past few days due to an irritated psoas(I think). It has really been bothering me and getting in the way of me being able to focus on work. I just did a ten minute guided meditation. And afterward I noticed a massive decrease in lower back pain. 

I want to make it clear that I was not meditating to help with the pain. The pain had nothing to do with why I meditated. It was just a regular old daily meditation. 

I hear time and time again that some pain can be due to us “holding onto something” or stress, or whatever, and I’ve never really bought it 100%. 

Perhaps through this experience, my mind might be changing. 

I just wanted to share this for anyone who is dealing with pain. I know it can be a hopeless and intrusive experience to be dealing with that. I’m not saying it can cure all pain, but maybe there is some hope for some relief.

One final thing to note. This meditation was an uncharacteristically “fruitful” meditation, I fell right into a nice state, was not too distracted, was able to clear the mind somewhat better than usual. Maybe that has something to do with it. Who knows!

Namaste! Peace and love",0
"I have been practicing meditation for a few months now. A few days ago I got this profound clarity in my mind. My mind was still chattering, but I could observe the thoughts effortlessly.

" We think meditation or any such practice will give us relief from the uneasiness of what we do not like or find irritating, confusing. It is only when you see that this uneasiness can not be thrown away from the mind that whole energy is concentrated here. 

Body and brain require food and sleep to recharge. This is sufficient, complete in itself. You are essentially at peace, at rest unless you are in immediate physical danger. Unless you recognize this fact-any practice, device as meditation and so on to bring peace and control is to seek relief by running away from what you do not like. Energy remains dissipated.  
 Q. - I have done meditation, read spiritual books, read your posts-but the discomfort does not go? It surfaces in one form or the other.

One essentially feels discomfort when one faces ‘what one does not like’. The discomfort can not be undone or removed or thrown away from the mind. If discomfort goes, life goes. Once you come to this, can you bear the discomfort and see the emergence of action. The whole energy is here.

Now one understands, sees the whole process-the discomfort stops troubling you. What you want or want to do in any situation becomes clear. You are in the limitless field where nothing stops, nothing stabilizes.",0
"I’m very very new to meditation. I’ve only done a couple serious sessions, ~5 minutes each. Usually what I’ve done is I’ll close my eyes, focus on my breathing, and try to imagine myself in a sort of space. Like surrounded by stars. Then I try to imagine the actual place I’m in at the moment, and then changing my surroundings into space and stars until I feel like I’m floating a little.

Does this have anything good to it? There probably isn’t an answer to this, but am I meditating right? Is there anything real to what I think I’m doing?

Also, what recommendations would you make for me?",0
"Been meditating two years, but inconsistently (2-3x week instead of daily). Now I'm trying to become consistent and have been for a week or two.

I realize how much happier when I'm able to catch my unawareness, and getting sucked into bad thoughts especially when I'm stressed or negative. I even understand the concept of thoughts and how we don't have to follow them.

But I can't seem to recognize the times I'm unaware, which is the idea of general mindfulness. I still get caught up and even if I recognize it (like saying ""oh that storyline again""), I can't seem to stop the inertia of the thoughts sometimes (ie recognizing I'm lost, but still going along with my thoughts).

Is there a type of meditation that will help with this muscle more or will it just take more time with consistent meditation)?

"For those of you that have had a major realization that began the true process of tearing your world, both physically and mentally, apart, how are you coping with reality now? I’m talking the real deal, a nuclear explosion that annihilates everything, that there is no going back from, not just emotional releases or big life changes that cause deep emotional reactions. Mine began when I saw Maya, the illusory world, with my physical eyes for the first time. Think Matrix. That was some scary shit and now its all I see. My eyes have never been the same. 

After settling in to my new paradigm small layers of the self began to crumble away because now that I had experienced that the outside world wasn’t real there was no place for the ego to hold on to. Some pieces left with an alleviating sense of release and others with the pain of being doused with acid or skinned alive. The big ones lasted for days or weeks sometimes and brought a loss that is very hard to explain other than calling it a personal death full of grief and sorrow. And they are still coming. 

Only now the layers are going deeper and it seems like my mind is melting away now too, just like the perceived physical world. My brain no longer functions the same as it’s became hard to think. I can only actually observe the process now that it has began and though I feel I made it happen with my strong meditative work I’ve lost any sense of control and it’s all falling away on its own now. I’m truly just the spectator of what seems to be total madness. 

The hardest part is dealing with what feels like a loss of sanity and general functions of the mind. Has anyone out there ever experienced anything similar? If so, whats your life like now? How are you coping with this total loss of the perceived idea of mind, reality, and self? I’m well aware that there is no self, but it’s hard to exist here as the observer while watching it be ripped apart and your mind melt away into goo. 

The free fall just goes deeper and deeper into nothing.",0
"I wanted to share with you guys what has been my experience with my meditation practice so far:

For the past 17 years, I have been meditating on and off (ego-flex) and recently have accidentally stumbled upon the vipassana type mediation.  It seems like everyday, with each meditation, I discover yet another emotional pattern that I was completely unaware/ ignorant of.  I am constantly astounded to find these flaws in my unconscious emotional programming that I wasn't and simply couldn't have been aware/ conscious of before.  This is the part of meditation that, to me, has been the biggest paradox.  You can't be aware of the unconscious thoughts you are having today that may be brought into conscious awareness during tomorrow's meditations.  This is why taking the time to sit quietly and listen/ look/ perceive/ feel inwardly-generated stimuli has been so meaningful to me in all areas of my life;  You cannot fix what you are not aware of, and each ""epiphany"" presents a new possibility to change/ modify your habits in the direction of happiness.  I'm starting to really enjoy this whole phenomenon of discovering sensations and emotional thought patterns I was completely unaware of.  I'm sure tomorrow I will discover new patterns that are currently going on within my mind today as i write this and will then take joy in the humbling process of being continually confronted with my own ignorance.  Sometimes it hurts my ego to be confronted with my own flaws, but I'd much rather find out about these flaws via meditation and force myself to change than to be stagnant and refuse to grow.",0

Sometimes I can relax by thinking about equanimity and at least keep my thoughts of aspects of my external life but this is far from focusing on simply breathing and sitting behind your thoughts rather than in them.

It is true in many saying, but here is the funeral chant that is commonly done at cremations, especially for monk cremations.

The following chant comes from [http://fellowdesigns.com/main/images/stories/palichanting\_urw\_csx\_short.pdf](http://fellowdesigns.com/main/images/stories/palichanting_urw_csx_short.pdf)

Aniccâ Vata Saïkhâra Uppâda Vayadhammino  
Uppajj1tvâ Nirujjhanti Tesaü Vûpasamo Sukho  
Conditions truly they are transient with the nature to arise and cease having arisen, then they pass away, their calming, cessation - happiness.

Sabbê Sattâ Maranti ca Marlüsu ca Marissarê  
All kinds of beings surely come to death, they have always died, will always die,

Tathevâhaü Marissâmi Natthi Mê Eta Saüsayo  
in the same way I shall surely die, about this there is no doubt.

Understanding death and our relationship to it and feelings about death, inspecting these feelings, we can be set free from the dread and fear that keeps us locked in hope for a another out. This is discussed in this video with Will, Ronny and Dhammarato.

I live in a noisy environment and need headphones so that I am not listening to random noises when meditating. I need silence but don't have the finances to have my own place atm.

"I did some searches on here as well as google and YouTube but not sure I'm understanding this correctly.

Should I aim to increase my meditation duration over time?
More importantly, is it common to get tired at a certain point, say 30 minutes and need to stop?
I've had many times where I feel like I got into a meditative state, feel calmer and more concentrated, and then 10 minutes later I feel almost like I suddenly cant concentrate on my breath anymore... it almost seems like a reversal.

Additionally, I've heard many teachers say it gets better over time, which makes it sound linear. But I've been meditating for 5 years and sometimes I have good sessions, and other times I cant get present to save my life (which I feel like I should be able to do at this point).",0
"Week 1- felt quite relaxing in the moment though I got very restless at times. (3-5 min)

Week 2- felt   happier but still quite agitated by people around me tending to be quite abrasive. 10 - 15 min.

Week 3, happier, less stressed and at ease throughout the day. But still overthinking and dwelling on thoughts. (15 min)

Week 4. Starting to finally understand what it means to notice my thoughts and using the idea throughout the day. Still getting the hang of it. (20 min minimum)",0
"Hello everyone. I'm 21 years old and have suffered from crippling anxiety most of my life. I have been diagnosed with GAD and get debilitating panic attacks almost daily. For the past few months, I have been getting immersed in the practice of mindfulness and meditation. However, it has been difficult for me to really get into it as I appear to become more anxious the more I meditate.

While I  do have become more confident and am living my life as best as I can, I notice that I am constantly on the edge of falling back into depression. Lately I have been having more trouble than ever to focus and also my body is suffering immensely from the constant state of anxiety I appear to find myself in subconsciously (tense muscles, nausea, headaches, dizziness). 

I just felt like I needed to reach out and explain what is happening with me instead of trying to deal with it myself and pretending that I am fine. I was wondering if any of you experience(d) something similar or whether you have any tips on mindfulness and meditation.

Thanks guys",0

"I started meditating this week to try to deal with my anxiety and grief (my mom  died in July) and it has helped a lot actually. But does anyone else experience seeing purple that sort of moves and swirls (especially upon inhalation) that turn in to some patters and then a bright white light appears in the distance? Sometimes it throws me off and I start to think too much when I see it and it will disappear. 

I also experience a slight headache or pressure between my eyes afterwards. Nothing terrible but I can definitely feel the pressure for a good hoe afterwards.",0
"Once a driving instructor asked me if I wore sunglasses while driving during the daytime. I answered ""Not always."" He told me that not wearing sunglasses during the day will cause impaired night vision. The worst part is that, while driving at night, you don't know what you are missing!  
  
I see this as an analogy of meditation. Those people who don't meditate, who live in the past and future instead of the present moment, don't realize what they are missing, which awareness, self-awareness, uncovers. They cannot be aware, or become aware, of those buried memories that must be dealt with for them to achieve happiness and peace*!* – Paine 🎯",0

"Today was my first experience of a long, formal sitting meditation. I went on a half day retreat at a zen centre. We had two 50 minute sitting sessions in addition to walking meditation. I am used to 5-10 minute sittings so this was quite an experience for me. Unfortunately, my mind wandered throughout each sitting. I tried to focus on counting my breath to no avail. Towards the end of the sittings, my back ached so much in addition to my legs in the half lotus position. I had to uncross my legs and sit up
straight with my feet dangling off the chair. 

I think one gain for me was the elimination of disturbing intrusive thoughts like things at work that really bother me. My mind still wandered today while sitting but it was more of a happy wandering (like being at the beach).

I’m not sure how to further eliminate wandering thoughts at this point except to recognize a thought train when I see it and not get on board for a ride. Also maybe try listening more to guided meditations.

Any further suggestions on reducing wandering thoughts and dealing with pain in the body while sitting? Thanks.",0

"I know that most of people have meditated for insane amounts of days in a row, but it's my highest streak so far (credits for waking up app, don't know if I would make it that far). So far I've noticed: 

1. Better awareness and less autopilot mode in life 
2. Better control if it comes to emotion (I mean it's not like I was impulsive before, but I'm more aware of this feeling I get and I get more control of it)
3. Experiencing stuff fully, that one is really hard to describe

"Hello, 

first time poster here

So I've been meditating on and off for a couple months now and tonight (30 mins ago) I felt an urge to feel good and feel like a child would feel (light, fresh, stress free, happy, content) so I sat on my bed in a Burmese position. Listen to some Tibetan bowls with my earphones so I could block outside noises (noisy family haha).   
Tried focusing on my breathing. A short while after i began to feel a light pressure between my eyebrows (third eye?) but I just let it be. Then, a weird body sensation took my focus away from my breathing and third eye to old memories.  


When i was little and had high fevers like +39°C (+102.2°F), before falling asleep, I would get this very discomforting and weird sensation in my body. I would feel my body inflated and shrunk at the same time. I have absolutely no words to describe such sensation, not even similar sensations to compare it to but I'm trying the best I can, so bear with me.   
I would feel like my soul was sinking inside of my body, more like my consciousness. My limbs would feel very large but at the same time I would feel myself very tiny inside of them. I would also get this weird taste and texture in my mouth. The only thing i could compare it to would be like synesthesia even tho I'm not sure what it feels like (I think I could feel a texture with my palate and smell)   
I could snap out of it at will but after a while I could feel it creep in again so falling asleep was very hard and discomfortable.  


So while meditating, I got the same sensation but not as intensely or at least, it wasn't uncomfortable. My body felt very big, specially my head, but not heavier!   
I would love to know if anybody has had a similar experience and if it's common 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : was meditating and had the same body sensation like when I had fever when I was a child",0

"Let me just say that I’m fairly new to meditation, about a year on and off and only really do it when I need to. I see a lot of posts on here that all talk about “awakening the third eye” or seeing this place called Maya and so on. Honestly, I don’t want to get there. Don’t get me wrong I love meditation as it’s helped me tremendously with coping with anxiety and stress by just taking a step back for a couple minutes but Im just not really into the spiritual aspect of it too much and would rather not go down that path if possible.

Is there specific meditations I should avoid for this?
If I meditate for a long enough time is this “awakening” something that I will have to deal with regardless? 
What is “awakening” and maya?",0

"So I have tried to get into meditation for some time now, and unsuccessfully.  I finally decided to give mindfulness a go(again) and after going a week straight felt something with it that I felt the first tangible benefit.

I've been a little stressed today, and didnt sleep well last night.  I sat down to meditate, closed my eyes and have any of you ever had that wound up feeling that you felt like you were ""swaying"" side to side but in reality you really arent moving? I had this at the start, but kept at it. Slowly that sensation subsided and left me just with an overwhelming calm I haven't felt before. 20 minutes later now sitting here typing this I really do feel great.

I know this may not be a new thing from most of you seasoned folks, but I have always been a person needing proof. Well I really feel like I got my proof today and I am definitely onboard to keep this up and see what other benefits I can find!",0
"Hi all. I've been meditating for a couple of months now, but not every day. I believe it's going to become a lifelong practice for me. However, I seem to be having some trouble staying comfortable long enough to finish my meditation. My meditation sessions will run from about 18-40 minutes. Somewhere in there. Sometimes I get deep into meditation and I don't really want to come out. And as such, I'd like to get your recommendations on staying comfortable. 

I started out trying to do what the monks do, just sitting on the bare floor. It's just too hard. So I then switched over to what some of the other monks do, which is to sit on top of a couple of pillows. This helped out a lot, but I still have an issue with circulation to my right foot. Towards the end of my meditation, my right foot will tingle and go to sleep. I hate that any time it happens. But as you know if you start shifting around trying to get comfortable, it starts bringing you out of meditation. Then it may take awhile to get back in as deep as you were. This is not ideal. 

If I meditate in my big comfortable recliner chair, then I can usually avoid the foot and leg discomforts. But since it's a recliner chair, I can't really keep my back straight. At least not very easily. This leads to me starting to fall asleep during meditation. Can't have that. So I'd just like to hear what you guys do, and your recommendations on how to stay comfortable enough to keep meditating for extended periods. I'd eventually like to get to the point where I can meditate all day long and not really notice that time has passed, similar to what a Yogi can do.",0
"Hello friends,

I am new to meditation. I am very anxious person and feel like I say/do things slightly based on external factors (trying to impress people, trying to paint a certain image of myself to others etc). I want to be true to myself. I think meditation is the first step towards this and I have felt progress  occasionally. My problem is that I don’t really know how to do it. E.g I search 30min for a guided meditation on Youtube and put the responsibility of having ”succesful” meditation on the guided meditation... Sounds weird maybe. I also don’t breath/inhale naturally, it almost feels like a task.

I hope some of you with more experience can help me with this. Should I meditate without any guidence/music? What tactics are there that I can use in the beginning before it starts coming to me naturally.

Than you in advance.",0
"Hi. I’ve been meditating for quite awhile now on and off. My longest everyday streak was a month back in June. Around that time, I felt vibrations all over my body probably once or twice, other then that I really just followed vipassana. I picked up the practice again about a week and a half ago and I’ve noticed my meditations are a lot stronger/sharper and I experience waves of euphoria about 8 minutes in. This has happened 3 times already. These waves are not just body vibrations. They come in waves and I feel it on my brain. It feels similar to taking pure mdma. I feel super cozy like someone just put a blanket over my brain. Anyone else?


I also wanted to add that I have been practicing r/semenretention since the beginning of the year. It could be that I’m transmuting my sexual energy as well.",0

I’ll preface this by saying I experimented with a lot of psychedelics many years ago. Does anyone else who has experience with psychedelics find that the realm we enter in deep meditation is remarkably similar to the come up of a trip? Or even people who have not tried any psychedelic drugs?

It feels almost like a mild dmt trip.

The experience is completely different, but I feel like I go to the same place

"Wanted to just share a video that I finally completed about everything that I learned: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmdc6Xm7LK0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmdc6Xm7LK0)

And if you don't want to watch the video here's the written part: I recently completed a 10 day meditation retreat. 

One where you are supposed to find out about yourself. Where you achieve enlightenment, where you don't speak to anyone for 10 days and you really get to know yourself. And you get to find out what really matter to you. 

But the reality is, it's a lot of you trying to focus on your breath, and the feelings in your body, but primarily you realize just how little control over your mind you have. 

You’re focusing on your breath, and then you’re thinking about how your leg hurts. Then you’re thinking about how long this session has been, then you’re wondering if everything is okay at home. And then you realize that you’ve spent the last 10 minutes not worrying about your breath and just getting pulled in whatever direction your mind wanted to go. 

This was a common occurrence during the retreat, and to be honest, one of the reasons we need to go. So that we can see how our mind works, and so we can learn about ourselves. 

Now I had heard through numerous friends that the retreat was life changing. That you’ll discover what truly matters to you. You’ll organize everything in your life. You’ll know what you need to stop doing, or do more of. What you actually care about. 

But I also heard that you shouldn’t have expectations, or you’d be outcome dependent. And you should just let the meditation teach you what you’re meant to be taught. 

So these were my expectations going in. To have no expectations. To trust the process, and to let go. 

I’ll explain what I *actually* learned in this meditation retreat, but first I’d like to tell you a little bit about the retreat so you know what to expect. 

First and foremost, there’s a lot of meditation. 

Who would have thought? There’s about 7-8 hours of meditation per day. Starting at 4:30 in the morning.  

To start the retreat, you’re expected to take 5 precepts, to maintain your Sila, which is hindi for Morality.   

Abstain from killing

Abstain from stealing 

Abstain from sexual activity 

Abstain from telling lies 

Abstain from all intoxicants

It seems easy enough, right? You aren’t talking so you can’t really tell lies. This is why noble silence is in place, because we will lie without even meaning to. 

And how often do you kill throughout the day? That’ll be no problem. But you’d be surprised how hard it is to maintain this precept when you’re lying in bed trying to sleep and there’s a mosquito flying beside your ear. 

Where your entire being wants to just slap it and end the problem for good. But now you have to delicately cup it in your hands and carry it out to the hallway. 

So those are the precepts and the whole purpose of the retreat is to acquire wisdom. The wisdom to realize that everything rises, and passes away. And that change is constant. 

But there are three types of wisdom, or panna. And not all panna is equal. Here’s a story: Say you’re starving to death and you go into a restaurant. The waiter gives you the menu and you peruse it over. The food looks so delicious, so tasty in the pictures. The descriptions are great. You have cinta - maya - panna. Wisdom gained by intellectual understanding. The menu looks good.   

While you’re waiting for food, you look around at all the happy families already eating. They all are smiling and enjoying their meals. You have suta maya panna - wisdom gained by listening to others. 

And then finally your meal comes and you get to dig in. And oh my lord is it ever good. Everyone was right. You know have bhavana maya panna - wisdom gained from direct personal experience. 

And this level of wisdom is the deepest kind. The wisdom that everything rises and passes away and that nothing is good or bad. It’s easy to understand intellectually, but we needed to go deep, and we needed to gain this understanding on our own. 

So the meditation has you sharpening your awareness, so you are able to pick up subtle sensations throughout your body and watch them rise, and pass away. 

This is something you’ll do on the meditation retreat. You spend 10 long, long days doing this. And to tell you the truth, it was the longest 10 days of my life. 

I didn’t get any of the wisdom that I was told would happen. My entire life didn’t get put into order. When i came out, i didn’t have unlimited focus for working on projects. 

But here’s what I did get: During this long 10 days, I spent a lot of time just feeling like this will last forever, that I’m never going to get out of this, and that I can’t wait to talk again or see my family again, but it felt like that would never happen. 

But when i came out of the retreat, I realized that it was actually temporary. And that everything, is temporary, and that is very freeing. It made me more capable to take risks in my life, because I now have the wisdom that everything really does rise and pass away. 

And this helped me to break down the barriers that i have in my life that are stopping me from going after what I want. I used to have fear, but now I can understand that everything is transient and even if i put myself in a nerve wracking situation, that too, like everything else, will pass. So may as well face your fears. 

The meditation retreat never taught me the things I was told it would, and I didn’t ever fully surrender and achieve enlightenment. But the benefits that i did get have resonated within me and helped in my life. I would recommend a retreat to anyone, even if it’s just to see what you’re made of. To prove to yourself that you’re capable of anything that you set your mind to. That’s the real benefit that i received from the meditation retreat. I can tell you that coming out of something as difficult as this, I definitely felt confidence that I could tackle bigger and scarier things, and felt the courage to attempt them.",0
"Every time I sit down to meditate I really don’t know what I’m expecting, right now I’m at a huge crossroads in my life and I think meditation is in order but I’ve never meditated before and want to start.

All other assertions of thinking - (Why I do not get desired results despite my best efforts? Why our relationships do not remain smooth? Why there is negativity all around? Why one is stressed?

And so on)-in the form of any answer give you relief from the discomfort the moment is showing. One is trapped in securing this relief. The touch of the Original is missed.

Dependence upon explanations, practices create the impression as if (psychological) discomfort will be removed from the mind. Energy remains dissipated.",0

"Hi all! Thank you for your time :)

With 10 years of overthinking (as many of you I guess), which led to anxiety/panic attacks/derealization I can totally say that meditation is helping me a lot!There are a few struggles though:

* As I keep doing this I'm noticing that it's getting more and more difficult! I mean, it seems that in the first months I could keep my focus on the breath more easily. Now? I have a turbolence of intricate thoughts and as soon as I rest my attention on the breath it immediately ""morphs"" to another image. Then I notice it, label it, return to the breath and here it goes again immediately. I'm accepting them as they rise and I try not to resist them, but why are them that many now?
* During the day, when I realize I'm distracted, should I focus on just one thing (breath, activity) or should I try to experience the whole range of senses?
* As I mentioned before, I was used to experience dissociative disorders. Now I feel more grounded but it's still pretty rare for me to sense clarity and depth when I look at something or experience something. When I do, it's great, but when I don't it's like I'm watching it through a filter that evens/fogs it out. Any suggestion on how to improve the clarity moments?

"I sit on a chair, relax my body, and keep my back straight, kind of arched. I close my eyes and start breathing through my nose. I focus on the the breathing through my nose and nothing else. If I get a thought, I take notice and focus back on the breathing. Is this how you do it? New to this",0
"So I've been trying to meditate for a while now, but I don't really know if I'm doing it ?

I'm kinda just sitting there, unable to feel my hands, and thinking about stuff ? I don't really understand if I'm supposed to watch the breath or watch my thoughts (how do you even do that by the way). It all seems incredibly confusing, especially since there's no frame of reference..",0

"Emotions commonly manifest through physical sensations, if you have a sensation in your body and you associate it with an specific story, memory, emotion, trauma, etc, you will condition these feelings to the physical sensation as well.

The human body is a very complicated system that is in constant motion, change and a never ending cascade of chemical processes, most of them we don't even have control or awareness of.

If you feel something in your body, evaluate it for what it actually is, a physical sensation.
Do you get a cramp on your abdomen? or a pain in your left arm? Identify these primitive physical sensations that we are unable to control for what they truly are: primitive physical sensations that we are unable to control.

The fact that you regularly meditate has been training your brain to accomplish this task, you are already a good step ahead.

In my personal experience and during my own meditation I've noticed time and time again the truth about how my body has been keeping the score of what has emotionally happened to me in the past. I consider myself a prime example of how to handle these sensations in the worst possible way because I was adding tons of emotional context to a given physical sensation, which is no different from contaminating an open wound.

Physical sensations are not books, they don't need you to treat them as such.

Acknowled them without getting involved with them, let them be. In due time, they will stop happening.",0

"Been a mediator for few years now. In recent past I'm having very strange experience during meditation. I close my eyes and start slow but deep breathing. About 15-20 mins into meditation, (by then I'm into deep meditative state), I suddenly start to see extremely bright flash of light, right in center of eye brows. It's just a very tiny dot that randomly appears but it's so bright that I feel, as if, a nuclear missile is piercing through my forehead. It would be there for a fraction of second, but the effect it creates is so profound, that my entire body starts to shake as if I'm being electrocuted. But, it feels so blissful that words are not enough to describe the experience and I keep shivering for almost 2-3 mins in pure bliss / ecstasy. I end up crying (with joy of course) some times and after effect this experience is just amazing. Thing is, this not an isolated experience that I had. Recent past such occurrences have become quite often and very much repetitive. Initially I thought that it may have been a random experience, but as I had such experience very often, I conclude that it's definitely not random.

"While meditating, I was able to observe that the sensations over my head, the vibrations dominate much of the awareness. If I'm body scanning, I'm able to observe the sensations all over my body, but when I remain latent, most of the immediate sensations I observe are the vibrations from the brain. The characteristics of all thoughts of cravings lead to a physical sensation at the forehead, the same goes with aversion. Anybody else had this experience?",0

"Hello, 
I have the problem that often; when I’m about to do something - that my voice tells me i have to do it. This causes a pressure and it makes it worse.

Example , 

- I have to sleep. 
- Thought : you have to sleep 
- Outcome : I’m more awake and nervous 


or 

I have to make a presentation 
- thought: Don’t be nervous for this presentatation 
- outcome : I’m nervous 

this goes along with many other things. Times when you have to “perform” 

How do I manage this? Is mediation a way to get rid of it ? Are there some techniques for it ?

"Hi All,

Noobie here, I feel my meditation is definitely progressing but I have a couple basic questions and I apologize if these have been answered before. I've read a lot of this form about observing your thoughts without judgement. Sometimes I find myself trying not to think and focusing on my breath and I feel great but the thoughts slowly keep creeping back in. Should I just let them loose and stop trying to fight it? Also, how do you imagine yourself ""observing"" your thoughts in the 3rd person? Lastly, how important is posture verses comfort-ability. I have a leather reclining chair but I have been sitting up in it with my back straight, should I continue to do this or should I sacrifice posture for comfort?",0

"I see the word ""ruminating"" thrown around a lot in meditation discussions. It seems to usually be used in a negative way, as if it's something to avoid.

I always sort of figured ""meditation"" and ""rumination"" meant the same thing (to ponder deeply on something), but it seems to be different in terms of actual meditation practice.

Can someone explain to me?",0
"First thing to do when your learning meditation is to not get caught up in thoughts by not contradicting why they exist and mainly not adding extra energy towards them. The basic goal is to clear your mind but it cannot be done intellectually. If I tell you to fall asleep you won't be able to do it. You have to Fall into meditation not go into meditation.

Leaving thoughts alone is not easy at the start because our mind does not work at the level of ""addition"" and ""subtraction"". It can multiply and divide something. Hense by trying to suppress or trying not to think of something only amplifies the thought you're trying to run away from.

The best tip to just observe the thoughts is to let the thoughts be just the way they are till will come and they will go by starting to not get involved with them, they won't rule your attention

Using an app like headspace will help a lot. Try doing the free 10-day Headspace Basics they explain a lot of fundamental things. If the basics are there things a lot easier.",0

"You guys, I'm in some serious trouble. I've never considered myself to be an angry or ragey individual, but competitive conditions turn me into the biggest bastard I've had the displeasure of witnessing. It's one of the greatest faults of mine that I'm embarrassed about. Throughout my life, I've always admired individuals who could keep a cool head in stressful conditions and make the best of any given situation. I've idolized these people. But I just can't seem to follow their example. Whenever things start to get rough, my body pumps me full of adrenaline and other chemicals and I just start spiraling down his metaphorical stairway of self-loathing and constantly decreasing performance. I can't handle it anymore and this part of make makes me genuinely disgusted with myself. 

Which brought me to the topic of meditation. Some really successful athletes and competitors engage in meditation and it really seems to help their performance. I'm trying to get into it as well but the online guides are not quite clear on this stuff. I just sit for at least ten minutes a day and breathe? Do I actively try to think about something? Think about nothing? How do I do this? And if I master it, will it make me zen as fuck? I want to be an immovable mountain of mental, Buddha's long lost son. Is that something I can attain via meditation? Or am I just condemned to a life of being a little stressed out bitch because of unfortunate DNA combinations?

"Hi, 

Lately, I've been practicing meditation by observing the natural breath and then moving on to body sensations. It's come to my notice that I am sleeping early and I wake up early too. Yesterday, I slept at 10 pm and woke up at 3 am. That's 5 hours of sleep. Even the five hours of sleep that I had, was almost about the sensations I felt. The thing is, it felt different. It felt like I had no deep sleep. I'm not sure if this affects my daily behavior if it's a positive attribute of meditating or a negative one.",0

"As a psychology student and meditator, I’m wondering if there’s any scientific research on which meditation techniques are most effective. It’s not that I want to condemn any technique, but if we want to gain the benefits of meditation and certain techniques are better than others, it makes sense that we ought to use science to discover which meditation techniques are most effective. 

The techniques I would like to compare are: Transcendental, mindfullness, and vipassana. Having practiced all three, I would expect theme to rank from least effective to most effective in that order. By effective I mean purify and calm the mind. 

Are there some more techniques for us to consider? What do you think of my choice of ranking? Any ideas on scientific studies of meditation? 

Thank you",0

I became neurotic as fuck having tried super hard on my career path and seeing no results after so long.

"I've been doing a mindfulness breathing meditation 5 days per week for about a month now. Usually for 10 minutes. However I often check my timer during the meditation when I get antsy and want to know how long I have left. It's not mindful. I also often scratch my face or my hair or reposition myself from sitting to laying to sitting again because experiencing all the sensations is so uncomfortable.

Yesterday I couldn't make it through my 15 minute sit and was very frustrated. 

Today I set a timer for 12 minutes and made it the entire time barely moving an inch. It was pretty amazing to feel the sensations arise and then disappear again. However amazing as it was it was also extraordinarily difficult and painful. 

I am very proud and it was very powerful to sit through it all, but the idea of doing 12 minutes again seems very difficult even though I just accomplished it not 5 minutes ago. 

Is it wise to reduce the time while adhering to this much more strict practice of not moving an inch, say starting at 5 mins and building up a minute each day?

Or should I just do 13 minutes tomorrow? Any thoughts?",0

"I am relatively new to mediation, and have recently transitioned from following Headspace to participating in a weekly class with a teacher, which has been mindblowing in its difference. A few weeks ago our teacher introduced us to black &amp; white breathing; during that time I began to feel a spreading warmth coming from my core (not sure how else to explain it?), which ended slowly a few minutes after we were done the meditation. Every time since, but only when doing black &amp; white breathing, I find I experience this warm, cozy feeling that starts off gradually and then increases and spreads. I've never experienced this before, but after reading the FAQs am wondering if this is just a distraction of my mind? Or is this a positive development of my meditation practice? Not sure what I'm hoping to get with this question, but any advice would be helpful as I am so new to this. Thank you muchly!",0
"I woke up this morning without struggle. Sunlight fell on my eyes, raising me from sleep and I did not fight it. I took my shower, brushed my teeth, and dressed for the day in peace and quiet. No anxieties about what today might hold or ruminations about what transpired yesterday. 

Breakfast is next on my schedule. I like bacon and eggs every morning that I have time to make it. I put on the coffee, and cook the food. Coffee smells wonderful while it is brewing, bacon sounds like morning rain, and eggs are still challenging to make the way I like. 

Breakfast is ready and I eat it outside on the back porch in the sunlight. I do not feel the need to be distracted by a book, TV show, or podcast. There is no place I would rather be than right here, right now, alive and eating. 

Time for class. Chemistry is difficult, but I am focused in lecture. What matters right now is the material, not what I got on the last exam or when my next one is. I lose myself in the beauty of science. 

Now to study. I can use this time to plan ahead, instead of stressing about it in class or at home. I plot out my future exams and due dates without too much worry.

Time for calculus. I get my quiz back and I know the grade was what I deserved. Move on to the material. A peaceful mind is a fertile garden for math. I lose myself in the beauty of math. 

Lunch time. I go home and eat a sandwich. The day is moving along now and I might read a book with lunch. Time is precious!

Time for chemistry lab. My favorite part of the school week. I arrive on time and eager, set up my lab station, and begin to work. The work goes on for three hours, but I might as well have been in there for a half hour. 

After lab I finally go home for the day. I cook dinner and with it I might watch a movie, lecture, or concert video. I've earned as much after the day. 

Before bed, I meditate. It takes some time, but the skittering trains of thought dissipate until my mind is left in quiet. 

I go to sleep with a clear head and wake up in the morning with the same.

EDIT: I mean not every day is like this... I’ve just been having good days lately!",0
"For sometime something within me has felt ""off"". I felt drawn to meditation, as some sort of remedy perhaps. When reading the FAQ I gravitated towards metta / loving kindness. 

For the past week I've been sending metta only to myself. My first session I cried. Since, my awareness of my thoughts has increased and it sadness me to say but I feel like I fundamentally think from a place of sadness, fear and hurt. I'm on the defensive. 

I usually feel low after my sessions have finished but somehow feel there is some benefit, even if it's just the ability to be more honest with myself. My thoughts and ways of thinking weren't that clear to me before starting metta. 

I hope I'm on the right path and one day I'll feel lovingkindess towards myself. I also realise metta is just one piece of the puzzle to improving my relationship with myself.",0
I’ve been wanting to start meditating regularly and I’ve done mindfulness stuff before so I kinda know some stuff about it. I just did my first session with headspace and I was maybe halfway through and I felt like I was spinning. I’ve had vertigo in the past that wakes me from my sleep and makes me throw up and this was too familiar.  I tried to block it out but it got stronger and I did not want to get sick so I opened my eyes and it was gone.  So I thought it was a fluke and closed my eyes again and it instantly started again.  I just tried to ignore it again until it got intense and I needed to confirm that it wasn’t actually happening again.  Same thing happened and it stopped as soon as I opened my eyes. I have been able to lucid dream a lot and I don’t even try anymore and I’ve enjoyed lucid dreaming a lot. Could that have anything to do with this feeling with meditation.  The spinning is accompanied by lightheaded ness and I did think it was my breathing so I made sure to focus on that more and make sure it wasn’t just me hyperventilating but the sensation continued throughout the rest of the session.  The time flew by and seemed like nothing at all so I’ll be continuing but I was wondering if anyone has had similar things happen to them where the sensation doesn’t carry over when you open your eyes. If anyone knows what this might be or has advice that would be great!,0

"Hi everyone, 

There is no doubt about the benefits of meditation. Its scientifically proven fact. However, can you please elaborate on those idea 

1) how can I, when in anger or negative state, bring my mind to sit and focus on my breathing (now) without feeling my brain chatter and anxiety. 

2) how can I feel that for only 5 minutes a day meditating, my life would change for the better. I just cannot see the correlation. Since 5 minutes is only a short part of my whole 24 hours a day cycle. So 4-5 hours later from my session, I could get angry or something.

"**Perception is a representation of reality but can never be a reality, but it exists within the realm of reality so it is a reality.**

My Friends, This may seem like a paradox. The question here is do you want to be finite or infinite? Limited or Unlimited?

Consciousness is not a perception of life;  But Perception emerges from Consciousness. By consciously dissolving the perception to become absolutely ""Dynamic"" with the life process which is everything that you can be aware of this moment will allow perception to merge with life, it will allow perception to fall into consciousness to a point where perception does not exist but just consciousness remains. Just as the fog clears and the light becomes clearer.

**""Dynamic State""** **simply means that you are able to flow with water of creation by collapsing the dams within your mind.** In reality, you're always flowing but not consciously aware due to creating **""Rigid""** perceptions that is nothing but dualistic contradiction caused by miss aligning with the dynamic flow of consciousness. One such example is thinking about the past and future tense.

By living in perceptions upon perception may seem complex but you're only limiting your own awareness to be finite. By being in the dynamic state your transcending dualism and aligning your self towards life.

Once you start becoming Dynamic by being consciously aware of life more and more things will reveal about **""Now""** / **""Present""**

**Now your perception is the same as absolute reality. Seeing things just the way they are without any false representations.**",0
"I've been picking up on some background chatter in my meditations recently. Every time I noticed them, I would realize they didn't make any sense. In my session today, I realized that I could recreate a similar chatter by just starting with any word and immediately coming up with the next words from the first thing that pops in my head, exactly like autocorrect.

Here are some examples:

""The tea leaves fall daintly from the walls corner.""

""Hypogenic states come from all pieces of time.""

""Happiness is a great undoing of society.""

Has anyone had this before? I know it's nothing to worry about it, but I'm curious how this mechanism works, from a psychological pov. I'm a very verbal thinker and I wonder if my internal speech stops making sense when I stop giving it the resources of effort and focus. In that case, it's almost like neurons firing at random, without any conscious control, which is why I get word associations that make it sound like autocorrect.",0

"He’s a pretty normal dude who’s one of our best friends. He’s super smart and he’s hilarious when he opens up but sometimes you can tell he isn’t happy or isn’t present when we’re hanging out. Tbh he can be kind of a downer sometimes, but we love him.

"Hello, I've been really into mindfulness lately, from daily meditation to therapy to reading books and it's helped so much in understanding my anxiety.

So once I got my hands on The Untethered Soul after reading so many good reviews I was very excited. But to tell you the truth, I couldnt get past the first few pages without it triggering some anxiety within me. When it started talking about the ""voice in my head"" that he believes is what can cause someone's anxiety. And how he says to say something in your head, then goes on to explain how that is not you. I began thinking ""oh great theres voices in my head"" lol and you may see where this is going lol. So now every time I meditate and I start observing my thoughts I end up getting anxious when I start ""talking to myself"", i think oh this is not me even though I'm actively thinking of the words, and it just spirals from there.

So for those who read the book, can you explain more about this voice the author is referring too. And does he mean literally anytime you think of anything in your head it is not you? 

I understand that negative thoughts and ruminating thoughts are come and go not by your choice, that I've accepted and its helped me alot. But when it comes to actively thinking and saying things ""in your head"". I begin to worry 'is that also not by my choice?' Since that ""voice"" is not me. When I'm doing math homework is it not me that is rattling off these formulas in my head?


Hopefully you understand my dilemma I'm in. I really want to continue and read the whole book but it seems everytime I try to understand the who ""voice"" thing my anxiety starts to raise and I get confused.

"So I am a college student, and I have been trying to meditate every day for the past month. I usually do about 10-15 min in the morning and then about 30 min to fall asleep at night. I've missed a few days, but overall I've tried to stick to my plan. I hadn't realized many changes to my overall mindset, but I was hopeful positive changes would come.

I'm currently taking a super difficult class and the first midterm exam was last week. I really really studied for it; went to all the office hours, created study guides, made flashcards of every note. At one of the professor's office hours, a few students and I were collaboratively working on solving problems. After the session finished, two of the students came up to me and wanted me to join their study group because 'you know the material better than anyone in there'. I joined their study group and was feeling like I would score pretty good on this exam. 

And today the exam results were posted and I earned a whopping 30%. 

The first thought that flashed into my mind was absolute shock and terror, but then my brain stopped and I thought about the Buddha quote 'The past is already gone, the future is not yet here. There's only one moment for you to live, and that is the present moment.' 

I think that means it's working?",0
"Hey guys, I want to boost my EQ. Is there a specific type of meditation that can do this?",0

Since i woke up i feel like there is something wrong. It is probably something i dreamt of but i can't get rid of this feeling for hours now. Is there any tips you can give me to clear my mind. Thanks.,0
"While doing sitting meditation, the middle of my chest has a type of pressure or a kind of pain in it. I am overweight so I wonder if this has something to do with it.   Just curious if anyone else has experienced this.   Thanks",0
"So there I was, sitting on the floor, about three or so minutes in to my usual session when I start feeling a little different. Usually I just do long breaths, counting to 30 and back down while checking on the rest of the body while meditating, but I decided to just go with the flow after I settled in. Next thing I know, my perception feels all weird. Best way I can describe it was it being like sliding your fov setting all the way up. It felt like my point of reference was sliding back and away from my head until my body was smaller and smaller. Little things like my stomach growling would kind of remind me I was still sat on the flood, but it was altogether weird. Anyone else have a similar experience or am I slowly going insane?",0
"So I’m my meditation course last night my teacher discussed ‘the secret’. She said ‘everyone knows what this is right?’

I foolishly agreed with the rest of the class that I did know....I don’t! 

Is there anyone out there that can explain?",0
"Sorry if this sounds stupid.

I notice I get very calm in the latter stage of a meditation session. Its pretty noticeable as my deep breathing becomes more automatic and my heart beats slower. I was just curious as to how or why this happens? I practice mindfulness meditation using my breath as a focus point. 

Could the calmness be because of my deep slow breathing thus leading to more oxygen in my body. Or maybe because  the longer I go in a session the quieter and less frequent my thoughts become thus calming my mind, leading to a overall calmness in the rest of my body. 

This calm feeling is something I only feel when meditating. Throughout the day my heart is usually beating fast and when I become aware of my breath I'll notice it's always short shallow breathing.",0
Meditation is relaxing but I don't think I'm achieving the state of mind I should be. I had good experience and was very relaxed only once. could you give me better instructions on how to meditate correctly. Also do binaural beats help.,0
"This has probably been asked before, but I’m new to meditation and am wondering, if we are meant to spend everyday living in the moment, doesn’t that take away drive or ambition by not thinking of the future sometimes? 

I know this is probably a stupid question but it would be great if someone could help me out with this. Are we meant to live presently every second of the day, or is it more about taking some time out of your day to still the mind?",0
"Is meditation (reaching deep states) a skill you gather and lock forever like riding a bike, skiing or driving a car?  
Or is it really possible to lose all progress?",0
I’ve been trying to do deep breathes for the longest of times but it’s almost like I cant. I have horrible back issues and my back is out of alignment which makes it hard for my stomach to come out. Whenever I try deep breathing it feels as if I’m making my back issues worse in a way and I’m unsure of what to do,0
"Hi everyone. I realize there is a growing body of scientific literature about the health benefits of meditation. However, if you search the internet you also see a lot of ""information"" about how meditation can be harmful in some individuals - as in worsening anxiety or depression. My question is, is anyone aware of any actual literature or research that shows these negative side effects? I guess I'm trying to figure out if a website promoting meditation would need to have a disclaimer about possible side effects or are these negative side effects just speculation or unstudied personal experiences without scientific backing.

For example, I believe Headspace got in trouble a while back for making claims about meditation's health benefits with aggressive marketing techniques towards the elderly and was fined by the FTC. On the other hand, most physical ""alternative/homeopathic"" health products at the store are okay to sell with un-founded health claims with ""not evaluated by the FDA"" disclaimers as long as the product doesn't cause any actual harm (FTC allows this). I guess I'm kind of edging on the legal side of things, but I'm not sure how meditation, as a product such as what headspace sells, wouldn't be allowed to have the same type of disclaimers that physical alternative health products have - but this would also depend on if meditation could possibly have negative side effects, and if those side effects have been in studies.

Anyway, back to my question: is there any actual evidence about meditation causing unwanted side effects? Thanks!",0
"Hello friends, first I would like to say I am so grateful for all of you posters in this sub. Thank you. 
I been meditating everyday (with a few oops days) for about 8 months. 20 minutes every morning using a combination of noticing breath and silent repetition of phrases that I've made up which I find to be inspiring and helpful to to me personally.
 I just finished reading Conquest of Mind by Easwaran and it was a very inspiring read to say the least and I highly recommend it.  In the book the author is quite specific about what a mantram should be and basically tells you that your mantram should be chosen from a list he gives. I'm conflicted by this as I feel I've had great results from my meditation practice in which I use my personal mantram. 
I would love to get some thoughts from others on this topic.",0

We definitely know on this subreddit that meditation has almost endless benefits to your personal health if done right.  But what if you found out that you could join a mass meditation and not only heal yourself, but actually help bring peace and healing to the planet?

The above link is one very effective mass meditation that, if you take part in, will surely help move our planet closer to a timeline of world peace. Please give it a chance and try it out. 

Meditating certainly isn't the only way you can help to create peace. There is much that needs to happen in the physical realm as well. But a 15 minute mass meditation can't hurt! Heres some proof of the positive effects of mass meditation on the community:

 You can do the meditations on this site, even if it is not the exact time of  the meditation schedule. There are also many other different mass meditations on the home page of the website I linked.

The following two links are a few free pages about how to do the merkaba meditation (recreating your human lightbody)-

And this is the updated version straight from the book:

This meditation, if done while feeling love energy, will release negativity and blockages from your chakras and open them up, thus restoring proper energy flow in your body, and improving your health. It can also change your consciousness to a higher dimensional awareness of peace, love and harmony with all life everywhere.


I highly suggest giving this meditation a try. Here is a guided audio link on YT of the merkaba meditation:




https://youtu.be/81Kf3UBQ1g8




Its from the book ""the ancient secrets of the flower of life part 2"".  The book also teaches spiritual anatomy of your 13 chakras,  healing, psychic powers, how to cast out entities/demons from your energy field, how to reconnect to mother earth,  the cosmos and your higher self,  and talks about a few intergalactic conspiracies and the current great awakening!


Here's a few pages from the book about the Lucifer experiment and how we can stop judgment and transcend this duality:

Here is another very useful meditation called the unity breath. It goes hand in hand with merkaba meditation. It will allow you to tap into a stream of infinite healing love energy:

"This is my greatest fear when it comes to energetic development, and it is very common it seems in proponents of Nofap and semen retention. I don't disapprove of such activities, in fact I think they can be highly valuable, but it seems many people either through meditation and/or practising semen retention/Nofap build more energy then they are capable of dealing with, and it leaks out into way over the top creepy behavior and excessive marvelling over oneself, often with complete ignorance, gaining this sort of attitude of always being the teacher and never taking anything to heart other than themselves.

Whether you agree with me or not, I'm not really concerned, but for those of you that do, you know what I am talking about. I would like to have some physical copy of a guide or something in proximity throughout my life, so that when I read it I can get a wake up call and adjust my behaviour accordingly. Perhaps a guidebook to good conduct as a spiritual practitioner or something, or perhaps even covering spiritual mania!

Does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks !",0
"I believe I have experienced a breakthrough which has come from through my mediation practice. 

I have always been one to get upset when I feel evenly slightly threatened. This can be by a comment of any kind, whether its intentions are benign or not. 

Recently, I have become aware that these comments that normally cause me to get upset are a result of feeling my ego attacked. Having become aware of this has allowed me to see things and hear things  for what they are without my ego. This has helped with my marriage tremendously because I now am aware of when my ego is threatened (for illogical reasons), and continue with a constructive dialogue. 

I feel as though walking through the world being aware of my ego has allowed me to be free of it. I realize all of these things that I used to do simply for my ego. The veil has been lifted. 

I hope I can continue on this path.",0

I try to gently “let it go” but it just creeps back in so easily!",0
"I suffer from depression and anxiety. There's no doubt that for many, consistent meditation practice is a great tool to help. However, being an anxious person, I've been reading about people who have have complete breakdown for meditation and have suffered for years afters. Sure, many of these people went on 10-day retreats when they weren't ready, but there's cases of people having breakdowns even without retreats.

As a fairly ' vulnerable' person, are there any precautions I can take to protect myself from the (small) chance that this could happen to me? I plan to use both mindfulness and chanting meditations, building up to a maximum of 15 minutes per day. Thank you.",0
"Hi, 

So while I was meditating, casually starting off with observing my breath and then later moving to my body sensations, I had tremendous insight into the past, which was personal. It was about the kind of partner I had chosen and why I chose them. It was very revealing. But what I'm not quite sure is, if it was indeed a part of the meditation or was it that I was distracted, that I had come up with this?",0
"Hi all, I have been meditating for more than three years now. I have recently been extremely consistent and focused in my practice.

Has anyone experienced this? Any thoughts?",0

Something I can do on my lunch break and when I’m home from work, because sitting and browsing my phone isn’t very stimulating and I feel like I could be doing more. But I always think about the hobby, writing for example, and sort of psych myself out. I think “I don’t know what to write” or “I’ll never be a good writer” or compare myself unfairly to others. And it deters me from actually doing it. I can’t seem to shake these thoughts even after centering myself. 

Does anyone have tips? Again, I’m somewhat of a novice so I figured I’d ask here.",0

"Hello world,
There are times that I found myself being out of tune. To elaborate, I am 21 years old and I study in my local uni, I had a wonderful experience when I started meditation, I could feel lighter, happier and more focus but as the time went by I can not seem to get myself in order. I am lazy, I stopped meditating and I came Back to my old monkey-obeying self. Do you have any suggestions for me to get Back on track?",0
"I recently got an article published at Mindful Magazine and thought I'd ask this community for feedback: [https://www.mindful.org/binge-watching-the-stories-in-your-head/](https://www.mindful.org/binge-watching-the-stories-in-your-head/)

"So I know that there are thoughts in my head as surely as writing this. And they are about the same. They are words. 

Well. When I meditated with my eyes closed when I first began meditating I found beneath these words there were images and symbols and pictures. 

And then I found beneath those images there was silence and space. 

Now, for mindfulness meditation (either sitting or walking around just living) I've found it more difficult to find space between thoughts. Yet still I often find I am mindful in a way that I am simply being. That I don't have any verbal thoughts in my mind (to watch. They just aren't there). 

BUT! I think even though I am in a space between thoughts and I am fully present, there still seems to be a landscape of feelings and impressions and not images, but ideas etc, sort of a subconscious thinking. 

I think that meditating has built a bridge between these conscious (verbal) thoughts and these unconscious (not verbal) thoughts. And actually it's kind of shitty. Because they are generally uncomfortable. 

Now it just occurred to me that I can also watch there unconscious (imagery not verbal) thoughts as I do with my conscious (verbal) thoughts. That I can step back and allow them as well. Only they are sort of nebulous. So I am not sure how that will go. Sorry. Seriously. Just stepped back to look at this unconscious landscape. 

My question is: can anyone else relate? I never hear anyone else talk about this second layer of thoughts that doesn't use words. Actually I think it's two more layers. 

Words/verbal 
Imajery/symbols
Feelings/intimations of memories

Anyway. I can't be the only one who has noticed this. 

Do you have thoughts underneath your thoughts that aren't verbal?",0
"I'm trying to be as good as I can possibly be at rock climbing, which requires mental calmness and clarity under pressure.

"During my last meditation session, involuntarily I started humming. As I was breathing in and out, my breathing became more vocal. At the same time, I was so relaxed that it felt like I was in a deep sleep: I could hear myself but I wasn’t awake enough to open myself and stop the loud breathing.

"I don’t know how else to explain this but sometimes when I’m listening to a guided meditation and the person says something like “you’re walking down a hallway” my mind allows me to picture the hallway and start walking down it but then I lose focus and my mind puts me somewhere else or removes me from the hallway.

"when I was a child, I had a little chick,one day he slept on my lap,very close to my belly, and I did my best to stay still, because he was sleeping so peacefully.

Now, I can’t meditate. I don’t even want to. It’s like I’m repulsed by the idea of clearing my head and living in the moment. I need distractions to fill my head every waking hour, because if I don’t I am afraid I will only be filled by nothing but the weight of the loss.

Is this normal?",0
"Hello! As the title says, I think I have ruined meditation for myself. For the first part, when I try to not have expectations or try not to thing of something, I do and I cant seem to get out of the loop. I also have trouble focusing on things because when I try to focus, I bring it up as a thought in my head and it feels so forced, and I try to accept it and push it away but sometimes it even hurts my brain, and some thoughts just get forced away. I know yall are gonna be talking about how this is normal, but I dont thinkt my situation is. I think i have turned meditation into something bad, after every meditation i feel no more calm whatsoever, sometimes even worse. Back to the forcing thoughts away thing, it creates a weird feeling up in the top of my head, sometimes even induces headaches. This all came about when I started trying to be comfortable with anxiety I believe, forcing negative thoughts away. When you're told you need to accept thoughts as they come, I tend to put full focus on those thoughts, and in a way push them off without ever feeling like they are truly gone, more like I'm just putting more attention on them.
I can ramble forever and try to describe what is wrong but that would be a long post. One more thing is that I cant seem to let go of expectations.

If any of you share similar experiences or can help me I would appreciate it so much. Thank you all!",0
" Anyone ever listen to a tape maybe in the 1980s that started ""Welcome to a new beginning..""? It was a meditation tape spoken by a man meant to help you sleep and mostly discussed self confidence.

He says he can still hear the tape in his head some nights when he really can't sleep. We were talking recently and he explained that he wish he could hear the tape again because the memory is slowly fading and I really want to help him out.

"Have you ever noticed your emotions tend to be pretty consistent or similar day in, day out? 
 I'm really absorbing some concepts so I'll articulate them the best I can.
Recently, after I started meditating I noticed my thoughts were damn near the same each day. Before meditating I would notice this but still fall into them. 
Wake up:oh no, don't wanna go to work. Go to work, make dumb jokes, see cute girls, rationalize not approaching, beat myself up for it, tell myself to stop beating myself up, laugh and decide to become present. 
This is a short comical version obviously. But this theme kept playing out and I realized I was ""stuck"" 

Now just days later, I'm starting to notice this and wow, it's right on target. Anyways, based on the way we see ourselves and our beliefs about our current situation (and how we view ourselves navigating that situation)  that will determine our feeling about that situation, which in turn feeds into our self concept. In essence, creating a loop, or self fulfilling prophecy. 
Our body has a need to feel these feelings, almost like an addiction. Have you ever met people that seek out drama? Even if you're not causing problems with them, they will still find a way to get their fill of problems. Even if it means creating problems to get there. 
In addition, let's say you loved hip hop but then you went to jail. To fulfill your needs you'd probably rap or sing songs to yourself in your head. 
So, consider trying this.. especially if you're generally a depressed, angry, or anxious person. Watch your thoughts and feelings for atleast 3 days. Pay special attention to the times and places your feelings occur, and to recurring themes.

With meditation, you begin to notice this, notice your thoughts, understand what your beliefs are and understand that you choose your own beliefs, you choose your own reactions and ultimately your reality.
It's not an easy process, but I can't think of anything more fulfilling than the ability to choose your own destiny rather than letting your destiny choose you.",0

Ive always been able to do this thing where if I focus hard enough I get this relaxing feeling sent all throughout my body. Its like a subtle energy instantly starts to fill my whole body and especially my legs. I can only do it for 20 seconds tops before it gets too difficult to keep up. I've also noticed that my pupils dilate slightly while it's happening. Can anyone else do this or know anything about what I'm talking about?,0

"So I have been regularly practicing meditation for the past 6 days. I must say that I'm loving it, and I must also include sitting for an hour is not so easy. In the past 6 days I meditated, I only hit the one hour mark, **once**. But I feel like I've already am in the move and would love to share take my meditation journey to the next level. 1 hour of mediation for 100 days. I would love to see if anybody is up to join this journey along with me. 

Thank you :)",0
"A few weeks ago while I was meditating and sometbing I found really interesting happened.

I was doing one of the Headspace meditations where they have you focus on the areas where your chakras are supposed to be located. I was getting into a good rhythm with my breathing and my ears started ringing very loud. From there I followed the meditation and focused on the different areas of my body. When I did this I could feel the pitch of the ringing change with each area I would focus on.

It felt like the ringing was coming from an outside source and I was suddenly able to manipulate where it traveled in my body if I focused hard enough. It kind of felt like I was playing my body like an instrument. And when it hit each area I would hear a different sound. The lower areas having a lower tone and the higher ones having a higher tone.

Has anyone ever experienced this or have any insight on this? I haven't been able to do it since.",0
"Sometimes, I can't feel anything after meditation. No anger, sadness, happiness, excitement, nothing. Its like I'm just rational thought. Even if I try to feel anger, sadness, nothing works.

"I am finally making a concerted effort to foster and secure a routine meditation practice. I've been led enough to know that it can offer profound benefits to body and soul. I think that mine needs a good dose of clorox internally! :-) I am an Army Infantry veteran with a few combat tours as part of a reconnaissance unit. It's a rough way to go, but exciting. So there is that. In my life I have had to deal with a marriage that did not work, nearly dying three times in the space of a 7 months. 

1. July 2016: Car wreck that broke my back and gave me a traumatic brain injury

2. December 21 2016: Jumped from behind by three teens while walking my dog - took me down with a stick to the back of the head, then all 3 took turns literally, specifically stomping on my head. Giving the brain injury that I got in July a refresh, and made worse

3. March 2017: woke up by my daughter turning blue for some reason. My body for some reason decided to try out a case of nearly fatal pneumonia. Woke up in the ICU where I stayed for 5 days. 

Through all of that, my marriage that was under strain, broke. 

Now, I've had some extreme high level brain docs at a Emory U tell me that I have major depressive disorder and extreme PTSD as a result of all of the injuries. They strongly recommended meditation as a means to help control it all and get better. I have 38 years of martial arts experience, so I know the ability to focus is in here somewhere. 

But when it comes to facing up to that anxiety, the prospect of trying to mediate wins because my mind is so good at fighting back. And when I can finally sit and be mindful, all of the energy, rage, anger, confusion, make one helluva anxiety cocktail, that really comes extremely close to overwhelming me and winning back control from being free to disassociate and heal. 

I get the principle of focusing and bringing everything back to the breath. I know that I can acknowledge thoughts, and that I'm supposed to be able to recognize and release. Are there techniques that help one build a foundation to strengthen the internal resolve?

&amp;#x200B;

"I was trying to answer this question while I was experiencing a transition from competitive, career oriented material life to a more balanced, near to nature, life based on meditation and spirituality. 

Couple of months back the realisation that came across was simple. spirituality and it's meaning is timeless and eternal . The definition or an understanding on what it does to you is a everlasting. It does not change with time, context, space or person. Or even based on feelings. 

Compared to ambition or success that has different definition at different times or with different people. Ambition necessarily let's u create a flow rather than be in flow. It creates points of stress because of ever-changing desires and needs. 

So how can it coexist?  Also spirituality in essence is joy in the present moment with no thought of past or future while ambition is all about competition and thoughts of future. 

Would love to hear thoughts!",0

""God is ever-present and unchanging.

Life is the phenomenal universe and perpetually and exponentially growing oneness with God.

God can be compared to the origin, infinity.

And life can be compared to the spiral, which can be seen as a folded wave.

God, oneness, and Truth are complete peace and infinite love, just as the origin is the Heart at which the wave's amplitude approaches zero and its frequency approaches infinity.""

Full text from my site:

“God is ever-present and unchanging.

Life is the phenomenal universe (maya in Indian spiritual philosophy) and perpetually and exponentially growing oneness with God. (Beings who’re more one with God than humans are, such as the Creator, beings to whom worlds are thoughtforms, solar systems like atoms, and humans like cells, goddesses and gods, angels, legendary, celestial, magical, and other supernatural beings, extraterrestrials, and spirits, exist in higher and more majestic dimensions, such as heavens. Beings who're less one with God than humans are include animals, plants, and minerals.)

This can be compared to a logarithmic (equiangular) spiral, a shape commonly found in nature.

God can be compared to the origin, infinity.

(The origin is the center point that the spiral converges towards,

ϴ → ∞ using the polar equation r = aeb(-ϴ))

And life can be compared to the spiral, which can be seen as a folded wave.

God, oneness, and Truth are complete peace and infinite love, just as the origin is the Heart at which the wave's amplitude approaches zero and its frequency approaches infinity.

(We perpetually and exponentially grow towards Godliness, oneness, and our true Self and Heart, becoming nobler \[dedicated to universal, world, and inner peace\] \[complete peace, zero amplitude\], and stronger \[infinite love, infinity frequency\], like a logarithmic spiral perpetually and exponentially approaching its origin.)”

"So, over the weekend I read a few chapters from the very popular Eckhart Tolle book, The Power of Now, which I saw being recommended here a lot. Although I was moved by the teachings, and the idea that we only ever have the present moment, I found myself a bit distraught by the heavy spiritual nature and ""purpose of awakening"". Specifically, completely letting go of the past and the future and only thinking about the future when you want to plan something. I think my ego has been hurt so much by that and I don't feel very well lol. 

I do understand that constant preoccupation with the past or the future can lead to a lot of built up anxiety in one's life, but completely letting them go seems a bit extreme to me, and very watered down- Buddhist in nature.

Life is an art. And creating the life you want to live is also an art. We live in a world whose rules are defined by capitalism, and recognizing that is just being realistic. At the same time we also live in a world where opportunities to be who you want to be are more than ever, both in terms of personal expression and career wise.

So why would you want to let go of that, and let go of your dreams for the future, as long as they are realistic? And who defines what realistic is anyways? I believe you should manifest the life that you want to live, even if that includes material things. Material things are part of the human desire.

I guess what I try to take away from this book was to appreciate the life you have right now more. As well as trusting the process of your vision. Because to truly manifest what you want in life, without getting lost in anxiety, you first need to appreciate the present life that you do have, otherwise you're going to be stuck in a cycle of not ever feeling satisfied, and chasing unattainable highs.

So, to me that means appreciating the life I live right now and finding joy and gratitude in it, because there's a lot of both to be found. And basking in it. And using that as momentum to achieve my goals. And getting up every morning and fighting for my dreams. And realizing that even my short term goals right now, are in essence my big goals. But I'm also realistic about the fact that although I do find joy and immense gratitude in being middle class, I would be much happier being rich. (Just one example)

Happiness is a journey. And I believe that designing the life you want to live is true happiness. And ego is essential in that.

What do you guys think? Did I misunderstand the book or take it too pragmatically? Am I just too young and not ready to accept true awakening? Would I have gotten more resolution had I finished it?",0

"Hi guys

For the last 2 years I have explored the topic of Life After Death and what happens to our loved ones after they die. Losing a loved one 5 years ago led me to ask questions and seek answers outside of the rational everyday approach to life.   Beyond the Veil is a documentary I've been working on that is the culmination of this research, where I’ve had the chance to meet, interview and work with some of the most incredible teachers in the field. Their work has opened my eyes to a reality I could have never even dreamed of and one which I want to share with you all.

Beyond The Veil is a feature documentary that explores life after death. Told through the eyes of those born with the gift of communicating with the spirit world, this film shines a light on the evidence and personal accounts of what really happens in the afterlife.  Backed by the latest research on consciousness, Beyond the Veil is the first of its kind film that aims to bridge the gap between the psychic and scientific world and to provide hope and proof of the afterlife.    

Now, with 80% of the filming done, I need everyone’s support to help me see this vision come to completion and tell a story that deserves to be told and most importantly help those who are grieving. For the next month I am launching a fundraising campaign to help me fund the remaining funds in order to complete this story and send it out into the world.  I would hugely appreciate any support you can give me by clicking on the link below and sharing it on your SM.

"Hey everyone,
I have been practicing meditation very on and off for the past year or two and haven’t really made much progress. Recently, I started trying to sit again and it was going well for the first week or so. 
After the first week or so, after I meditated, I would just have a constant stream of thoughts rush through my head the rest of the day. I felt almost no control over them at all and it got to the point where it adversely affected my athletic performance. This has been a major contributor as to why I keep stopping and starting my practice and becomes more and more frustrating as time goes on. 
Has anyone experienced this problem before? If so, what are some potential steps to ameliorate the situation? Should I continue sitting and just ride through the difficulty or should I consider stopping for good? I almost feel as if I am repressing my thoughts during the meditation and they come out nonstop throughout the course of the day. Thanks for reading and for any help/advice at all!",0

"I've always loved the four noble truths of Buddhism because they're succinct, clear, and simple.

1. Existence is full of stress.

2. Stress is caused by urgency (tanha).

3. The relinquishment of urgency is the end of stress.

4. To relinquish urgency, follow this 8 step program! (The 8-fold path)

Tanha is often translated as ""desire,"" which makes people think they have to stop wanting things in order to relax or be happy. I think this is a mistake. It's also translated as ""craving,"" ""thirst,"" ""longing,"" ""greed"" or any other number of words, but these don't capture what tanha is as a concept.

The origin of suffering is not wanting things to be a certain way, or the desire to have something, it's the urgency behind a thought that causes strain. It's the difference between seeing a slice of cake after you're eaten a meal, and seeing one after you haven't eaten all day. It's the *right now* in the phrase, ""I want it *right now!*""

So, when I sit to meditate, I don't attempt to dissuade myself from wanting things. I know that my intentions are to make myself feel better, to relax, etc. and I don't have to stop wanting that. Instead, I attempt to let go of any sense of *urgency* behind my thoughts. You can do this rather simply with self talk. If you're worried about your bank account you can say, ""I don't have to check that right now, I can leave it till later."" If you're upset about a conversation you had earlier, you can say, ""I don't have to figure this out now, it can wait."" 

When you meditate, you are teaching yourself to let go of any sense of imperative behind your thoughts. ""Letting go"" doesn't mean trying to forget or push things away, because that, itself, is urgency. This is how any meditation practice can backfire and your method turns into a stressors itself. Instead, you let go by realizing you don't have to fix anything *right now*. You procrastinate your thoughts until all urgency fades, and you don't have any feelings pushing at you one way or another.

Then, practice that in daily life until you never feel a sense of urgency again.",0
"I had been meditating with positive affirmations for the past month but just over the last week I had decided to stop using them and just meditate (self guided) with some 432 hz calming music. Yesterday I had tried out a meditation method known as moon gazing and after that, everything seemed a little different

Anyways, today I mediated (self guided) for 15 minutes but this meditation stood out. My hands felt electric as if generating energy and the middle of my forehead started to tingle. 

After I finished meditation, everything seemed to appear brighter color wise. The tingling sensation is still active currently, but the most different thing I noticed is that everything (even morning coffee) began to taste very different almost a little more pure (I felt like I could taste each individual coffee bean). Then, In the shower today I was able to just appreciate the sound of the water hitting my skin and didn’t even have a single thought enter my brain really.

"This is just something I noticed, and I am writing it here as much for myself to remember as for others if they have a similar experience.  I started a mindfulness based stress reduction course a few weeks ago.  I have meditated for years but had a hiccup in recent years(you can read my post history if you really want to know). Hoping the course would help me with some mild anxiety/depression and ptsd from trauma, it was recommended by my therapist. 

This week I noticed I was much more anxious than usual.  No real reason, maybe a few more triggers than usual at work and a stressful weekend preventing me from having much downtime.  I seemed pretty run down by Thursday and noticed my anxiety was gone and replaced with a pretty strong feeling of not wanting to do anything.  Work or play.  

Seems like I can get stuck in fight or flight mode, like my sympathetic nervous system won’t shutdown when I don’t get a break somewhere.  The funny thing is I always hated the depressed feeling but it actually served a purpose.  I went to sleep earlier, I didn’t fight the feeling, so I got a few extra hours since my wife was out of town.  Seems like it resolved itself.  I try so hard to want to do something when I feel depressed.  It never occurred to me it is a natural defense to get me to do some non doing.  Force me to get back into neutral when I have been going to hard for a few days.  

Dont get me wrong, I was still watching a lot of negative cognitive distortions and working techniques I had learned in the course to reduce stress.  Doesn’t mean I think leaving someone alone and depressed is safe or a good idea.  But from a place of non judging and openness, it seemed to help.

"When living and working in four countries, I realized, that everywhere people create their own unique “I” and “me” about who they think they are. What differs is how they express it. But no matter how it always creates problems.

In Germany, people tend to be self-centered and create problems where there are none. In Japan, self-expression is very low, which suppresses the sharing of feelings and leads to frustrations. On the contrary, in the US where self-expression is very high, I often sensed that people are playing a role, leading to superficial relationships. In Mexico, the group is valued higher than the individual. I noticed that people were pleasing each other's egos instead of speaking the (unpleasant) truth, which can take a relationship to a deeper and more fulfilling level.

These observations are of course always only parts of the truth.

"Hi, got back into meditation again recently (a week ago) and this time thinking of making it a habit and eventually a lifestyle.   


I dont know much about meditation (what different ways to do it) so for now I am just focusing on breath, which I kinda struggle to focus on anyway and it doesn't make me feel as peace as the next thing I do.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes me feel as peace (or feel good) is when I just let my thoughts wonder, and let them wonder and eventually the thought kinda shut down and I am focusing on nothing (idk, like im just there, or maybe im focusing on my head, its weird to explain) and then I start to see weak patterns (im not a visual thinker at all, for the longest time I have aphantasia), and i feel like im very light headed, and I feel like I am going deeper and deeper into state, and then (the limit of my meditation as of now) I start visualisation (again very weak) which gets me anxious or takes me by surprise and my heart starts racing and I get out of that deep state. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have very weak visualisation skills (I use to think I have aphantasia), and I was thinking that maybe my weak visualisation skills is due to trauma from childhood, or just genetics, or combination. And I had fear of being schizophrenia due to bad weed experience, and so now when I start experiencing visualization, my heart start racing a lot and I start getting anxious and it brings me out of that flow state (i have to say the visualization part happens normally when I am trying to meditate to sleep, but has maybe happened once recently).

"Hey! I'm a college student from Mumbai, India and I'm doing research on how mindfulness meditation can help manage stress after regular practice. Since I do not know many people who meditate regularly I thought this subreddit would be the best place to ask for help. The rationale for this research is to evaluate whether mindfulness meditation helps manage perceived stress in individuals and if it does then to promote the practice to people who are struggling with stress. 

From my own personal experience, mindfulness meditation has helped me change the way I perceive stress and my own personal identity and I hope to help other people who are in need to change how they perceive stress.

Research question - A comparative study of young and middle-aged adults on how they perceive stress before and after mindfulness meditation. 

The first part of the questionnaire is the perceived stress scale by Sheldon Cohen, which you will have to answer twice, the first time in retrospect of the time before you used to meditate and how you perceived stress back then and then the second time by answering how you perceive stress now after regular practice of mindfulness meditation. 

The second part of the questionnaire is about your practice of mindfulness meditation.

If you guys respond and I can do my research then I will post my findings along with my research paper soon so that the people who take part in the research can read what they helped create.

You can ask any questions related to my research in the comments and if you want I can also share a note which explains how I plan to carry out my research. Thank you!

Maybe I’m just settling into a routine, but theoretically I still have many things I’d like to learn, including changing careers and various hobbies.

I have seen a therapist several times, she said there is nothing wrong with me except my negative thinking. I know I’m not suicidal and I have cried about change several times. I work out 6 x a week, work at my family restaurant, meditate every day now and eat healthy. I haven’t been sleeping properly, 5-6 hours a night and I cold turkey my anxiety meds last week – they are really low dosage. 

I don’t just don’t know why I’m not getting better when I’m trying so hard. Is it because I’m looking so hard to change and get better?",0
I don’t have the patience for meditation. I keep trying but I’m not seeing any progress. My mind feels like it’s always racing and the moment I try to bring it back my mind gets bored and runs of again. Does anyone have tips or advice or is this just not for me?,0
"I have a very visual brain so i can remember my life events in great detail starting from kindergarten lol. You might think that sounds nice, being able to relive your memories but its absolute hell. During the day I might see something that reminds me of this event that reminds me of that event and so on...

Meditation wise I just observe what image comes to my brain and then i ""stare"" at that image until it fades. It always fades though and i might be looking blankly at the mental image for 3min. After a While my mind is in a complete meditative state",0

"Hi guys! 

I tried to look online if anyone else have had a similar experience as me, but it was very difficult to find anything that was related to it, so here I am.. A couple of days ago I felt like I managed to get a bit deeper into a meditative mind (been meditating for 2 months), but then suddenly I saw a nose! Like no joke, a huge nose just randomly appeared! It was carved out by the «colorful» pattern you sometimes see when closing your eyes.. like it’s all dark/black with some color spots appearing here and there... but the color spots this time turned into a nose for like 4-5 seconds. Idk what is going on, if it means something or not. It was just so random, and I was wondering if anyone else have expereineced something similar? Seeing an object or something else?",0

"About a year ago I began an experiment with my yoga nidra practice. Instead of following a traditional guided meditation, I threw on Pink Floyd's Dark of the Moon. I repeated my sankalpa three times during the opening drum beat and laid perfectly still for the album's duration, mediating on the music, and repeated my sankalpa again at the end. When I opened my eyes 42 minutes and 32 seconds later, my vision was vibrating and my body radiated that familiar nidra glow. Since then I've meditated to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Derek and the Dominos, harder albums by The Stooges and Hüsker Dü, and symphonies by Beethoven, Mozart, Philip Glass and others. I prefer full-length records, ideally concept albums -- Sgt. Pepper in particular is a blast. Pink Floyd is my go-to -- their space rock is perfect for the practice. 

I'm not sure if it provides the same alleged benefits of traditional yoga nidra, such as the supposed 15 minutes equivalent to an hour of sleep. I've discussed the matter with mediation teachers, who voiced thorough skepticism about the relaxation available from a rockin beat and screaming guitars. But I find it awesome. 

Thoughts? Has anybody else tried this?",0

"This has happened to me a few times in the past week or two. I’ve had a great idea for a project (I’m an artist) or solution to a problem, but then it evaporates on me as if it were waking up from a dream and I’m only left with the feeling of forgetting something. I don’t want to stop the meditation to write it down or focus on the idea too much so that I’ll be more likely to remember it. Kinda seems like I’m stuck with just hoping it’ll stick.

"Hello friend, I’ve been postponing teaching myself how to meditate and incorporating it into my life for quite some time, and I believe it’s time for me to start.

"  

Several years ago I had established a consistent daily practice for 8 months based on Mindfulness in Plain English. Sit, watch the breath, bring my attention back when it wanders. 

Fast forward to a few months ago and I wanted to get back into practice and Sam Harris' style of teaching and meditation knowledge really resonated with me. I have been struggling to really connect with his practice and it approaches it from a perspective that I feel like I'm ""not getting"" or ""doing right"". Sit, try to locate the center or the thing called I, and turn attention on itself. He cuts right to the point of showing you how to see the self as illusion but I feel like I'm not doing it correctly. I really love the method he teaches but I'm just conflicted now. 

I want to just go back to Minduflness in plain english where I feel like I am doing it right but then I feel guilty and a bit stupid for ""giving up"" on what Sam is teaching.

I'm not sure what to do in this situation. ",0
"this last year my whole life has felt fairly boring. It started when i got depressed at the start of last college year, which i was able to deal with using meditation. 
However, i think this has definitely had a negative effect on me overall. 
I went from being a big part of a large group of friends, who i was very close with, to only being close with one person in the group and losing all ability to connect with my other friends in the group. I feel as if i have lost my witty, excitable side that i would show when around these people.
I know people say that meditation can cause a person to change, however it feels as if it has created a sense of calm in my self where i am no longer feeling emotions good or bad as much as i used to.
I was using visualisation techniques designed to ‘let go of stress’ which did create a sense of calm in me but at the cost of feeling other emotions, good or bad. 
I have been doing living kindness meditation and mindfulness recently which is helping me to realise emotions when they appear more and is creating more positive emotions in me, but it often feels theres something blocking me fully feeling certain things, such as joy and happiness which i do often feel but never in a way that makes me want to connect with others and have a laugh with them like i used to. 
Is this because i repressed my depressed and anxious feelings last year to cope with depression, which is stopping me fully feeling a whole range of emotions ? 
Things have been getting better recently now that i’m becoming more aware of how i’m feeling, but i feel there are many places where i’m being held back by not feeling certain things, e.g when socialising which has caused me to drift from many very good friends this year.
anyone have any advice on how to fully feel things again ?",0

"I've been meditating almost daily for a couple of year now. I sold, obviously. Have been relying on Headspace for quite some time, as well as some other non-guided apps and several books. 

I'm finding myself in a place where I've got an opportunity to do whatever I can I life. By that I mean that I'm at a corner in life, where I can choose a brand new path for me and for the world. My life until then felt it was on autopilot, and I feel the need to find a profound reason to act.

What type of meditation exercises could I do the help these interrogations? Headspace has one (in the Appreciation pack) taht makes you ask yourself questions, but I'm unsure of how I could phrase those questions. Any ideas, either of questions or exercises?

"Specifically, this one https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4EaMJOo1jks&amp;t=2s

I've been a smoker, a pack a day, for 20 years.  But after I closed my eyes and listened to this, it was like turning off a switch.  It's crazy.  I still get urges to smoke but I feel like I am in control of them now, instead of the other way around - I simply ignore them.  I haven't smoked in 8 days.  Has anybody else quit smoking with meditation?",0
"Probably a year back I stopped a consistent half year meditation streak. I can remember how amazing it felt to carry that sense of calmness, stillness and the wider view on thing with me. As of now, I really want to get back into this consistent practice, but it feels to hard. I know that if I continue, I'll get back to that state where it feels like total bliss, but for now it feels to much of a chore or a full 20 minutes of wandering in distractions.

Exams will start for me now, which means I have full days of studying at home. I'll start every morning and afternoon session of studying with 15 minutes of meditation and in between pomodoro's of 25 minutes, I'll do 10 minutes of meditation. This should give me a head start.

I know I should not resist practice or difficulties within the practice and that this is a great opportunity for growth, but I just wanted to get this off my shoulders an perhaps people can share their insights with each other about this initial bump on the road.

There are flowers on the other side of the hill and it will take Right Practice and Right Diligence to get over the top. Though it's not a big top, one can not see what's on the other side, on needs to have faith to get there.",0
"I guess it was just wild to me idk but I never experienced it before. I kinda forgot about my whole body beneath me and all that existed was my mind and I was in a place where I was completely not judging my thoughts (something I struggle with during meditation and daily life). I almost started to panic a little because it felt like leaving the real world behind, but I just reminded myself that I could open my eyes at anytime. But by far the most interesting part was that behind my eyelids, it was like I was watching a movie. Different colored streaks and shapes of light (idk why but the outline of a baby kept showing up). And lastly, this blue ball of glowing light kept showing up, rushing into my field of vision, staying for just a moment, and then dissipating about 5-10 times over again until the bell was rung to end the meditation. I’ve gotten to places of extreme relaxation with meditation before but never like this and I guess I don’t know what it means. I’ve meditated off and on for a few years now, but recently I’ve been on a 30 days of meditation challenge so I’m hoping for more interesting experiences.",0

"can you people just breathe and chill out? why so many questions? meditation is just getting in touch with yourself, so do whatever helps. music, art, exercise, sitting and breathing... why do you over complicate everything?",0
"I use to strive for happiness all the time but when you're needy about something it usually won't come until you don't want it anymore.  That's just the paradoxical nature of the universe, like when you get in a relationship and now people want to be interested in you for some reason.   Lots of people including me  get disappointed in yourself for not being happy, which is counter productive.  To make a lot more progress in your ability to concentrate, your meditation practice, and over all well-being, a much better goal to strive towards is to be aware all the time.  Being aware and staying in the moment go hand in hand.  The body's natural state is feeling good so we get in our ways most of the time. By staying aware you'll be calm and focused and in the parasympathetic state which will lead to you feeling good, no forcing it needed :)

**Tips for staying aware:**

\-Where ever you are is the most important thing in your life. We tend to be goal oriented and lose focus on the journey.  Stay aware of the path you take to get to your goal.

\-Stay aware of your feet, your feet are a great anchor to the present because it grounds you and there's always sensations there to focus on

\-Learn how to breath properly. Watching the breath is great for your health and focus. Try to breath as quietly, deeply and slowly as you can. The less you breath the better and more open your blood vessels will be so **don't over breath.**  (Unless you're exercising of course)  Over breathing/hard breathing leads to constricted blood vessels and anxiety.

\-Observe the hypnotizing nature of thoughts. When a thought pops up try and stay aware, even if you can't and you get pulled away just notice what happened and come back to the moment. Notice how your attention was snatched from you and learn from it. This will really help you get to know yourself also.

\-**Don't judge the moment,** this is what I struggle with the most, but if you can stay aware of the moment non judgmentally and observe your ego labeling things as boring or exciting you'll make great progress in loosening the ego's grip.

\-Your ego's not a bad thing as long as you're using it and it's not using you.

\-Notice all things you're aware of right now. You're awareness is the space that holds all of your senses/thoughts/feelings try and be grounded in this space.

\-Notice when you go unconscious, did you grab that glass of water with out thinking? Did you drive to work on autopilot? Did you actually say those words or did they just spill out of your mouth with no awareness?  Notice when you go unconscious and try to bring consciousness to everything you do.",0
"Pain is inevitable. Suffering is an optional extra that we experience when we cling to things and try to deny the notion that nothing is permanent.

You don't have to suffer if you can learn to properly live in the moment, and feel everything you need to feel as it comes. Don't push negative things away. Don't try to hold onto anything positive for dear life as if you depend on it. You can't control anything. Just don't resist. let it all unfold before you.

It's quite simple, really. But that doesn't mean it's easy!

Remember that through meditation, you're not trying to get yourself to permanently be in a happy and euphoric mindset or whatever. Remove the notions that it's ""bad"" to feel depressed or any other emotions we call negative. They are just as important as positive ones. Don't be upset just because you're still miserable after meditating a whole bunch. That's missing the point. It's more about becoming comfortable with your misery. Befriend your misery. Go deeper into it.",0

"Hi, I'm new here. I've recently shifted gears with my meditation practice and have become a bit of an enthusiast about buddhist psychology and philosophy in general.

I would like to do a retreat some day but I'm a little bit reluctant. Long story short, I have pretty unstable sense of self, possibly even a full-blown personality disorder, although I've never been diagnosed. I have a lot of Narcissistic and Borderline traits, more than I would like, but I've done a LOT of work and therapy and I've reached a point where I can say I have more emotional intelligence and self-awareness than half the people I meet. It's been a long road, and I haven't found what I'm looking for. Enter: meditation.

The Insight practice + Metta I have been doing has given me some surprisingly good results and I feel I've found something really worth perusing here. I'm understating it actually, I'm actually really excited about it. The more I read about it the more I want to know. The spiritual aspect of it, the opening of the heart, the increase of compassion for your fellow human-being, and of course 'the end of suffering' through enlightenment (but let's not get carried away, I don't expect to become enlightened any time soon, just a taste would be nice).

But something I read recently scared me: 'One has to be somebody before becoming nobody"". Which I interpret as 'You have have a self in order to attain 'non-self'. Makes a lot of sense doesn't it? 

Does anyone have some thoughts on this? Or even better: do people with a similar condition have some experience and advise to share with me? Success stories or work-arounds are particularly welcome :) I would really, really like to carry on doing this (at a slow and steady pace).

Thanks a lot. Loving-kindness to you all :-)",0

"Two years ago I [25/M] had severe crippling anxiety, anxiety attacks almost every day and couldn’t last a day without feeling or thinking about my anxiety. I started meditating a few months ago, nothing serious or consistent. But it helped along with working out, losing weight and seeing a therapist about my OCD thoughts and fear of having suicidal thoughts which were caused by my OCD and anxiety which was just a loop. 

Present moment, I have been following a strict workout program which I created since I have been working out for years before my anxiety. I’m currently on week 3 and have followed it to the dot, 6 days a week. I have been meditating every single day but not at a specific time and not a specific form. I have been on Insight Timer listening to a few guided meditations here and there and it’s been 11 consecutive days. I have listened to love and kindness meditation and teared up almost every time. I have been reading two self-help books here and there – Make Peace With Your Mind &amp; Can’t Hurt Me. My sleep schedule is still a mess because I’m trying to balance my last year of university and running a family owned restaurant with my dad so I’m trying my best.

Meditation has definitely helped me, but it’s also kind of overwhelming me in a sense. I’ve meditated some days where I completely lose track of time and 20 mins turns into 5 mins because I’m paying attention to my mind. I’ve done yoga nidra where I got completely lost into the sensation of every tissue. Some days my meditations aren’t working out, I’m either too sleepy to stay present or my back is sore from working out. 

I’m always trying to find the “best” guided meditation to “fix” me, but in hindsight I already know that I’m fixed. I saw my therapist last Monday and she couldn’t believe the steps I have taken on my own to become better. I’m overthinking whether “meditating” is actually working and if I’ll ever be “better”. But I already know that I’m better. When I’m able to stay present I feel peace and calmness. When I allow my mind to think it’s wondering why am I like this, is something even wrong with me, why can’t I just be me. But I then realize that my past is what made me, it is the reason why I’m like this. I didn’t have the greatest childhood – mentally. Lots of dysfunctional problems within my household which I tried to ignore by being a kid and just going out and being active but I was aware of it. Then I turned into a shut in, I spent maybe over 10+ years on the internet, avoiding actual responsibilities as school and sleeping. I did exercises and play sports but my mind was always excited to go home. But I know that I’m capable of great things when my mind is set. My entire highschool year I was getting 60s until I got to my last year and said enough is enough. Changed myself completely, mentally and physically I was at my best. Got accepted into university and from there it all fell off again and that’s how I’m here. 

I’m aware that I can do what I put my mind to. But I’m too stuck in my comfort zone. I don’t suffer from social anxiety anymore, I do have generalized anxiety but I push through it no matter what physically or chemical sensations I feel throughout my body. I’m aware it’s just anxiety. 

But now I’m confused about life. I’m not hopeless or anything. I’m actually hopeful and want to do great things. I need to work on the following things to truly feel great because they’re haunting me:

• How do I overcome my fears. 

• How do I stop feeling anxious because I’m worrying about fear. 

• How do I stop looking for my purpose in life or thinking about it constantly when I already know what I want – a great physique for my health, a well paying job so I never have to feel like I’m less, a loving family with my girlfriend.

• How do I let go of all the years I have been avoiding my anxiety and well-being and the two years where my anxiety was destroying my life

• How do I stop overthinking everything and being scared I’ll never get better 

• How do I stay present all the time and control my emotional reaction to avoid the anxious loop of OCD thoughts 

I’m fully aware that anxiety is built in us to survive as humans and that everyone has anxiety. But it’s the emotional reaction to those thoughts that can make or break you. I know that change is possible due to neuroscience and meditation studies showing that we aren’t a “fixed” mind we are a programmed mind – which is capable of being modified (change in our wifed mind). 

*Are these thoughts normal when starting to focus seriously on meditation?* I have started 30 day journey to rebirth by on Insight Timer so hopefully that will help. I’m gonna continue to work on myself through journaling, exercising, gonna start running and sleeping before midnight as well.

"So I had been hearing about all the benefits of meditation and provided I've just started my anxiety and depression meds and I'm seeing a therapist, I thought this was the best moment to try it.

My meds make me quite groggy, I'll admit, and at least in one occasion, my head has fallen back, as if I were to fall asleep, but I didn't. I have heard the music and the noises around me beyond the headphones the whole time.
When the timer went off I was quite surprised because it felt like time had flown by. I thought the general sensation was the opposite! In the end, I was feeling relaxed and still groggy, I would've put myself into bed immediately, but it was the early morning.

Have I done this okay, or have I just been in a asleep/awake state for the whole time?",0
"I know meditation improves our ability to focus on things. But i just want to know if it helps 100% against procrastination in the short term. I often find myself being on ""default"" mode? which is like, endlessly replaying games and youtube videos I've already played and seen and spend time there and can't seem to start working. 

Can meditation make it easier to start studying if I do it right before I start my study sessions? Or does it only help fix the problem of ""being in default mode"" and the problem of ""being passive and reacting to things""? Do I only need to meditate in mornings/night/the day when I study, or does meditating right before studying and during study breaks help more?",0
"I’m sorry, but I scrolled through this sub and it’s really, really strange.

I know nothing about meditation. I mean, I’ve sat and focused on my breathing and tried to focus on my body and what it’s saying. I never feel like I’ve been good at that even. I don’t like sitting still for long periods of time.

So... how do I do it? Why is it important? I know there are scientific evidences and studies showing this is beneficial, but how has it helped you?",0
"I have been meditating for over a month almost every night. I have had periods where I didn't know what I was doing. But just recently I think I started to see the point. I started observing how my thoughts come and go, and what those thoughts really mean. I noticed how my negative thoughts usually have dire predictions. The moment I acknowledge the thought in it's entirety, I felt a sense of calm.

I share more details here about what my meditation process looks like and the motivation behind why we need to observe thoughts. https://medium.com/p/c5117041aa46.",0

"Hello guys,

recently I have been doing a new form of meditation that involves pronic breathing and a ""subconscious mind"" technique that I wanted to share. First, let me explain pronic breathing.

* Breathe in for 6 counts
* wait 3 counts
* Breathe out for 6 counts making an ""sssssssss"" sound
* wait 3 counts
* Breathe normally 2 times
* Repeat

Let me explain the process.

1. First, do normal get in state by meditating normally by bringing awareness to your breath &amp; body for a few minutes.
2. Second, bring your awareness to the back end of your spine and do 3 cycles of pronic breathing to establish a deep connection with your body and get out of your head.
3. Third, imagine roots coming out the soles of your feet, deep into the ground. And do 3 cycles of pronic breathing. This time, visualize the air coming up from the roots into the back of your spine as you breathe in, and out of the roots as you breathe out. This will get you grounded and make you feel safe enough to access your subconscious better. It works cause your mind can't differentiate between imagination and reality at that moment.
4. This is the important part. Start noticing sensations in your chest and stomach area. That's where repressed emotions hide. You might feel a tightness or you might start shaking. Shaking is good as it releases tension. Breathe into those sensations. Think ""When was the last time I felt this sensation?"", ""When was the first time I felt this sensation?"". Get to the core. It won't be easy at first
5. After feeling the sensations for a bit, however much you like, do 3 cycles of pronic breathing again. Imagine the sensation coming up as you breathe in. As you breathe out imagine the sensation leaving your body.
6. Sit and feel the relief for a bit

&amp;#x200B;

Try it out for a while, it works really well! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't been meditating for a while at least, but it's definitely something to try if you've already been meditating for some time.

Cheers!",0
"thanks guys already for this great subreddit, I always find very inspiring posts here. Now I got an issue since about a month. 

I've been practicing meditation for around 1 year more or less consistently ca. 10 to 20 minutes each day, sometimes 50.  Sometimes guided, sometimes only with a timer. 

I noticed something weird. The longer I don't practice meditation the more I only think and 'obsess' about it.  I kind of slipped out of my routine during my travels and since I'm back I haven't been meditating. I  get all these thoughts about meditation and they revolve around 'hm meditation is so good for you' 'yees you really felt better and were able to go through emotions' 'so interesting that meditation does that to you etc.'. 

I wondered, is that my ego trying to keep me away from actually doing meditation? I noticed it in a different area. If I tell someone ""I'm gonna work on my essay today"" I'm less likely to work on it, because the positive response of saying it out loud means in my brain apparently that I already did it. Which is not true.

Am I procrastinating meditation? Anyone had that as well?",0

"So, there's this thing that happens with me, I'll get super stressed about something and on occasion I will reach the threshold of what my mind can handle and then a second later all the stress lets go and I feel calm, but then my mind goes a bit funny in the process. I think it's some sort of pre-psychosis thing. It usually heals within a day or two and then I'm fine, but I'm wondering if anybody has a similar experience and have you tried meditating and exploring the sensations of this particular state (the state being painlessness, aloofness, loss of function, occasional extreme frustration/anger) ? I ask because my usual response to this happening is to block it all out and ignore it while it's there and just try to lay low until I return to normal. I've started meditating regularly however, and I want to explore this with meditation but I am afraid that it might aggravate the symptoms, so I'm just wondering if anybody has tried this before and what were the results?

"When you can see that thought is only an expression of what is being experienced-you begin to see that thought is not the controller of impulses and movements in your body and brain. This suddenly transforms your whole experiencing structure. Now there is no escape from what is being experienced. Thought is not able to coin any relief, consolation as an escape from what is being experienced. You enter into a new dimension.

Pick a pen. A whole set of physiological and neurological movements are involved. Now the thinking – I have picked the pen – is expression through words.  
 Thinking arises to explain. This is the limit of thinking.  
 The actual movements – physiological and neurological happen.  
 Put your hand in cold water. There is feeling in the body and brain. Now thought can express this feeling, it is not this feeling.

 The implication of this is like this.  
 When the above fact is noticed, any expression like of sadness, confusion, stress, anger and so on – there is no one questioning the feeling of sadness, confusion and so on. Thought is unable to gloss over them. Energy remains concentrated.

‘I do not want to be angry’; ‘I want to be free from fear’; ‘I want to be happy’; and so on, the words create an alienation as if there is a separate entity to reject or retain.",0

"Hey fellow 'taters, I've immersed myself significantly the more rational, westernized side of meditation for quite some time now, with the likes of Kabat-Zinn, Sam Harris, and Shinzen Young.

I'm interested to delve more into the more mystical, esoteric side of meditation. Nothing too far gone or religious, but something that brushes with ideas like ""we are all one"", and ""we are the universe experiencing itself objectively"". Something in between arcane yogic texts and scientific mindfulness speak. I am a skeptic when it comes down to it, but I really do enjoy the food for thought. Shinzen Young touches on some ideas more like this in The Science of Enlightenment, and I want to explore further. Any recommendations? Preferably something I could find on audible.

"I have been meditating on and off for the last year and a half, however in the last two months I’ve been consistently doing it every day. With the breath, is there a particular way how to inhale and exhale the most effective? Like are you supposed to let the air fill down to your stomach and then back up - I am only saying this because of the fact how I thought I was doing the correct way and getting results, however my cousin (who is a black belt in Jiu Jitsu and has been meditating since he started his martial art) has told me a different technique.

" The only real intoxicant, which lasts for lifetimes, is bliss. Nothing is more wonderful than the cocktails your bio-chemical, bio-electric endorphins released by the pineal, pituitary and other glands you were born with. No fermented beverage can match the wonderful power of life than bliss. When you can consciously awaken bliss, what need is there for temporary intoxicants?

The source of these powerful endorphins is the electro-magnetic energy your body is coming into contact with through the subtle physical body, the subtle emotional body, the fiery mental body and higher consciousness. If these bliss is lacking, the gateways must be purified first, allowing for the path to bliss to increase. It's a result of purifying negative karma, misconduct, negative habits of mind, diet and other ways which are unwholesome, which need reorientation.

I am interested in knowing about the following experience.

Last night meditating, at one point I felt how my body hairs bristled and were static, and at the same time I felt how my bed vibrated or felt that someone was hitting the bed mattress from below.

I was absolutely aware. When the first blow occurred, I opened my eyes because it was so brutal ... I closed my eyes again and the same.

I haven't found anything related even on the web.

I thought that it could be an astral projection but, I have already had projections and this has not happened, rather it is a much more brutal and constant vibration (astral projection)

So my main question is how can I do all of these if you do not think? Don’t you have to think to understand, learn, and gain something? I really want to learn about meditation, mindfulness, and enlightenment but do not know where to start.

"My lovely friends, I think it works. I am 23, most of my adult life I am very shallow emotionally. I dont have things like attachment to people, empathy, love, guilt, sensitivity and many other normal emotional feelings. I am dead emotionally, I can even watch executions without any sensitivity.

When I was meditating, I was imaging myself as a kid, and trying to remind what I was feeling. I was imaging my love to people, being very happy and attached to them. During the meditation, I felt like a kid once again, I felt love, attachment and every human emotion.

I felt like I wanted to hug someone, and take care of someone. I felt like a normal human being. I know what normal people can feel now.

"As the title says; I've been meditation for almost 4 months. I decided to meditation for personal reasons.

At the start I meditated for 5 minutes, even less. Now I last between 25-30 minutes, sometimes I meditate twice a day, but most of the time I  do it just once. I think it's enough.

My method is quite simple for anyone interested:

- Half lotus (I put a pillow in my back because back issuess).
- I put my headphones and I play the Om mantra (Om mantra @ 432 hz for anyone interested).
- I just pay attention to the mantra. I bring my mind back to my meditation if its wandering.

I'm planing to try Sodarshan Chakra Kriya at some point.

Now here are some results I've had so far:

- As I said: I meditate more and more as time pass by. I feel that I could meditate for one hour in a few months (i do it everyday).

- Itching: I think this is a common issue for almost everyone. I've read threads on this sub asking for advice and how to get over it. This is what happened to me:

I had terrible itching (I still have), the itching in my ears were a pain in the ass to deal with, I had to stop my meditation because the itching was unbearable. Anyways, at some point I said 'fuck it, ill meditate for 5 mins if necessary. better than nothing.' I was frustrated and I thought I would never meditate more than 10 mins or so. 

However, out of the blue, a couple of months ago (maybe august?) I could tolerate the itch.  I can't explain, but now the itch doesn't bother me. At all. Even if it is intense. Probably my will became stronger?. I don't know, however this is a great progress. 

- I can focus more easily. I still have a very active mind, but because I choose to, but  now i can control it whenever I want.
 
I remember that my mind was a mess in the mornings, it wouldn't shut up, but now is quite different.

- This is where I need help and know why it happened:

Last sunday I started to meditate in the afternoon; at some point of my meditation I began to see images, not abstract images or random stuff but it was more like places I know in real life, i know they exist  because those images were from my city. Does it make sense?.

It just happened me once, but it was the weirdest experience i've had so far. I mean, I  sometimes I see some lights, but I never experienced something  like that. It happned me once, but never again. Has anyone else experienced something like that?.

Thanks for reading this and I hope it makes sense since english ain't my first language.

"I have been trying to control the ability to manifest for something but it does not work when I want it to work. I can only manifest something only when I am really nervous, panicking or in difficult situation. Like for example when I am really nervous because I have a problem then I use my inner brain to want something and the problem fixes, most of the times it's instantly. For example, the other day I was looking for something really important that I lost and needed, I could not find it so I gave up and I was really nervous and panicking then suddenly I would find it. One day a tree fell on my face, I was really panicking and my power to manifest was insanely strong. This happens like many times in many moments in my life, but since I started meditating I get a lot less nervous so I cannot use this ability as often.

How do I control this ability to manifest whenever I want and not only when  I am nervous, panicking or in difficult situation?",0
"When I was a kid, I would find myself while walking around,  and whenever I kind of ""felt"" like it, I could stare at an object and create this feeling of falling or butterflies in my stomach.

Today, as a grown middle aged man, I can still do this, although it's doesn't come as easy and I don't get the bizarre feeling of being surprised I'm ""here"".  

I can recreate this falling feeling especially when meditating or if I'm just walking around and stare at something intently enough.  

I've never heard of anybody else being able to do this.  I never thought to ask either.  Anybody?

"I've been meditating consistently once a day since 2012. The other night I was at a concert and my friend kept talking to me during a quiet song. A girl behind us rudely interrupted and said ""STOP TALKING"". Mind you, she was technically right--we shouldn't have been talking in that moment, but the way she did it was super abrasive and abrupt. 

What ensued was something I have not experienced before, and although it seems simple, it was actually pretty remarkable: I intuitively watched my emotional reaction to the occurrence. I observed the anger pulse through my chest and out to the rest of my body, and acknowledged that I was observing. I remained conscious, and didn't react to her in any way.

It might seem somewhat mundane, but these moments are crucial. It has always been an intellectual battle first and foremost to tell myself to be present. This came naturally and without much effort. The bottom line is it's easy to do your practice at home and get behind the routine, but it's in the ""real world"" where the practice becomes concrete. These are the little victories which signify that the practice is making you more conscious and aware.",0

"Hi, I have recently started meditation but know nothing about it. I have done some casual research as to how it works and most common practices and different types yogic breathing patterns. I feel meditation is now a clusterfuck of different methods in my head and I have no clear understanding(completion) of it. My process is simple 

1. I first try to hear out everything I can , expanding my range 
2. until finally I start drowning them all out, focusing just on my breathing 
3. I then begin to focus on the spot between my eyebrows without looking at that spot with my eyes (I read this somewhere and I have no idea why , I guess something to do with third eye)

I try to keep this up for as long as possible. I have not been perfect, I fail to be consistent , my mind might wander suddenly onto some thought but I am quickly back onto focusing on my breathing.  As I was doing this today, I had only felt like 7 mins had passed or maximum ten minutes no more , but when I opened my eyes it had been 40 minutes.

I would like to know from any of the internet experts over here if my processs is in anyway useful? or right?.

"Ive had a weird experience plently of times most occuring when i meditate. I get an energy rush usually starting from my spine that engulfs my whole body like a wave of blissful subtle numbness.

If my mind stays empty, I can achieve multiple bursts of these euphoric pulses go through my body. The feeling is best represented by when you get goosebumps by something you like or enjoy. You get that chill feeling that rushes over you, but for me its always been a pleasent thing, where I feel my body through this wave. 

Ive gone deep enough one time were it felt like my body was vibrating because of the subtle pulses I was creating. 

The weird thing is that the best pulses are created by the absense of thought, but also the feeling of comfortability. Ive been through weeks or even a month were I had been stressed or too hard on myself, and its been harder to channel these euphoric waves.

Can someone help me understand this effect better,
Thank you.",0
"I just recently started getting into mediation, I never thought I had enough time for it so I started doing short 5 minute sessions daily. 

Enjoying it so far but when I deep breathe it hurts a little bit. Like I start wheezing and I can feel my throat tighten. Definitely doesn’t feel relaxing and I’m not sure how to fix it.

I have mild asthma but no inhaler or anything.

"A semi-recent phenomenon I've been experiencing. During meditation, I can intensely focus on and subsequently ""feel"" certain sections of my head. Primarily, its either the very top of my head or the middle of my forehead, but I have had experiences feeling it on the sides of my head or sometimes more internally (not really identifiable anywhere on the outside of my head, I guess I'd say ""lower"" in my brain).

It's hard to describe what it feels like; the best I can give you is that it feels like an increase in pressure or heat in a localized area. I've found that in my deeper meditative states, I can ""drive"" the feeling to different sections of my head by focusing on the different locations.

Interestingly, I now feel it outside of meditation too. Reading a book or studying at work especially trigger it -- mainly high focus activities.

Any relatable experiences or explanations?",0

My  biggest obstacle to getting my life in order, down to basic hygiene:  Thoughts as well as (worse) emotions bubbling up. If I could anesthetize  them and be able to ignore my body, at least as a start, I'd probably  be getting out of the house much more regularly (for starters).

More  than anything is the craving for love and appreciation - obviously.  When I am reassured I have something to offer, I am calmer and able to  get my tasks done. I of course can't rely on other people like that,  especially since my obsession is the way I look.

I've  been recommended breathing meditation, and there have been times where  it has had a calming effect. Some other times it has had an irritating  effect.

I have heard there are  meditating techninques that have helped people deal with or reduce  physical pain without medication. I'd love to soak up in those.

I've read Tylenol is an antidote to the pain of social rejection (!) I have indulged in that when I wasn't in physical pain.

I don't have access to weed.

" 

These are some observations I made last night during a session. Hopefully it can help someone else (as I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while and I've read some incredibly helpful posts) 

Lately, I've been quicker and more alert to mood swings. Last night some anxiety crept in related to a social event I had just come back from and I really wanted to study it before I moved on. I've started to think about the judgements I draw on people as reflections of my innermost fears or desires. What's more likely- that I absolutely 100% know the truth about something I'm witnessing, or that I'm drawing conclusions based on what I think or how I feel about the situation? 

The latter is obviously more likely. And if this is the case, it allows me to open up to new possibilities about how wrong I am in believing so many things. Particular with anxiety and depression. Why am I giving such authority to so many paranoid and unwelcome thought patterns? Why do I trust these responses so readily? And also, why do I keep damaging myself with negative and unwanted self-perceptions? 

I've found that a subjective reality like the one we live in is somewhat dependant on our perception of it. There is magic in this if we can learn to influence it in a positive way. Or in my case, at least start questioning it. The sheer fact that there are other ways of viewing things and my way is not the most credible in any sense is like a breath of fresh air. 

Like hey, I don't know. Maybe those people really like me and I'm the one with the self-image problem. Maybe I should work on that instead. ",0

"So i have been meditating a half hour a day for 6 months now. Today at school, someone took my seat during lunch. So when he went to get his lunch i took my seat back. He later came back and pushed me off leading me to fall in front of all of my friends. I was thinking of fighting him right then and there, but then i realized that it just was not worth it, and i just sat somewhere else. I guess im making progress ;)

Edit: Let me clarify something, when i first claimed the seat i put my bag on it,went and got lunch. But apparently this guy pushed my bag off knowing it was mine. So when i came back he was in the lunchline and I asked is anyone sitting here, my friends just said sit down. So then he came back and pushed me off",0
"Healing means to restore balance. Meditation is an expression of the need to heal, to find balance. This why prayer, meditation, self-reflection, service, charity and alignment with the Higher Purpose is so important. Karma doesn't happen to us as much as within us. Creating more constructive causes, yields more constructive effects in daily life.

In order to understand what true health is we must understand karmic tendencies in our own body, speech and mind. Each moment we're generating ripples in our own aura which extend out into the greater Universe, then come back with increased force depending upon the energy given to them. These reactions, or effects create all of our life, experiences and relations with others.

All health, ill-health, success, failures, gains and losses are a result of seeds planted by the energy waves. When our intentions are blended with the Universal Good, we gradually achieve a more harmonious relationship. We are all subject to the Great Law of Karma, which is nested within the Great Law of Compassion.

Any unwanted results are not a punishment as much as the balancing of forces leaving our heart mind, then returning.",0
"Hi,

Title says it all really.  I have been practicing somewhat consistently but feeling restless in my practice.  While I’m focusing on my breath, Im curious about the multitude of different techniques out there and thought I’d ask reddit.

This leads me to my question - do you use an app, music, binaural beats, the sound of silence?  Do you focus on your breath, light, loving kindness? 
Do you make it as part of your routine? Have you ever felt like not doing it?

"I did my first attempt with meditating on a person I have the strongest wish they'd be happy, get anything they want in this world, etc. 

I was going over several people in my head, and I noticed I have this feeling toward (if wish they'd be happy) almost everyone, but for some people it's especially strong. In my case it was my ex-gf (who's the kindest person I know), and my brother. It's SO hard for me to choose between the two, but if I had I'd prob go with my brother. How about you? which person do you have the strongest feeling of well-wishing toward? Is it your sibling? parent? partner? friend?",0
"Hi all. I've just recently started meditating again with a committment to making it a daily habit and a lifestyle choice. I decided it would be best for me to get started with audio courses, since I don't really know what I'm doing, and find the guidance helpful to getting started.

What I'm currently struggling with however, is that recently my anxiety has shifted focus from being one purely about myself and surrounding factors, to the far wider scope of our planet and potential collapse of our ecosystems. This shift has been healthy for me on a personal level, but the shift also comes with its own challenges. A lot of the meditations I have done so far have made points of ""understanding that things will get better"" and that ""whatever current negativity there is in your life will pass"" and the issue is that if my mind wanders to these dark places, hearing messages like this seem the opposite of what I currently feel to be the case. 

Given that I have also resolved myself to no longer turning a blind eye to these challenges of our time, it does make this start to meditation feel more challenging as I feel a need for action and urgency on the above issues. Do you have any recommendations for this? Do I need to change my perspective somehow? Should I be following a certain course or aiming for a different outcome with my meditation? I definitely still feel the benefit of the time taken to meditate, but I know how much better it has felt when my scope was so much narrower and my negative emotions were easier to discredit.

TL;DR : Meditations stating how ""everything will get better"" clash with my current fear of the state of the planet deteriorating and dulls the effectivity of my meditations. Please help!",0

"Small background of me. I've been meditating for 3 years now, very consistently since I was 17 years old. I have got hundreds of hours of meditation and went to some meditation courses including a Vipassana Retreat.

What I've seen is a major theme is that I'm constantly aware of all the pain in my body 24/7 and get discomfortable with it. In deep meditation, this fixation subsides for up to an hour or so. But in daily life, since the moment I wake up, I feel lots of discomfortable sensations in my entire torso, belly and chest.

This pain is causing me lots of suffering. Some days I rush to go home to meditate. My goal is to feel bliss and ecstasy on my body. How to deal with this pain? Should I do a month long meditation retreat to learn to accept the pain?

I'm starting to doubt my meditation practice. Thank you.",0

"I've been practicing mindfulness meditation daily for about 3 months now, and I've found that whether I sit alone at home or I walk outside while doing the meditation, the results and benefits are largely the same.

I thought originally that sitting and ""doing as little as possible"" while watching my breath was best. **But whether I sit and stare at the wall, or walk along a path outside, my mind is still creating images.** If I sit alone, I just keep thinking. I can focus on my breath, but the thoughts continue on behind. If I'm walking, my thoughts are replaced instead by the images that change in my sight as I take my walk. And even as I focus on my breath, and basically think as little as possible, my body moves along automatically.

I thought this was interesting in part because it means you can meditate if you walk to work or take some form of non-driving transport (and so save some time in your day). It's also interesting that whether I think or not, my body will just keep doing what it needs to (so worry is truly pointless). I think this latter insight is one of the steps to a greater sense of peace in life.",0

"My big fear of meditation is I'll just end up making no progress in my life. I've seen many people who've meditated for a long time still have emotional outbursts, depression, and are very angry.

I know I ""shouldnt"" put a label on meditation on what it ""should"" or ""should not"" do, but I'm scared. Even my mindfulness teacher, who teaches people with OCD to be present, has depression at times. How can this be? I thought if you meditate enough, you'll have an inner peace hopefully long lasting.

For example, a guy who recently posted here talked about ""stealing back his chair"" and even got shoved out of it. I would've thought that after 6 months of meditation for 30 minutes for him would have had him not care so much that someone stole his chair. Maybe there is a subconscious reason as to why he got pushed out? I would imagine he would accept the situation and be ok with what is. Maybe even forgiving the fellow who stole his chair.

Another example is this girl who went on America's Got Talent claimed to have meditated for a long time. She then had a very big outburst and even crumpled up a piece of paper and threw it at the judges saying ""I'm not a number, I'm a person.""

So my concern is, why do these people still have these problems after meditating for long periods of time? I worry years after meditating I'll still have angry outbursts, still be depressed, still be unforgiving and hateful. I do not understand. Can someone please explain this to me? Thank you.",0
"Hello my lovely friends. I love the whole world. I have a question, when you meditate, do you have some sort of hypnagogia?

Today I noticed that if I lengthen my breathe on inhales and exhales(even controlling sometimes)I can focus on it much better. When controlling it,  the controlling of my breathing goes away pretty quickly because I'm also trying not to control it I'm trying to focus solely on the sensation of my breath around or in my nostrils.(if that makes sense).

"Hey everyone. I am relatively new to mediation and have a question:

I practice for about thirty minutes at a time and focus on relaxing muscles and body awareness. A few times in my practice I have gotten to a place where I am separate from my body--as if I have detached and my soul/awareness can move around within my own skin/limbs. I'm a total novice, but if I had to label this, then I'd call it hypnosis/trance. And I definitely want to explore it more. How can I do this? Anyone have familiar experience or guidance on more easily getting to this place? I have been able to get here only a few times.

I do self-guided meditations. Spend about five min focusing on breath, the next five body, and the next twenty relaxing each individual muscle. I use the imagery of butter melting on a warm skillet.

"Since clearing my mind Ive realised quite a few things: The few friends I have at the moment are shit and only use me . The popular girls who giggle around me dont think im cute, they think im just a a nerdy anorexic kid.I am ugly as fuck (before meditation I thought I looked half decent). I feel lonelier than ever. I can also sense the joy in others but I can't sense any joy in myself. There is no one who is there for me. The rest of my family is not even realising whats happening to me and frankly they wont care if I told them.


Where did I go wrong?",0
"My mind used to be filled with a constant inner monologue of thoughts, including escapist daydreaming, worry, analysis and imagined conversations. Via drugs I discovered a state where my mind had much longer periods of quiet. Within these periods I felt the world around me in a much more profound way. I noticed a lot more of what's around me, and in association with perception there were more of countless nameless feelings which seem like essences of what I'm perceiving. I guess this could be called seeing more beauty in the world around me, even in what's objectively mundane, common, average or imperfect. It's a state where I can even see beauty in what might objectively be called flaws and imperfections. This state reminded me of early childhood, before a terrible back and forth move from Croatia to Canada which made my mother worse put me into the worse state with constant inner monologue. Over time I learned how to quiet my mind while at the same time intentionally redirecting my focus onto my perception of the external world. I could do this even without drugs. It seemed like this kind of transformation was the main benefit of meditation. 

One time I had a disturbing experience with meditation. After meditation I felt refreshed and energized, and with motivation to take my difficult and emotionally abusive mother for a drive. Talking to her, even just trying to decide where to go, threw away the good state and put me into a worse state than before I meditated. This led to a decrease in interest in meditation.

Now I think I understand what was wrong. I was manipulating my awareness into a greater focus on present moment perception while not allowing a deeper connection to my body and associated emotions relating to sense of self.

Emotions relating to sense of self always seemed to be a source of suffering. If I want something but can't have it, or I don't like the way something is, or I'm afraid about something, then I can suffer about it. It is nicer to not have those concerns. Part of what I did by training myself to focus more on perception of the present moment is blocking out those concerns. But I'm not sure that I was ever very in touch with my body and associated emotions relating to sense of self. Even long ago memories of my childhood in Croatia seem to involve some tension and disconnection relating to this.

This seems like the opposite of what Buddhism talks about. Refusing to follow my own desires can cause suffering. Those emotions relating to sense of self can include various desires which can improve my life if fulfilled, and ignoring them can lead to worse experiences. Or in other words, I don't want to just become more selfless and love other people more; I need to love myself more!

Can meditation be useful for this? Which particular types of meditation or guided meditations are useful?",0
"Recently I’ve heard a lot about Transcendental Meditation and I — for one weak moment — almost got sucked in.

* First 5 minutes- Welcome &amp; Introduction 
* 30 minutes- Breathing and meditation 
* 20 minutes- Group discussion. Q&amp;A

A virtual meditation session and activating chakras. Channelizing energy in your body to bring clarity to mind and energize your center. We will discuss the details (science &amp; spirituality) behind the concept of the energy centers. It is known when these centers slow down people begin ageing. Activating these energy centers in the body would essentially not only cleanse negative emotions but also manifest is physically stronger healthier and younger bodies. 

In the session we shall start with an activity where everyone checks if they are breathing correctly. And then a gentle warm up to make sure the body and joints are prepared to sit for 20 mins of meditation. Then we will take everyone through  the Meditation where we activate the centers through sound vibrations for each energy center. We end with a discussion (optional) and Q&amp;A.",0
"I know we can use mantras, physical objects, sound etc., but most big teachers that I know of (mingyur rinpoche, Suzuki roshe, chogyam trungpa, pema chodron, Andy puddicombe etc.) all point to focusing on the breath as the go to method so to speak. 

I just wonder why that is - is there something that is inherently ""better"" or easier about it? 

I've been meditating on the breath everyday for 5 years but have recently considered trying another technique since it, to me, isn't the most intuitive and straight forward thing to do (long explanation for another thread) 

Would love to hear if anyone has gone from focusing on breath to another object (not objectless meditation) and what their experience was. I'm considering mantra but don't really know",0

"Hello. I meditate pretty often, and have definately seen the benefits from it in my own life, as well as hearing many success stories from people in this sub and other places. Both my mom and my girlfriend suffer from anxiety, and despite me trying my hardest to convince them that meditation can significantly help, they dont believe me. To make matters worse, my girlfriend is a nurse and thinks she is 100 times smarter then me in the medical field. She thinks ""there is no way lying down for 10 minutes a day and focusing on my body will help"" and then gets mad when I even try to give any facts or success stories about meditation because she ""knows what will help anxiety cause shes a nurse"". In fact any time I try to bring it up its ""insulting to her intelligence"" and I ""dont respect the level that her anxiety is at"". Anyways, do you guys know how I could pitch it better or be more convincing that this is worth their time?",0

"I didnt really know where else to share this so im putting it here. It happened a few years ago when I was still experimenting with meditation, just like any other one of my sessions. I dont really recall why or how it happened, but for maybe a few seconds or maybe even a minute, I experienced an intense pleasure that I cant describe. All I remeber is that it felt really good, not like temporary pleasure, but rather a deep fufilling sensation. 

I have never been able to replicate that sensation, probably because I was consciously trying to achive that state, but I really want to get back into it once I have more time. If anyone knows what that, ""state"" is, can you share more information on what it is and how it works. Im intrested to know more about it since I havent heard many people talk about it before.",0

"Recently, I started healing from trauma. 

I got to a safe place, where I don't have to deal with danger on a daily basis any more, but I still couldn't shake the intense fear, so yesterday I decided to meditate on death. It felt really liberating. I started to just picture the feeling I got in near death experiences and it really gave me perspective. (Mind you, not in a suicidal kind of way, I am quite keen on living). 

I started doing some research on it and there is a lot info out there.

I would like to hear your experience too? 

Does anybody practice it? 

What is your take on it?",0
"I'm using ""pull"" for lack of a better term here.

Since starting my inward journey, I always felt like I was pretty good about not being attached to anything. Of course, I never had any frame of reference for that feeling other than my past self.

However, during meditation today, I noticed inside myself that I had a slight ""pull"" towards the things I'm attached to. Imagine you're at work: during the day, you have this unconscious awareness of the general direction of your home, and this awareness of where your car is in the parking lot, all sort of unconsciously drawing your attention to them ever so slightly, even though you can't even see them. You probably also get the same effect when you put your phone down. That's the ""pull"" I'm talking about.

When I noticed this energy I was exerting towards the objects I was attached to, I made a conscious effort to sort of ""draw it back in,"" if you will. This allowed me to meditate with myself in such a way I had never experienced before.

Now, even afterwards, my draw towards other unhelpful things I used to really identify with (like drinking, watching TV, playing videogames) all have noticeably less control over me, and more meditation is honestly at the front of my mind now. I would highly suggest everyone try this out if they haven't yet. I can't promise it will have the same effect for you as it did for me, but I can promise that my effect was profound enough to warrant me sharing my first post on this sub! Good luck!",0

The above link is about fixing the energies tied to the conflict in Syria, to manifest peace. It is explained in the link the true reason why peace in this region is so important. Please give it a chance and try it out. Meditating certainly isn't the only way you can help to create peace. There is much that needs to happen in the physical realm as well. But a 15 minute mass meditation can't hurt! Heres some proof of the positive effect of mass meditation on the community:

You can do the meditations on this site, even if it is not the exact time of  the meditation schedule. There are also many other different mass meditations on the home page of the website I linked.

The following link is a few free pages about how to do the merkaba meditation (recreating your human lightbody)- 




https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.interdimensionalhealinglight.com/merkabah-star-tetrahedron.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjU44iIzO7jAhUQFnwKHQtlAgYQFjAAegQIBRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0svLr62SVCYtSMhnd2-rC7



This meditation, if done while feeling love energy, will release negativity and blockages from your chakras and open them up, thus restoring proper energy flow in your body, and improving your health. It can also change your consciousness to a higher dimensional awareness of peace, love and harmony with all life everywhere.


I highly suggest giving this meditation a try. Here is a guided audio link on YT of the merkaba meditation:




https://youtu.be/81Kf3UBQ1g8




Its from the book ""the ancient secrets of the flower of life part 2"".  The book also teaches spiritual anatomy of your 13 chakras,  healing, psychic powers, how to cast out entities/demons from your energy field, how to reconnect to mother earth,  the cosmos and your higher self,  and talks about a few intergalactic conspiracies and the current great awakening!


Here is another very useful meditation called the unity breath. It goes hand in hand with merkaba meditation. It will allow you to tap into a stream of infinite healing love energy:

"Do you need supervised guidance to learn how to meditate? Or can you teach yourself from simple instructions from for example a video? I've been dabbling with meditation for some years, and am wondering if it is just one of those things you won't make proper progress without supervision of some sorts.

In particular, I'm reading about Acem meditation, a book called The Power of the Wandering Mind. Acem meditation is a type of mantra meditation which they call a non-directive technique. They seem to be holding some of the cards close, and I'm sceptical whether they are more interested in making money from their business, then they are about spending knowledge about meditation. The book is very interesting however.

Edit: Thanks for the responses. My conclusion is that while you can learn to meditate self-taught, you get farther with a teacher and a community. I also feel like no one has a patent on what is the key to correct meditation, so there is little reason to go to an expensive retreat to learn a specific technique. I think also if you don't always have a teacher or a community, talking to a friend who also meditates may be valuable.",0
Never felt more attracted to a religious book more than theirs. I made this meditation video/audio and laced some vedas being read by my girl through it.

"Hey all! 

Thanks for taking the time to check out my post. I really want to share two experiences I've had over the last few days :)

First  is- I've recently gotten my dedicated Puja table set up- it's nothing big or fancy- it's actually a very old vanity bench that used to be my grandmother's. I covered it with a pashmina and decorated it with a couple small candles, a little Ganesha lamp, some books (The Bhavagah-Gita, Be Here Now by Ram Dass, and Secret Heart- a collection of Rumi poems), other likenesses of enlightened beings. I love it. It's really nice to have that space just for me and just for Sadhana.  But I've noticed now when I come out of mediation my dog Roxie and my cat Luna are always with me. Roxie on my left, Luna on my right. I just think that is the sweetest, most beautiful thing ever. They have such sheet souls- and I never call them in there with me- I start my meditation practice alone and when I end and open my eyes, they are there. &lt;3 Anyone else have this experience?

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, last week I got really lucky and found a copy of The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying by Sogyal Rinpoche at a local used book store. I've been interested in reading this book for quite some time. On Thursday night when I started reading, as I carefully moved through the pages I felt my body expanding bigger and bigger...It was almos tlike I was tripping...I kept blinking and  looking at the words harder ad harder-knowing I was holding the book incapable of explainging the sensation with any logic.  It was magic. I felt as big as the trees in the front yard! 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks again for reading any comments or discussion welcomed.",0
"I feel I already basically know what the form of the answer is going to be to this question; ""...there are many differing schools of thought..."", ""...it's difficult to say..."", etc., but I was wondering if there was any general consensus on the reality of becoming truly enlightened, and if it's considered to be an objective and absolute state of mind inside/outside of Buddhism. Is it a ""0 or 1"" type thing or can somebody be only slightly enlightened? Is there a science to being sure of the claims made about any of this outside of experiencing it for oneself? I've had some experiences with psychedelics that have surely pushed the upper bounds of how in-the-moment and one-with-everything a person can be. Is there a good reason to believe that these experiences were very different from achieving this state of mind naturally? Thanks for any considerable thoughts.",0

"Read Part 1 here: [https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/d2sbwg/why_is_meditation_so_hard_because_of_the_monkey/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/d2sbwg/why_is_meditation_so_hard_because_of_the_monkey/)


My previous article, Why Meditation is so hard had one comment that resonated with a lot of people:



*we are stuck in the space between hell and heaven. The Light has come, so we can’t go back to the old ways. But the monkey is also still there, so we don’t feel peaceful either.*

*This is the worst state to be, because you feel you have lost the material world, but not yet gained the spiritual.*





## My Own Struggle



At one point, I loved video games. I could easily spend hours stuck in a game.



Then I grew bored of them-- I felt they were exactly like real life, exactly **like work**, in fact. You do a lot of pointless actions that lead to pointless results. Kill zombie, move to 2nd floor, kill bad guys, get key, rinse and repeat. I felt the games were like life-- a lot of routine and mechnical grinding work for no real benefit. Soon, I had dozens of games I had paid, but never finished.


I also was writing books, novels and trying to build a business, but all these things started feeling hollow to me. I was like, why am I doing  this? I had started all of it to make money, become famous, to Be The Man(TM), but it all felt fake and meaningless. 



## The Dissolution of the Ego, and it's Attempt to Recreate Itself



Meditation leads to a weakening (and eventual dissolution) of the ego-- and by ego I mean the attachment  to our routine thinking mind. The mind starts thinking it is the boss, and starts bullying the body and other thoughts around, which leads to most of our problems.



In my own example, I  used to think I was this *Stud Muffin Writer / Programmer / Soon to be Millionaire Businessman*(TM) . I couldn't sit quietly for 2 minutes- I always had to be doing something. And boy was my productivity high. I was writing novels, a popular blog, selling online courses. I could do anything...



... except sit quiet for 2  minutes. Anytime I tried to meditate, I would get angry. As in, mouth frothing mad dog angry. I tried to power through it, but now realise this is a horrible way. A better way (if meditation makes you angry) is to practice compassion and forgiveness, but that is another topic (let me know if you want me to write about it).



So recently, when I started losing my interest in all things I did, I felt I was going mad. As I told my wife, if I am not a writer / business guy, *what am I?* As Raman Maharishi said, something I felt was very stupid, **Who am I?** 



(I since found out from Adyashanti that a better meditation is **What am I?**)



And so I felt lost and hopeless. I had lost all my interests, but had not gained any spiritual benefits. I still felt f'in miserable. 



And this is a big problem-- meditation weakens the ego, it's hold on the body/mind, but the ego fights back. It has been the boss for so long, it ain't gonna give up just cause you chanted *Om shanti shanti* a few times.


And this is another problem many meditators face. Marketing tells them meditation should make them feel all *lubby dubby*, floating the in the air giving hugs to strangers. In practice, they feel shit. This is because there is a huge gap between marketing and the hard truth on the street. Meditation is a not a pill you can pop to cure your depression, no matter what all those best selling books say!

And so the ego tries to trick you:



* It makes you feel hopeless and lost

* You might feel you are going crazy

* You might feel everything is an illusion, that nothing matters anyway (*which if true, why do you feel so miserable? The ego has no answer, only doubts*)



Many people give up. I have given up too. Giving up is ok, because your inner self will not let you quit that easy; it will always bring you back, gently and slowly.


## The Battle Between Passions and Peace



And so we come back to our original problem. What do we do when we lose the material world, but haven't gained the spiritual world?



As I said, meditation, over time, leads to a weakening of the ego. The ego is our identification to the non-stop stream of thinking.

The problem is— the mind wants something to “identify” with, something external. So it will keep trying to create an identity for you, and feel depressed. The hopelessness and groundlessness you feel is **not you, it is the mind**. the mind feels out of control and helpless.

The mind **wants** something to grab on to, something to hold, something to give it stability. That is  why it is so scared all the time, because ultimately, there *is nothing to hold on to*. The ego, like I’ve written before, is like a soap bubble floating in the sun. It has no existence, it can pop anytime, and worst of all (from the ego’s viewpoint), **it knows this**.

And so the ego is scared all the time. It fights your meditation, it throws a tantrum anytime you make any progress, it makes you think you are crazy, or losing it, or wasting your time. 

And we haven’t even talked about passions.

### What Stars Wars taught me about meditation

*Go on, Luke, give in to your passions. Give in to the hate, and you will be with the Dark side* — a dude called Palpatine

For a long time, I couldn’t understand why the Emperor walked Luke to give in to his passions.

Nowadays, passion means good things. Silicon Valley wants you to be “passionate” about your job, by which they mean be willing to work overtime without extra pay. We are expected to “follow our passions”, and you are screwed if your passion is something that doesn’t make money, like collecting stamps or writing poetry. No, your passion has to be about something the market wants, like Jabbascript programming or accounting or family law. Yawn.

But passion originally meant suffering. Check the dictionary. The “Passion of the Christ” is not a story about how Jesus built a Web 2.0 blog using FaceTube.

Passions, if the you read the original Greek stoic texts, are run away emotions that take over us. They happen most commonly during meditation— if you have felt really angry or depressed or emotional during meditation, those are passions. We usually keep them suppressed by distracting ourselves, but they jump up and take over the mind anytime we are vulnerable, like hungry or tired, or when we try to sit quietly.

So the Emperor wasn’t asking Luke to work on his passion to build a Wordpress blog; he was telling him to let his wild emotions, raw anger and fear, take over, and let them rule his life.

We have all heard of examples of this.  Anytime you hear of someone killing another person in a road rage incident, they gave in to their passions. Their emotions went out of control and took over the mind. The rational mind became a passenger at this point. It could complain, but it wasn’t the one driving.

You have felt the passions too-- anytime you have screamed at a loved one, spouse, parents or children, and almost or completely destroyed your relationship. You may have later felt ashamed, feeling like you had been possessed by a demon.

And you were. This demon is the monkey, plus all the pent up rage and emotions you have been suppressing your whole life. At some point, all that shit just blows up.

And that is the 2nd reason meditation is so hard. We have been suppressing  our emotions, suppressing the monkey within us so long, he waits when we are weak and vulnerable and strikes back.

Like I said in the previous post, you have to make peace with the monkey, not fight him.

One way to control passions is to practice compassion and forgiveness. All real spiritual paths have compassion or service as a core tenet. Buddhists have metta, Hindus have kshama/seva, while Christianity was based on forgiveness (no comment on how well these religions do this in practice).

Compassion and forgiveness is what brings the monkey under control, because they are the things he cannot fake; the monkey (or ego) can pretend to be a great enlightened guru, he can give inspiring speeches, and be all spiritual; but he can never show compassion or forgiveness. And hence never feel peace.   

### Forgiveness is the Key to Fast Meditation

The mind is like a hot stove, red hot with heat. It burns you, causes you discomfort, but you can't turn off the heat.

Meditation is the key to cooling the mind- meditation is what turns the heat off.

Compassion/Forgiveness is like sprinkling cold water with your fingers on the stove. It speeds up the cooling process. You don't need compassion, but without it the journey will take a lot longer.

Which is why meditation can't be something you ""do"" for an hour each day, then go about your normal life. Meditation is something that must be done throughout the day (to the best of your ability, remembering that self shaming is a weapon of the ego, and self-compassion is the best form of compassion).

Once you stop putting in heat into the mind (in the form of angry / hateful thoughts), the mind will eventually cool down, giving you the peace you want. It just takes time.

"It has been often said, both in Vedic, Buddhist and other writings that if we want accomplishment, develop a dispassionate attitude towards results. This runs counter to our Western society which says, if you can't measure it, it doesn't exist.

The ancient wisdom found in the Vedas, Buddhism and long standing wisdom traditions is based in an understanding of faith in karmic methods in order to create an atmosphere in the mind where good will emerge more easily if the motivation for practice is purified. Hence, the need for increased communal awareness, Bodhicita and compassion. In a real sense, your practice is part of a reorientation for the welfare of not only yourself, but the space of the world around you.  What benefits you, will in turn benefit the community. There is an inherent interdependence between all of us, especially those working diligently to improve the quality of life for humanity as a whole.

At the outset of meditation practice, think of the welfare of yourself as linked to those you know, love and cherish. Then think of the larger spheres of friends, colleagues, neighbors, and continuing outward. 

Wishes for success in you practice.",0
"Don't even know where to start with this. I sat down and set insight timer to 35 minutes. Began with some focus on the breath and tried my best to center myself and distance myself from surface level thoughts.

Got that done pretty quickly so then I started to become aware of my emotional state a bit and just as I was about to do it - a wild boner appears. So I try my best to focus on that sensation but it becomes a struggle not to be distracted by overly sexual thoughts and/or desires. Eventually I recenter myself and the boner subsides. But then I get a few more boners one after the other. At this point I know how the whole cycle goes so I manage to be pretty aware of it all, just an observer.

Ok great, passed that ""level"". At this point I'm feeling pretty deep into the session and the ending bell already went off a bit before. but I decided to keep going. I start to notice this lingering tension around my right shoulder, probably a point in my upper trapezius actually. So I decide to put all my focus on that. Soon after I just feel this radiation of tension and pain through my entire upper trapezius, shoulder, neck. First the entire right side radiates and then I feel some of my left. I try my best to just observe. Moment after moment this radiation just becomes stronger and stronger. At this point I feel like my body is burning and there is nothing to be felt or observed except that immense tension and pain.

Can't explain this better than like this: I know that the pain is just in my upper body but it felt like it was all there is, that that pain IS my body and nothing else. This becomes more and more difficult to keep doing and I try my best to just let it all go but I just couldn't. So I keep observing it for as long as I could but eventually I just abruptly stopped my session.

I took my phone and checked insight timer: 55 minutes.  
When I stopped the session I was left with a feeling of huge soreness and pain and still that higher body temperature. It felt something like I overdid it in the gym and was incredibly sore from it + that somebody beat me up real good after that gym session.

So now after this I'm a bit more aware of all the tension and pain that I'm storing inside of myself. Not a pretty sight at all. I guess all I can do is keep going and eventually let it all go.

If anyone has any advice on how I could do this, it would be much appreciated. Thanks!",0

"So I posted previously, a couple of weeks ago I think that I has a feeling of tremendous joy envelop me while meditating.

I haven't tried to chase that, I don't meditate for that reason, but have only felt that again fleetingly.

Since yesterday or so, I've had a feeling following me around like I'm about to ""break through"" whatever on earth that means and the sensation of joy came again to me during my meditation session I just finished along with a feeling of heat and passed quite quickly.

To try and describe it, it's almost like something sat on the top of my head while meditating, and like something following me around constantly (sounds like I'm going mad, I know) and also like I could perceive it but not quite, if that makes sense.

I hope this makes sense to someone. I know this is because of my meditation practice and because of the sensation of joy that I get during meditation.

2. Is it advisable to do any physical exercise?
3. Would 'journal-ling' help? My therapist vaguely recommended it but I'm not sure if it'll help to do that during the retreat, or after.
4. Any \[other\] changes I can make to get the best out of this?",0
"For me, I recently found this guy, Francis Lucille, who explains things in an absolutely crystal clear manner, probably due to his past background as a scientist/mathematician. I find that a lot of teachers from religious/new age backgrounds tend to result in me getting more confused as I struggle to grasp their nomenclature, even though I am personally more inclined towards the woo-woo and the emotive rather than the rational. Atheistic teachers like Sam Harris also tend to leave me cold for some reason.

So, which teachers or approaches do you follow? What has worked for you so far?",0
"I've been meditating daily since January this year, usually 4 times a day for 15 minutes. I used to have a lot of anxiety and negative thinking patterns but over time with meditation these have faded. I'm a lot more positive and optimistic and I don't really experience anxiety everyday like I used, however I still get some every now and again.

Since the end of April this year I would meditate and experience a kind of heightened awareness of everything around me that would last several hours. I would get better clarity of my vision and I felt more in the present moment than I ever have. Everytime I meditated I would usually feel these effects. 

This lasted till a few weeks ago and now when I mediate I still practice the same techniques however it feels like I don't get the same effects or I do they just feel a lot weaker.

Has anyone had this before where it seems like 
the effects of meditation is plateuing?

Edit: The techniques I use are I start by paying attention to the sound around me and just noticing all sound as noise not giving them any specific name just noise, I then do some breathing meditation followed by a body scan and some visualisation, I'll then do some breathing techniques where I'll inhale for 3 seconds, hold for 3 and exhale for 3 and continue doing this for a while. Recently as of two weeks ago, I finish with some metta meditation, although I'm fairly new to this type of meditation so I'm still learning. I think the main form of meditation I practice and have a good understanding of is mindfulness.",0
So I went to a mindfulness course. It was full of well adjusted women. Not a single male. Females are for a fact more in tune with their mental state than men.,0

"I can’t find a perfect place to meditate. Everywhere around me is noisy, I have to share my room with others and  I don’t want them to find me meditating. So I do it after everybody’s asleep.",0
"So I went through a really bad breakup.  I wasn't in a good place when I started the relationship and I got attached to this guy and was incredibly insecure. The breakup was terrible, I became obsessed with wanting answers and trying to fix it. This is a tendency of mine I forgot to be mindful of this time around.

But I finally did it. It's difficult to explain, but I let it go. I let him think whatever it is that he thinks of me. I accepted that our path was meant to end here. There is no need to fix it, no need to explain, no need to control it anymore. And this letting go has ""transferred"" itself into everything else as well. And one funny thing is that my rather chronic shoulder tension has been melting away. I'm able to simply sit back and observe and allow even if there is still lingering sadness. It's so much more peaceful, now.",0
"I didn’t do everything correctly, but what felt correct to me. I feel so connected to the earth, and my soul is starting to experience neutrality. I never thought I would feel this way. It’s amazing.",0
"A tiger just listens to his biology and he's already a full fledged tiger but the human beings plight is different. Being a human means your biology is in your hands.  Now when you become compulsive and listen to your cravings and do things on autopilot you're not experiencing life as a human **being.** Once you act **consciously** from the way you sit, stand, talk, breath, think, your posture etc then you're being a human being and you can evolve.  We've been acting compusivley for a while so there's going to be a time delay and a learning curve but that's why persistence is key. It doesn't matter if you fail 100 times today you will try again, and if you fail 100 more times you'll try again. Lots of people don't start living until they're on their death bed which is tragic, let's not wait until then. It doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it consciously.",0
"So I have this type of mindfulness, mediation, I don't really know what to call it, that involves making sure the feeling one each lateral half (downt the vertical axis) of the face is 'balanced' or 'even'. I find this feel pleasant, especially when I'm relaxed, particularly walking down the road some reason. It's makes me feel very non-judgemental and careful, a good feeling really. I thought this sub might be interested in the idea, seeing as I have never seen it referenced or talked about anywhere else. What do you think?",0

"What kind of watch is it? What is your opinion on the level of distraction and or seeing others wear watches to meditation/yoga/fitness practice?

I’m receiving mix feelings, some articles say it’s no big deal to wear a watch. And yet yoga teachers have gone as far as put signs up that forbids wearing apple watches to class. What are your thoughts and 2 cents? Is it really no big deal?",0
"Hey everyone, after having a personal crisis, I'm interesting in starting meditation as part of my healing

I looked through the internet and in reddit, and found so many applications..

How would you recommend me to start? Which app do you use, and what are your insights?

Sorry if there were similar posts, the one I found were either old or made me more confused..

Thanks!",0
"I’ve been seeing a lot of similar things since joining this sub. That I’m not my thoughts. That I’m not my emotions. That I’m not solely my body or my mind. That I’m not my mistakes. 

So what am I? My actions? I have trouble with that concept. I have had serious problems with self worth. I tend to define myself by my accomplishments or peoples perceptions/words about me. 

How do I know who I am? What should I be searching for? What if I don’t like who or what I am?",0
"In my humble opinion, one of the biggest myths about meditation is that to meditate means to empty your mind. Stillness of the mind is something that may take years and years to reach. If a beginner sets out to meditate with this unrealistic goal, it's a sure way to lose motivation and give up meditation. That's exactly what happened to me about 4 years ago because I believed this myth too. A lot of people don't even start meditation because they feel THEIR mind has non-stop thoughts. 

I believe the goal of meditation, especially for a beginner, is to OBSERVE one's thoughts, not stop them. 

I made this short video to clarify this idea and offer some tips for beginners.

"I've been meditating for a few months now and have gotten up to doing 30-40 minute sessions. Usually just samatha alone, I have started to get down the breath concentration pretty well. But everytime I try to go into vipassana meditation from samatha I start getting distracted with my mind wandering much more than with samatha. Its frustrating. I do the noting technique when i do vipassana, noting my abdomen movements rising falling etc. Whenever my mind wanders I always note it and return to my abdomen when I realize I've drifted off. 

I'm wondering if I should continue doing this practice and it will get easier, or do I need to keep practicing samatha and eventually go back to vipassana. Am I doing something wrong? Or should I just keep at it and push through?",0
"Yesterday, my mother suggested I meditate and something in me really wanted to, so later in the evening I meditated after yoga for 9 minutes with a meditation playlist in the background. I was really surprised once I came out of my meditation. Inside I felt much more calm and during the meditation, I felt a vibration in my mouth that slowly grew on my chest and one portion of my face. Once I finished meditating, I let out a little cry that was satisfying and joyous. Along with that, for part of yesterday and today I’ve had more realizations and contentment about my life. Today, I meditated again and felt like I was in water. I had slight passing vibrations that weren’t as strong during my 12 minute session. I’m hoping to continue meditating every day now despite having school, but I’m really surprised my first time went well.",0

**FULL REVIEW** 

Video review: [https://www.facebook.com/liveanddare/videos/905385073160464/](https://www.facebook.com/liveanddare/videos/905385073160464/)

Links and research [here](https://liveanddare.com/mantra-meditation#Transcendental_Meditation).

&amp;#x200B;

**Overview / Summary**

I'm often asked if I recommend the TM technique/organization. I don't. And this video I discuss 5 reasons why not.  
(1) Identity Confusion — it's a spiritual approach to mantra meditation disguised as secular.

(2) Questionable Marketing — ex-TM teachers (and whistleblowers) have come out to say that the mantras are not unique to the individual. If that is the case, they shouldn't be advertized as if they were.

(3) The Effortlessness Myth — the core assumption of TM about meditation is flimsy at best.

(4) Cultish Background — More a problem in the past than right now, but worth being aware of. Warnings have been issued about the dangers of TM by the German government, the Vatican, the Cult Awareness Network, the Task Force on Missionaries and Cults

(5) Dubious Research — the papers that TM is based on to argue its ""superiority"" over styles of meditation are weak, and their conclusions are dubious.

(Note: all of this is just my own opinion, made based on many hours of research and talking with long-term TM practitioners.)

"I always found the idea of meditation to be sitting in quiet contemplation.

I was stupid wrong.

I’ve found through physical therapy that certain poses have certain spiritual energy surrounding them.

I honestly don’t know how to put it better but it’s something I can replicate and reproduce every time I get down on the floor now. It’s very weird.

If I hold these poses long enough I can feel the dissolving of my surroundings and my connection to my sensations

It’s like having both a physical and mental alignment in my imagination like a perfectly still unbroken surface of a lake.

It’s extremely visceral and gives me the shudders in an almost creepy way and I’ve lost time stuck in this moment of static energy.

Like balancing a pin perfect on its tip or walking an internal tightrope with your body.

It also has had massive implications in how interpret my own thinking and impulses, realising now they are truly optional",0
"When I meditate before bed I often feel a surge of serious restlessness and the need to move. I try to fight through it but I feel so uncomfortable to the point that after a minute of two I have to stop meditating. However, when I meditate 15 mins after I wake up it’s relaxing and I often try to stop my self from falling asleep. Not sure if it’s relevant but I have adhd which could be a factor in this happening. Also for contest I’ve been meditating 10-30 mins for 6 months consistently",0
"Recently meditation has been more than amazing for me (specially because I switch from doing so only at night and doing it in the morning as well) but I get a little stressed sometimes if I meditate less than an hour, thinking what my day will be without the ""right amount of time"".",0
"I've found lately that my favorite form of meditation is going for a walk without my cell phone. My imagination comes to me instantly as I wander through my subdivision, staring up at the pale blue sky. I love to cloud watch as I walk. I feel my mind instantly wanting to soar through the clouds like an airplane. Especially when you can see the shape of the moon peeking through the clouds in the evening sky. I imagine myself to feel weightless, although I am walking and my feet remain on the Earth. I take a deep breath and all of me is drifting away.",0
" 

I have found that those with **energy imbalance/grounding issues** look for guidance everywhere. They search all over the internet - read many articles, blogs, forums ; meet many doctors and therapists ; spends a lot of time, money and energy, yet they did not find something substantial that could give them the confidence that the problem could be solved in short span of time.

Many lose hope. Many lose the most important years of their life; some lose their jobs, relationships,etc.

For whatever this may have happened, I would always suggest someone to **learn from authentic teachers/organisation** who have years of specialisation  in this area.

I have done a lot of research on this topic.

A **Multi-prong approach** is needed to deal with this issue-

1. **GROUNDING EXERCISES-**

After unprepared awakening, energy gets stuck especially in throat, back of head, sinuses, shoulders,etc.

I am of the opinion that if we can **clear air passage ways with certain exercises** (TMJ, Neck, Sinus release exercises) , then its going to make huge difference in the way one feels.

All this exercises are aimed to - **clear Nasal pathway for air** and later **direct flow of breath along central channel of energy** **(Sushumna nadi)**.

We want **more and more air to flow through nose**, so that intensity of ""**fight and flight**"" mode can be reduced drastically. We are trying to hit from different angle to clear nose while doing the TMJ, neck, sinus release exercises.

I believe that many of the important psychic channels are in nose. So **clearing nasal passage** is of immense importance in dealing with energy imbalance issue.

Here are exercises you can consider doing-

* **ZHANG ZHUANG QIGONG STANDING MEDITATION**
* **DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING**
* **SINUS, NECK, TMJ EXERCISES**
* **STANDING MEDITATION- THE MASTER EXERCISE FOR ALL ENERGY IMBALANCE ISSUES**

&amp;#x200B;

2. **UNVEILING KNOT/GRANTHI IN NAVEL REGION-**

Brahma Granthi creates restlessness and inability to meditate. To unveil it one has to rise above thoughts, emotions and ego associated with lower 3 chakras with awareness and faith. Knowledge and awareness is the key. I'll give suggested book list.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Brahma Granthi is the first major block that sadhaka need to transcend. This granthi keeps a person under the illusion of the material benefits, physical pleasures, lethargy, ignorance and uncertainty.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Among all the most powerful is an illusion of physical pleasure. This granthi plays an important role, because it is responsible for the material man's thinking. It creates a kind of attraction in the nature of the human mind.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Illusions that are created by Brahma Granthi, may be represented as:  
• Permanent sexual thoughts and sexual activity  
• Permanent hunger, which is difficult to satisfy  
• Need of money, land and other tangible things  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The opening of this knot may also be due to some problems for the sadhaka, because it causes a strong increase of fever, a very strong desire of sexual satisfaction and a strong motivation for the material desires.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The work of this granthi associated with three major chakras - Muladhara chakra, Svadhishthana chakra and Manipur chakra.

&amp;#x200B;

One has to become **hollow and empty** from within. **Freeing subconscious and unconscious mind of suppressed/unconscious emotions and ego with knowledge and awareness is the key to unveil this knot.** One should be able to identify and differentiate between emotion/set of emotions/different flavours of ego when they arise in nervous system.

&amp;#x200B;

* **CRANIAL OSTEOPATHY/ CRANIOSACRAL THERAPY**

&amp;#x200B;

* **BACH FLOWER REMEDY**

It helps to **dissolve negative emotions** in the system like fear, uncertainty, over sensitivity, lack of interest, etc and **helps the body heal itself**.

When you forcefully awaken the energy, it tries to get rid of all the negativity or suppressed emotions from system and the Bach flower Remedy speeds up this process.

I highly recommend BACH FLOWER REMEDY.

HOPE THESE HELPS!! ALL THE BEST!!",0
"In a 2018 paper about monastic academies of the future, M. Bukiet lists three classic texts documenting the work of contemplative adepts. He thinks these will be central teachings for all future contemplatives.

&gt;Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras  
&gt;  
&gt;Tsongkhapa’s “The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment”  
&gt;  
&gt;Buddhaghosa’s “The Path of Purification”

I have not read the last two but plan to look into them for consideration. My current top three are:

* Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras
* Takpo Tashi Namgyal’s “Mahamudra: The Quintessence of Mind and Meditation
* Harold D. Roth trans. of “Original Tao: Inward Training (Nei-yeh)""

I know that there are many here that probably have many other resources in mind, not just three. But if you had to rank ***your top three*** resources for mediation purposes, what would they be?

Thanks for sharing.",0

"I normally do sitting meditation but lately I've been trying to meditate while lying in bed, either on my back or on my side, but it's like I can't even get started. I don't understand it, it's like I can't focus on the breath while having it ""feel good"" like it does in sitting meditation. Anyone know why this might be? Sometimes I can focus on the breath while lying down but it seems like it doesn't really go anywhere, like it's just a mechanical process or me forcing myself to follow the breath. 

Also what is really funny is that when I do sitting meditation too late at night, I'll get very drowsy and start nodding off, however, when I lay down in bed to go to sleep I am suddenly wide awake, and so I try to meditate laying down, and it doesn't make me sleepy at all, lol.",0
"I've been really wanting to get into meditation; I love the idea behind it and I see how powerful it can be. I've been reading the book 'The Mind Illuminated' to try and help me on this journey, the only issue is I was doing great with it. I was making a daily habit with mediation, I did for about a month, I got my practice up to 25-30 minutes a day. Life was good. It was easy to do with a still mind.

Well, things have changed. A lot of problems have risen within my family life, work life, and relationship life. Simply put, there are some BIG changes coming which are perceived as negative as of right now.. with all of these issues, my anxiety, depression, stress has been at an all time max. it constantly feels like my mind is cluttered and going a million miles an hour. I began putting meditation to the side because I felt too depressed to even try, it was too much ""effort"". I want to bring it back into my life because I felt like before I was just beginning to get the positive effects from meditation.. now each time I try and sit I can't seem to shut off that constant chatter, the obsessing looping thoughts - no matter how hard I try I can't push them away and focus on my breath. Being mindful has been difficult because things have been going to badly, it's almost as if I subconsciously do not want to be in the moment. 

How do I stop this and get that focus back?",0
How do I get back into meditation habit? I used to feel so good but I can’t do it recently these last few months have been rough since I got depersonalization. Meditation helped but now that it’s not as bad I stopped. I really need to mediate but for some reason I just can’t. I feel like crying right now. My mind is so mean to me. I tell myself I can’t feel love and I’m selfish and it’s not true I think I hope I just feel so lost right now. I don’t know how to act or what to do or what is right in social situations. I don’t know if this is what it’s like to be an adult or what happens when you leave adolescence behind but I can’t stop thinking about myself and I’m so insecure. Meditation used to make me feel so calm and good I feel like an asshole lately. I don’t even know why I’m wrong this right now. I used to think  it was cool to be a sociopath and it was a weird phase I idolized them but now everyone I see the word empathy my brain automatically is like “you don’t feel that” I’m crying now and my brain is fucked.,0
"The classic teaching on The Four Thoughts That Turn the Mind from Samsara, has helped me greatly to maintain a deep motivation to practice over the past three decades.  I'll share the opening lines which HH the 17th Karmapa gave several years ago. It's my belief that if you use these four thoughts to assist you in maintaining momentum in your daily life as well as practices, this will propel you along the way more consistently. Here's a short except, and the rest can be engaged from the attached link.

The Seventeenth Karmapa began his teaching by naming the Four Thoughts That Turn the Mind from Samsara: (1) the precious human rebirth; (2) death and impermanence; (3) karma as cause and effect; and (4) the defects of samsara.

"Earlier today I was at a grocery store, which was crowded because it's the weekend. Sometimes I get thoughts about how other people might judge me about various aspects of my behaviour there. These thoughts link to an unpleasant tense feeling which I guess involves anxiety and maybe shame. Somehow I let go of these thoughts, somehow just letting them be and not attaching them to my concept of self in the way which brought up those feelings. I felt a notable relief and a greater presence in the external world.

It wasn't like the thoughts weren't mine. Though I also can't say they seemed very clearly mine. It was more like I wasn't giving them the kind of significance found when I'm learning about and figuring out reality. They were just thoughts which appeared, not any kind of truth which was important and which I have to concern myself with.

When I did this, the thoughts faded. It seems the grasping at them which comes from feeling they are significant intensifies and prolongs them.

I'm not 100% certain that this is an okay thing to do. Afterwards I was wondering if it was escapist. Sometimes it seems I experience concerns about myself via anxiety about other people judging me for activities which aren't very loving to myself. In the more distant past, I used to buy sweet baked goods regularly at a grocery store, and I was anxious about cashiers judging me for that. Those things are unhealthy, and it's like the part of me which didn't want them expressed itself that way. Simply letting go of such things could be a further dissociation from emotions and escapism. I already know how to do various kinds of escapism in my mind, and don't want to learn more. But maybe I should have some faith in how others view this, and maybe it is something better than the escapism I've learned to do on my own in my mind.",0
"I am a creative type with thoughts and ideas always flowing through my head. This type of thinking is necessary for what I do (game development) both for the coding end of things and the creative aspect. It is also an essential part of who I am. Over the past few years I have had several mental disorders get much worse; OCD, anxiety, and ADHD. I also have big problems with discipline and impulse control. I decided I might try to get into to meditation to calm down my mind and help take control of things, however, I have been scared of meditating ever since a few years ago when I read some of The Mind Illuminated and practiced it a bit.

After every time I would meditate, my mind would be completely silent. No thoughts, no ideas, nothing. Even if I tried to conjure something up, it was just like there was nothing to conjure. All I had was pure awareness. It really freaked me out because my mind is usually going a million miles an hour. Obviously a calm mind is desirable, but to the point that it takes away my ability to think and be creative like the way I used to, that would not be good. So is this a normal effect of meditation? Is this something that will in the end make me less imaginative and ambitious? Is this just a step in the process or the end goal?",0
"Hello, r/meditation, I’m a teenage girl who is starting to try meditation I’m on a five day streak with guided meditation and I’m proud of myself. But free trials on apps like “Balance” only last so long and I don’t have the funds to buy a month of guidance that’s why I’m here. Does anybody here know short guided meditation apps/playlists from around 3 to 5 minutes 10 I also fine but I don’t know whether I can hold my attention for that long at this stage. I really hope you guys can help as I use meditation to lower stress and anxiety. I have tried looking at r/audiomeditation. But find that those recordings are a bit to long for me

Thank you in advance",0
Late last night I was driving and an image of myself popped up in my head from a few years back. The intensity of this image in my head was something I had never experienced before. I have to say it was not good emotions tied a long to it. Shame and embarrassment were the feelings that came to mind. In this moment it was the first time that I had actually truly became disgusted with who I once was. For some reason I feel like this directly tied with meditation as I practice everyday. If any of you have experienced this I would like your opinion on what is happening. Thanks.,0

After I meditate I'm often left with this feeling that I need to let something go. I can feel it welling up inside of me and I always want to cry but I feel unable. I cry very infrequently but I feel like I'm holding on to something that I need to let go of. Any tips on how to allow myself to cry?,0
"If I were trying to meditate on sexual urges I guess it wouldn’t be totally strange to leak semen. However, it just kinda happened during my 30 minute meditation. I have been under a lot of stress lately and dealing with some shame from a traumatic event and usually when this happens I tend to go back to what comforts me as a safety net and that’s usually sexual feelings. During my meditation it was difficult for me to move this energy upward it felt like it was blocked. At the end of my meditation I noticed I had seminal fluid leaking. I’ve also  been practicing semen retention so I’m wondering if I just have too much energy stored right now and I’m not transmuting it correctly.",0
"I’ve been mediating for two months now, 30 mins at a time. I still can’t concentrate for more than 2 or 3 breaths before my mind starts to wander.

"As of last week I [25/M] decided to stick to meditating and have meditated for 5 consecutive days. I have started a course on Insight Timer for obsessive thinking which is 10-15 mins usually and listen to a love kindness meditate on youtube which is 15 mins. I have actually teared up several times during the love and kindness meditation. 

I’m hitting the gym and working out despite being tired or unmotivated and feel so great after. 

I have not yet fixed a sleeping schedule, but I’m trying my best. I’m sleeping at 1-2AM and waking up at 7:30AM and going back to bed from 10AM-1:30AM. I think this is important too. 

My diet has been very well, but as I am heavy lifting now I do think I need more bigger meals.

However, I still suffer from obsessive thinking. I’m fully aware that there is nothing wrong with me. Throughout the day I have moments of peace and calmness. But also get the occasional moment when I’m too much into my head. And keep obsessively thinking about the question “what if I’m suicidal” and I have seen a therapist about this and she said I show no signs of being suicidal and it’s simply my response mechanism for when I’m stressed. I have talked to friends, and family and everyone says the same thing. I also don’t feel suicidal, I don’t want to die or hurt myself. I actually wanna get rid of these thoughts. I don’t think of anything negative aside from this question. But my anxiety will produce chemicals throughout my body and my face (cheeks) will flair up and this gives me anxiety. 

Has anyone ever overcome this? Am I just too stuck in my head?",0
"Has helped me immensely. That is all.

Edit: thanks for all the upvotes and comments!",0
"I think I’m realizing that my entire life has been focused *against* meditation. I’ve always tried to remember song lyrics for times when I am bored or to try and keep me in a certain mindset while I perform activities. I recite things and cling to memories and try to recreate them in my head in order to remind myself of pain and truth. 

Recently this has been out of my control. Things just attack and invade my head. Everything is an echo. There’s never silence. I can’t look at something without connecting it to everything its related to. I can’t think about anything without turning over every single possibility imaginable. I can’t hear a word without trying to recall every important context of where I’ve heard this word. I can’t learn something new without feeling like I’ll be questioned on it. 

I feel like a slave to my own head and my own emotions. I sought darkness.. and now I feel like I am finally realizing the price I am paying.. Is there a specific type of meditation to help with this?",0
"Im fairly new to meditation, and was actually doing it while trying to have an astral projection.

I suddenly felt this overwhelming sensation that i was ok with death, and literally had a series of memories play in my mind from waaaay back to before i could walk (my first memory, havent revisited it in awhile and honestly forgot about it) and important memories of events in my life played out in chronological order.

It was extremely disturbing in all honesty and im wondering if this is common.

I probably could of just got up at any time but it was like i was in a trance and compelled to watch.

I also realized that i cant remember anything from 3rd grade...

And that my anxiety disorder, self consciousness and concentration issues began in 7th grade (anxiety), and 8th grade (concentration after a severe concussion and self consciousness after serious weight gain).

and depersonalization in 9th grade while in the shower in my old house.

depression last year (i knew this was recent but I was able to finally recall the events leading up to the trigger)

These things all skew perception and make it hard to pinpoint when they really started, but i remembered the exact moment tonight.

Maybe I can use this to really get to the root of my issues and fix them, though...

But by far one of the weirdest experiences of my life.

All this as im escaping alcoholism, im literally still feeling withdrawals.


Id like to add, this wasnt just ""memories"", it was VIVID. Not the typical greyed out old memories where you cant recall detail, it was truly bizzare and probably atypical.",0
"In Buddhism, there is what is called [Two truths doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine). Whatever blissful or mystical experiences one experiences, insights into things like non-self, impermanence, emptiness, they too just pass. Back to the breath. For I will surely get lost in thought again, and that is okay.

Mindfulness meditation leads to forgiveness. With healthy forgiveness and compassion, we do not excuse their behaviour. And we do so while maintaining our healthy boundaries - indeed, healthy boundaries likely result from states of forgiveness: for to reach these states requires forgiveness and compassion for yourself, knowing your own limits and imperfections, and what you deserve from a place of self-love. In fight or flight, I have felt anger. I have felt hatred. I have felt revenge. And when not mindful, it is projection. But, with mindfulness, they too are impermanent. They are not self. They are empty.

When I am not mindful, and that's a fuckload, split thinking and cognitive dissonance are some of my deeply engrained schemas - likely to manifest in and out of my mind until death. Subsequent anger after bouts of forgiveness can lead to perfectionsitic guilt, which regresses back to mind narratives of past and future - and that being my states of forgiveness weren't genuine. More and more, I hold my justified anger with mindfulness, compassion, and forgiveness. It is not mine. It is human emotions functioning, arising out of prior causes and conditions. And I see that forgiveness, like grief, is not linear - it is cyclic and unpredictable. It is not mine to control. And that's fucking cool.

For many, deep pain can be classified as 'trauma'. How bizarre it is to realise that the unconscious mind is in the body. Given that I am susceptible to intellectualise too much (probably these words, haha), when I found this out, it was like, ""what the fuck? Am I the last one to realise? Why didn't you all tell me?!"" How exciting that science is starting to see this more and more - The Body Keeps The Score indeed! And in my own experience, in states of mindfulness and focusing on Buddha's amazingggg three marks of existence, how this pain is not mine. It is inteergenrational trauma. It is unconscious scripts past down like emotional imprints. How curious.

With forgiveness, we are free of the past. We are free of the story between this person, largely fictitious, that reinforces the illusory self. With compassion, we see they did not choose their thoughts or their behaviour. They, too, are victims. And they project their pain onto you, however unconscious.

It is fear or love. Fear will never beat fear. Fear or love. Love. It is all Love.",0
"Like the title suggests, what should I exactly be doing when I meditate? Is it as easy as acknowledging your thoughts and letting them pass by you? How do you even acknowledge your thoughts without thinking about it? For example, would you just think I just thought about X or okay that’s nice but ignore it or just silently ignore it?

I have a feeling I’m missing an essential part about meditation.",0
"This is (roughly) how a friend summarized my explanation after I described the point of meditation.

Just like you train your brain to recognize dreams and gain control over them by repeatedly writing them down in dream diaries, meditation trains the brain to recognize when you live your life on autopilot, follow neurotic patterns, and so on, and puts you back into the driver seat.

It clearly doesn't capture all components of meditation, such as the improved focus, the reduced stress, the reminder that your desires and day-to-day struggles are not as important as you think, ... Yet I think it's quite a nice metaphor for this particular component. :)",0

"From what I've understood, mindfulness meditation is simply put emptying your mind and being aware while concentration meditation is focusing on something.

All the guides on mindfulness meditation say I should focus on my breathing, but isn't that considered concentration and not mindfulness?",0

What will it take to drop clinging to views? (*ditthupadana*)

Most western folks are taught to believe in things, so it is natural for one who is interested in Buddhism to take up many views that are associated with Buddhism.

Here some common beliefs:

1. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds.
2. There is an afterlife.
3. And there are ascetics and brahins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.

There are some good reasons to have these beliefs, and they are very common in Asia and part of the Religion of Buddhism. These are ordinary right views that are common, held by the leaders of society down to the lowest.

There is another way to view things, the Buddha’s noble way. Noble right view is based on wisdom and investigation, to make the mind pure noble and free from ordinary views.

Most Buddhist and other folks who practice anapanasati and/as vipassana generally are looking for leaving dissatisfaction and enter into satisfaction (dukkha-dukkha-niroda), they are looking for freedom. Yet clinging to any of the above views will keep the mind trapped in ordinary views.

So for those who aspire to be free from unsatisfactory ness, What will it take to give up these ordinary common views and enter into Noble right view? What would convince you that anatta is real and can not be reborn? The Pali Cannon is not the infallible word of Buddha and is poorly teranslated? That it has been messed with by ordinary folks.

It boils down to the same thing: *Tell us what your price is. Where your line is drawn? Your conditions? What will it take to give up views?*

"I went in 55 minutes straight.
My biggest struggle was lowering my expectations of what was to come.
And I would say right around the last ten minutes I finally let go and let it all in.

Meaning I stoped trying so hard.
The whole time I could feel it.
My ego..thinking it could just try hard and get their. And that wasn't the case.

Once I stoped refusing to relax and and trying to navigate something or some space I truly don't know. I broke threw. But to what I'm not sure. The visuals weren't there. But this time I could feel something trying to heal me.
More specifically in my brain.
I could feel the vanes in my brain...
And they didn't feel damaged...I mean what would I know from my experiences.
But this time felt real like my energy was drawn to this point in my head and I felt like blood was finally circulating freely threw it and with a lot of power.

Here is a bit of my background on dmt before I finish...
I once met this lady when I broke threw under the blood moon this year.
It was a tragic week for me but I still decided to break threw ( I'm not the one to take a bad experience as bad their all just experiences) when I broke threw I was held by the most beautiful women warrior I've ever met. She was so beautiful I couldn't stand to look for more then a few seconds and incould tell she was a warrior but that explanation is for another time
...my little brain couldn't comprehend her, she closed my eyes and told me to relax and gave me all of the answers I ever needed up until that point. If you guys wanna know more I'll make a video and post it.

But the point being I've been receiving a deep love from something and I think it's her. Before my meditating ended tonight I felt my third eye Beginning to calm down and close and the vanes and space in my brain felt extremely clear, then I heard I love you. Now normally I have thoughts on top of thoughts in the beginning of my sessions. I'm a deep thinker and a quick one at that I also disassociate on a healthy level. So im aware of why and what I'm thinking and the tone and feeling. But this....This was another entitiy entirely and it felt like her...from my DMT trip, words escape me and I wish I could express this better but I know deep down she's been following me, 

PS side not : I stoped pulling tarot cards because I kept getting signs of her and my ex girlfriend popping up in the reading. I've literally pulled the same cards for weeks, and I'm not to good at there interpretation of them. So I finally gave in and up and couldn't handle the truth..which was hard to handle and frustrating because I didn't know how to reach the entity on the other side with out DMT or make amends with someone who we equally didn't want to see me as much as I didn't want to see her anymore....so those I began to search for healing and exploration to how we could meet and how I could forgive myself and ex girl. 
 And im shocked to say I'm not sure if life is much under our control even though we have choices that make us feel free I don't think we are to much free of how we really feel on the inside...only how we plan to get there..sorry if that sounds dark I just think freedom is 50% reality and the other 50 is something big the soul ... something I really need to get to know 

Thanks for reading ❤️🖤",0
"I really need to get this off my chest or my mind rather, it may seem silly, but for a long long time now. I've had a serious problem that has led to my self-help journey. This problem is a problem of not visual concentration because I have 20/20 vision, it is mental concentration. This may seem really ridiculous and it is to me as I write it out, but it's a mental problem of being unable to fully focus on an image as a whole like on a screen or a picture, drawing, art, etc. It started with anime for some reason, I guess it was something so foreign that I guess I couldn't understand it, I needed to know why they drew people or told stories the way they did. I needed to understand shapes and line work and the importance of that and what it means chemically, scientifically, culturally and other shit. Low and behold I realized I was just overthinking like an idiot. Discovered Sadhguru about overthinking and instantly stopped. I'm better now, but this for some reason has led me to search for something more for some reason, like I wanted to know the true meaning behind everything. I was and a little bit still am in fear of not enjoying things to their fullest, so in order to do that, I took things apart in order to find some info or evidence that would allow me to truly appreciate it in its highest form. I would focus on things like the shape of the hair, why is it so unorderly I guess, not fixed; in everything I did this. This problem came in stuff like animated movies, movies, and art in general. idk why, but i guess i needed to understand all to be all. Now I can't even focus on an image as a whole like in the present moment. It doesn't drive me nuts, but it empairs me fully enjoying something in the present. Sorry for a long story.",0
"hi, thanks for helping

1- how to forgive people who hurt you, been nasty (without any reason), bullied you

2-how to forgive life for being so unfair

3-how to forgive life for giving more to people who are 'bad', specifically people who has done bad stuff to me

4-how to forgive myself for a single past mistake, knowing that i am a perfectionist and really can't stand hurting anyone, or annoying them, etc.

a bit of background

concerning others: toxic household, bullied at school, rejected ALTHOUGH i was nice, modest, humble, physically well, , with an interesting life etc. teachers also unfair and nasty.

(for many reasons, my environment was bad and i didn't have an alternative for it)

concerning me: i uesd to be close with my mum and we'd argue. during the argument, she became cold and very distand, and it drove me crazy, which lead to bigger arguments. always felt guilty, didn't feel relieved until we made piece.

so i carry some guilt almost all the time. being bullied is a reason to this. i feel like i owe people something, i feel like i should please please etc.

i don't really care about people in my past, i hold no grudge against them but i definitely have an overall bitterness feeling. it affects how i interact with people currently.  it affects me as i feel i shouldn't be successful because people won't like me or will be threatened. i feel i shouldn't take care of myself because people won't like me. and it's true, when i used to be really smarter, more mature, than people of my age, and naturally gifted in many things (looks, money, voice, memory, academic abilities etc), i've NEVER had any appreciation except maybe a bit from my mum and a very few dear teachers. i was fought against, made fun of, people tried to bring me down, etc. so, i feel like if i let people be better than me, i get more peace of mind (it's true, believe it or not... until uni. at uni people changed and they ""like"" successful people who put effort in looks and studies and hobbies. but now it's too late, what's done is done and i feel like i want to be ""nobody"" so that i get no obstacles and hate and jealousy etc etc.

how can i get past everything i've been through? is there any way to forget everything related to past (especially knowing i have a very very good memory)?

second, i've done something quite awful during a long mental breakdown (not just months). a friend of mine, he hurt me, and i've done stuff in reaction to what he's done, that are not ethical. he doesn't know but if he did, he would be very hurt (understandable). i also feel i shouldn't be friends with him and shouldn't be cool and fun to be around with him because i'd be giving him a wrong insight about me . So yeah. not sure how to move forward. i think about it every single day. not sure how to be done with this. in addition to the guilt feeling i mentioned before, i now feel guilty because of this. it worsens the feeling that i don't deserve to be successful, pretty, etc etc.

any tip, advice, insight, similar experience is welcome.

p.s.: i always notice that ""good"", genuine people have a life that's shittiest than those who are not that good. it's not a coincidence, i'm talking about loads of people. anyone can explain ? :(",0

I was planning on buying dandapani's new course called unwavering focus, which you can purchase from the app. I was wondering how is that different from the online course he has. Also, if I am just looking to increase concentration should I buy the meditation course as well or just stick with unwavering focus because as a student $249 is a lot.

I sometimes use tarot cards (just for fun) and I’ll experience the same thing while I’m picking out the cards; however, unlike when I’m meditating, the images are stronger and more concrete, if that makes sense?

"Long story short, i had a lot of friends in middle school and was quite outgoing(still a quiet kid but i could at least make new friends and the majority of people liked me) . In high school we moved to a new town and i struggled to make friends there. I became very lonely throughout my high school career and lost my social skills. I am now in my senior year. Recently i have decided to work on getting over my social anxiety. I tried to be more fearless and be myself more. I've had good days but as soon as i start thinking about how well it is going, i immediately start overthinking and relapsing.

An old friend of mine and the only one i still have contact with said that his nieces friend needed a date for her prom. I decided to say yes because it could be a great opportunity to work om my social skills. Yesterday, me and thus girl went to go drink a coffee and get to know one another and it was really awkward. I just couldn't use the social skills that i have been working on for the past few months. I am so stressed now and i cant stop thinking about it and literally can't think about anything else besides how bad the date went and the fact that i have to go to prom with her on tuesday. I know this isn't evem so bad and that the logical thing to do would be to be more aware of these anxious thoughts and learn from them and from my mistakes i made during the date but i just cant escape the thought. Even ehen i was with my two friends today, i just sat there quietly because i could not enjoy myself in the moment as i usually do and kept thinking about that date. I have been having this knot feeling in my stomach that hasnt stopped. Even when i meditate, i cant stop thinking about it. I try to just observe the thought but i just cant.

"It’s really hard for me to let go of anger. I want vengeance. I want to get even. I want those who have hurt me to also hurt. I want people to get what they deserve. I have a lot of hate in my heart. 

I know this isn’t helpful. On paper I have a relatively easy time rationalizing it. I just can’t seem to believe it. I can tell it to myself but the feelings don’t dissipate. I can’t quite grasp the concept that if person A wrongs me for selfish reasons, that they are somehow worse off and I am somehow better off. Maybe in the long run. But I feel like I need to justify it. 

I have used pain a lot to better myself. Every time I was hurt I would try and do something productive or successful to be better and drive forward. Then I got good at it. I would sometimes intentionally hurt myself since it provided a lot of fuel. Eventually I burnt out. But I’m realizing the hate is still there. It was once fire but now has turned to venom and poison.

"Hi all.  I hope your having a pleasant and mindful day. 😌

I've been going through some tough emotions lately, and although my normal breath focused meditation is helping directly somewhat, I think it potentially will help me more by making me realize how low my self-confidence is.  I've always been aware of my low self confidence, but I'm now becoming more aware of how it brings me to these negative emotional states in the first place.

Anyway, I'm looking for recommendations of some of your favorite loving kindness guided meditations with a focus on being kinder and more loving to yourself.

And boy I wish I could really tell you In full detail but most words escape me. It all kind of happened at once. Beautiful colors and spaces within spaces. They only lasted a few moments. 
My heart knew I wasn't ready to go completely all of the way. Though my ego was pushing really hard with each heart beat that thumped I grew closer but I still harbor feelings against people I don't want to carry with me to where ever my spirit is breaking threw too

I have a history of anger and I can hold a grudge like an elephant.
So instead of going all of the way my instinct put on the breaks. My mind set believes I don't hold the pieces of peace yet but now that I have seen.. I know what's up..and I know what I have to do. 
And I'm going to have a burning session soon to free up what ever I can't reach like a deep tissue ache in my muscles that needs a professional. I just want to be safe so I can do what I came to do with no more distractions 😉

"“Sitting meditation is not, as is often supposed, a spiritual ‘exercise’, a practice followed for some ulterior object. From a Buddhist standpoint, it is simply the proper way to sit, and it seems perfectly natural to remain sitting so long as there is nothing else to be done, and so long as one is not consumed with nervous agitation. To the restless temperament of the West, sitting meditation may seem to be an unpleasant discipline, because we do not seem to be able to sit ‘just to sit’ without qualms of conscience, without feeling that we ought to be doing something more important to justify our existence. To propitiate this restless conscience, sitting meditation must therefore be regarded as an exercise, a discipline with an ulterior motive.

EDIT:  I kind of knew this would blow up and I'd trigger people, just like walking into a Christian subreddit and saying there is no God.  I honestly support everyone's efforts to change their lives in a positive way, I just wanted to spark some discussion and maybe find an reason why I should try it again for the umpteempth time.

EDIT:  if I get run off this sub by angry meditators it will just prove my point lol",0

"For years I've adopted the common practice of ""catching"" myself thinking into the past or the future; utilizing the idea that time is a mind-derived concept. I wanted to create a visualization that could act as a reminder to help bring me back to the present moment, so I started to visualize a book. The left side of the book would designate the past while the right side of the book would represent the future. Ideally, I would exist at the binding of the book or at a single word of a page; this acting as the present moment.

As I held this visualization, it dawned on me that this representation may actually cause an identification with time. I'm saying ""I recognize past and future don't exist"" but at the same time creating its existence by visual representation. This realization created a shift in my perception; by viewing time as linear in this way, I hadn't fully let go of the hold time had on my life.

I'm finding it hard to put into words, but in meditative practice it may feel something like this:

* *""I've caught myself anxious about the future, therefor I will bring myself back to the present moment""*

vs.

* *""I've caught my mind perceiving the concept of future. I recognize this is an illusion of the mind and I accept that this present moment is all that exists""*

This was a meaningful shift to me so I'm hoping it may provide value to others. If anyone can elaborate on this idea I would love to hear it!",0

"Hello!

I've been meditating here and there for the past month. I hadn't noticed much of a difference in my mindset so I decided to take a more disciplined approach and make it a daily practice. I've meditated every day this week and the past two days ran into an interesting problem I didn't anticipate.

How the hell do you meditate when you just don't want to?

I power through the impulse saying ""To hell with it. Go make some coffee."" I set a timer. I lie down. I breathe. I try not to try too hard and just allow it to happen. Then the timer goes off yet I never quite got into the zone.

I learned that consistency is of the utmost importance when building a new habit two years ago when I got back into working out. Even when I really didn't want to do anything physical at all I still tried. Twenty push ups are better than zero push ups. Beyond building the habit there was definite benefit in just the attempt itself.

Aside from building or maintaining the habit, do you find benefit in the mere attempt at meditation? How does it feel to simply go through the motions?",0

I do not really believe in all the ""energy"" stuffs. Thank you.

"Hello. Does anyone have the same problem as me? When I graduated from high school, I started to take meditation seriously. I felt some of the greatest joys and stillness during that period of my life. I remember going for walks at 11pm during winter and immersing myself in what seemed to be a distant world. However, when I started to work, take classes, and worry about what I would do with my life (parents would remind me that I have to make my own life), I stopped meditating. I recently realized why I stopped. When I meditate, my mind feels free and untethered. However, my mind eventually remembers the work, the school, the crossroads that I'm at as an adult and all of my social anxieties. I realized that that process of ""coming back"" to reality after meditation is painful. I know that the original Pali Canon recommended people into meditation to live a life in seclusion and in nature and I want to do that, but I live near D.C. in an urbanized area. For those like me, what do you do? I wish that there were more natural spaces scattered throughout my community to sit in.",0
"Staying present during formal practice is hard. But getting yourself to stay present throughout the day is even harder given all the distractions around us. What are some ways you stay present throughout the day? Or other ways to remind yourself to be in the “here and now”.

"Hello all,

Recently I’ve been probing into meditation and I wanted to get advice on an experience I’ve been having. I’ve been trying to do some mindfulness meditation every once and a while when I need to walk an appreciable distance in my day to day life. When I try to just listen to my sensory perceptions, however, I can get into this trance like state that feels rather lonely and disturbing. It is a rather difficult emotional experience to explain but I’ll do my best to draw a picture. When I try to just notice sounds, sights, smells, etc. for what they are, i can’t help but feel like reality is, for lack of a better word, naked. I think it’s a similar feeling that would occur if one were to watch an animal body decompose or watch hundreds of insect larvae hatch from a breeding ground - this kind of detached observation of something vulgar, intensely interested in itself, and just inevitably sort of there. I know I probably already sound very pretentious, but I’ll risk sounding even more so by saying that the “thereness” of the world overwhelms me, leaving me feel both totally isolated as an observer of things and in a trance because of how inescapable this all feels. It’s like being stuck in a bad situation for too long, even if you struggled at the beginning eventually you just accept the place you’re in with a detached, unpleasant indifference. 

Certainly I can see someone telling me that it isn’t reality saying these things to me, but what I with my preconceptions on existence (ie that it’s vulgar, overwhelming, etc) am saying to myself, but I can’t seem to help it; as much as I try to unravel the thread further, there doesn’t seem to be a level of experience beyond this kind of state where things do nothing but nakedly exist. 

Is there any sort of mental space I should try to get myself into before I try mindfulness, or anything I may be doing wrong? Because listening to the world as I know how to do clearly doesn’t work. I’ve heard that meditative practices often try to transcend one’s sense of self for pure presence in the moment - based on my (admittedly few) experiences, that sounds really dreadful to me, and I can’t conceptualize a way in which that would be something worth working towards.",0
"So I normally don't share my experience. I have a I firm belief what we go threw can be often individual. But I'm learning slowly otherwise to still try and share.

I have been practicing meditating for over five or six years now. Slowly picking up the pace as time passed and life became more difficult 💔. 

I normally had a basic time. Especially over the past three years. Ya know how it goes. You learn to let go and build on yourself.
It's all been a blast, tones of tears plenty of smiles and a few cries that I never knew my heart was holding on too. Dad issues bad relationships and what ever I neglected along the way. I've also grown adept to my own energy 

But I've come to the big punch.
My anger, and lack of love. 

Now  to give you a hint most of my relationships friendship or love ship. Have been heavley karmic, and it finally dawned on me I'm the oldest male still around in my family ( grandfather dead. Dad miss placed, uncle is to far gone in his brain due to drugs to know what's up from down) I'm the one people come to for a lot. It's no burden though. But I started to notice the lack of true significant others ( love ) in my family's lineage. Now I've over looked this several times...until today. 
a lot of pieces fell together kind of all at once like when you don't know the answer to a question on a test so you skip it and your forced to come back because you want a 100% on this thing we call life.. 

to not lose your attention I'll wrap this up quick and simple . I decided to ask myself and what ever good spirits that follow my life and my family's life what's the deal with my anger why does my family struggle with love, I mean it's deep man real deep, and it's even deeper for the woman in my family, mom divorced two and the third died of a heart attack at a really early age. Dude was an athlete who's family had no prior history just to give you a taste. Me my luck's been a bit better but to no avail still kinda the same just no actual death

So I said screw it I need to know.
And with deep affirmation I dove deep.
Now I'm able to meditate for about an hour before my (will) realizes we have other stuff to do, so here is the best part... 
I asked the same question over and over again why am I angry.. I need the answer was always the under thought as well ..not want or please.. simply keeping the vibe I know the answer is here some where.

I was basically on the hunt for the White rabbit in my life that always got away. And with a steady fast heart Im sure I came into contact with something epic. 
While pushing my energy to poor from my body...which was kinda foolish with out the right protection I might add I eventually was pushed from the right side of my body.

Now I know the difference between your body flinching during meditation and being pushed.

The only problem is I didn't have time to retrain my focus.. remember I'm only adept to this.

The next stage was quick I felt warm and all of my energy I had been collecting around my body swopped away super quick.
Now normally I get super warm at the beginning of my meditating which makes sense to me because I'm coming into focus.
I eventually normalize and get used to the heat. 

Not knowing how to handle it I called for friends and family living and none living to help aid in a quick recovery so I could bounce back and chase what ever had done this to me  so it could do not do it again. Because it didn't feel right or justified..
I came to the conclusion a true friendly entity comes in peace not but force. It's smooth and consenting like a puzzle piece that most go to it's place by design.

After a some what of a quick recovery from imagery and breathing techniques brought threw a thought cycle I was normalized again and feeling my flow. 

I hauleted my rage for I am not the one to be pushed.
And thought back to what I was thinking before this had occurred..ya k ow action reaction things don't happen for no real reason in my life 

I remember thinking I would die to help my family figure this out I would give up myself to know what I can do to help my family and ancestors be stronger for the past and Future *and that's when it came*

So with a good eye on what I wanted I restrained myself from over reacting.
I've heard succubus will just consume more energy from you if you keep trying to dish out to attack, ive heard from others that they had to change the emotions of the attack to throw them off to do real damage..but I wanted to not fight with rage just peace.
 
I've learned from the repercussions of war with real people and I can only imagine what it's like to fight on an astral plane. The spiritual suffering after has to be insane.

So I always assure in this mantra of peace
( I do not wish to make energy to harm damage or cause pain, if you stay you will be transformed by my love and will to live)


I know what it's like to hunger threw anger and other negative emotions. 

So I'd rather not hurt anything that's just trying to survive. 
And it worked I slowly came back to full intense body vibe and flow and after a swift check of my surroundings I kept hearing small sounds all over my room I never hear much before while meditating. But this time was different it was my first time trying binureal beats 
Now normally I can pick up on this stuff because I'm not wearing headphones , it's ether the (A/C or my cat) and it definitely wasn't the A/C Becuase I couldn't hear or feel it and I had not heard my cat actually messing around 
...in fact he came back into the room about two minutes after I was done
And my cats a dick when he wants to be childish he goes all out..now me and my cat are super close and cool like we talk to each other. Even though it's just a bunch of loud meows and me just asking simple obvious questions he only does it primarily with me, so it's comforting to so the least. I came to the conclusion what ever it was had to be messing with the posters on my Walls...I have a bunch that aren't properly taped down. 

This may sound insane I know ..so I did hesitate to share and I'm really glad you read this. I'm going to have to make some  protective moves from here on out so I don't end up like Alice I wonderland and I'll let you guys know how my family's anger works out from here.

I have a feeling it's only just getting started.",0
"While I’m on my second 5 minute meditation I see blue orbs/disc getting smaller, and getting larger as time goes. I looked up what the blue disc or one can be, and I came across something called a blue pearl. If I’m not mistaking, when you see the blue pearl it means you either see God, your soul in this universe, or it’s your eyes being closed so long that your eyes retinas makes this possible. Not being egotistical about it, I just want to know the true meaning behind it, thanks :)",0

"I direct my attention to a particular muscle (I feel slight tingles), and subsequently when I consciously relax that muscle (heavy tingles). 

1) does anyone experience this
2) what’s happening here physiologically? 

Also, How does that translate when this attention is then shifted to the brain? My intuition is that you could direct blood flow and/or electrical activity to specific parts of your brain and so presumably giving the frontal lobe more attention may enhance executive functioning.

What do you guys think? any research on this is much appreciated",0

"I’ve been meditating daily for the past 2 months now. I use Headspace as my meditation app of choice. A month ago I went through a breakup and I’ve been heartbroken ever since and I find meditation very helpful. 

Ever since the breakup, I started meditating even more, a minimum of 2 to 5 times daily instead of once everyday when I started out. It definitely helps me with thoughts about my relationship. 

Though, only recently that I started feeling my heartbeat. It’s the same kind of feeling you would feel while going on a run or while you’re nervous. 

At first, I thought that it was because of the breakup, because when I close my eyes, I start to feel it. I tried putting my hand on my chest but I don’t feel anything. It’s weird because I thought my heart beats faster just like when I run, you know when you run and your heart beats fast, you can feel it with your hand. In my chest, I feel like it goes faster but I don’t feel anything with my hand. 

I wonder if anyone feels this also. I also would like to mention that I feel so much calmer after meditating, it puts me in a very calm enjoyable state. I don’t know if that’s the reason behind it, meaning I’m just more in tune with my body.",0

"Anyone’s rumination and intrusive thinking worse on CBD because it causes lack of motivation and discipline?!

I’ve been taking 15 mg full spectrum CBD oil capsules (with low THC) 1-2/day. I’ve noticed it calms my PTSD startle responses in public but it also makes me become more apathetic, unmotivated, and lazier. I notice I have less discipline to practice meditation and stop myself from ruminating and thinking of intrusive thoughts. My mind keeps resisting the CBD calmness and I keep ruminating non stop. This is my second day of migraines and I think it’s because of the nonstop ruminating. I think the CBD is making this worse. I also wonder if my mind is ruminating even more with cbd because it is not used to the calmness and is trying to cause mental distress to go back to that fight or flight State I am used to as a form of self sabotage (I keep thinking about distressing memories). I also notice CBD oil makes it harder for me to process my emotions as it has a numbing effect. Maybe I am taking too much?",0

This morning I wake up and to my pleasure I find that both nostrils are functioning perfectly! Wonderful!

Within moments after sitting up, my nose starts running and then I start sneezing uncontrollably for at least a couple minutes. Reset the timer.

I will not waiver. Taking a small piece of tissue paper I push it up one nostril, apparently the sinuses decided it's  time to drain the swamp,  and each time I need to breathe in I pull out that other nostril  with my fingers.

"Before the interview, I was waiting at ths lobby and felt nervous, but decided to pay mindful attention to the surroundings and notice the people coming to work instead, and anxiety subsided.

Although, when I got called in to do a written test as the first stage of the interview, I kind got lost in thought when planning and writing the essay, and barely made the time limit. 

This leads me to the question: what does being mindful in the context of doing a writing task or task that involves thinking mean? If you become so absorbed in the task that you lose track/awareness of the physical surroundings, is that comsidered as being mindful? Are you supposed to become ""swallowed up"" by the task? To illustrate, I am typimg this on the train, and while typing this I was not aware of the passing of stops, and before I knew it it was my stop. Does mindfulness mean being aware of how the train is stopping at every station while I type this, or does mindfulness include being so absorbed in a task until you block out everything else?

EDIT: I guess the gist of it is: if you focus completely on doing one thing to the extent of blocking out everything else, such as typing this post on my phone while on the train, to the extemt that I was not aware of the passing of stops - does that count as being mindful?",0
"The title is a more ""pretty"" way of saying that when I meditate I will eventually hit a point where there's a sensation in my finger tips.

This feeling starts to envelope my body from my spine and can sometimes feel frightening, but also very warm and comforting. Then I'm left sitting there with what feels like no body just watching my thoughts roll by. Some of which can be a bit anxious, and I can sometimes feed into them but I do my best to accept and welcome them and back into this weird void I go. And I enjoy it. It's something magically relaxing and somewhat idk emotional or informational?

"Yesterday I went to a local Buddhist meditation group after a few months of not attending. I have been struggling a bit mentally, and decided to go as I didn't have that much going on. Honestly it was more for the community aspect than the teachings. Everyone there has at least 30 years on me, so I get a cool perspective.

Anyway after the meditation when I open my eyes my ears started ringing very loudly and my vision fogged up. It was similar to a head rush (I get them a lot) but I was sitting down the whole time. I had just drank 2 glasses of water so I knew it wasn't dehydration. It didn't come with any alternative thoughts or feelings that stood out, which has happened to me with before. The ear ringing was extremely loud, louder than everyone in the room. I've also been having a ton of ear ringing in general. 

I went over to my friends house after the and gave his mom a hug. She said ""You are sad, why are you sad?""

I sorta just laughed it off and said ""I didn't know I was sad."" I had a dream a while back where my girlfriend told me that I have a big ball of sadness, and this reminded me of it. But compared to how my mood has been the past few weeks I was in a good mood. 

Anyway that is just some background information, my main reason for posting this is to get some different opinions on this ringing and dizziness. I don't know what to think of it. Thanks",0

So,* ***Osho Prem Nida****is like a nest that nurtures love &amp;joy, nourishes the soul &amp; rejuvenates the body.*  *It is a place of* divine potential for sentient experience, ultimate happiness, and deep contentment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Location** \- 

 Osho Prem Nida, an ashram in the lap of nature, is located in the village Daluwala within limits of Rajaji Nation Park between Roorkee &amp; Haridwar ( Uttrakhand). Amidst the greenery &amp; jungle, the ashram is spread over 32 acres.OshoPremNida was inaugurated on 25 July 2010 on the day of Gurupurnima and the wilderness of nature has been preserved while designing the ashram.

&amp;#x200B;

**Natural Beauty-**

The ashram is surrounded by Shivalik ranges. The serene environment of the ashram has calmness of the trees, the fragrance of flowers, chirping of birds and whistling winds. During clear nights its seems that stars are bestowing all their coolness on the Ashram. Proximity to Ganga also provides a lot of spiritual energy which helps in meditation energizing mind and body. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Nature heals and soothes-**

  

Being in nature reduces anger, fear, depression, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only provides better emotional strength, but it also contributes to the physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones. In the long run, it reduces mortality.

***""Nature is fuel for the soul, ""*** says Richard Ryan

&amp;#x200B;

**Meditation in Nature -** 

 The abundance of positive energy in nature removes negativity from the mind &amp; body. The awareness of natural beauty is a step towards egolessness.  Raw greenery, Bamboo trees, wildflowers bring the calmness of thoughts and revitalizes the body- such undisturbed wilderness makes it a perfect getaway for mystical experiences.

Meditating in nature is not just good for mind, body &amp; soul it is also good for plants &amp; animals. They are more healthy and peaceful. 

It has been experienced by Mahavir- “***By meditating in nature we connect, pray and communicate with trees , plants, animals, birds, crystal &amp; water, etc.”***

The proximity of the river Ganga also brings divine effect. The sound of water also has a tranquilizing effect on the mind. Ganga has been considered sacred for the very simple reason that the meditation has been done by many saints on the banks of this holy river. The water gets energized due to the power of meditation and drinking that water makes us peaceful.

Water molecules react differently on being exposed to positive or negative thoughts, so we can appreciate the fact that as our bodies are 70% water our thoughts and emotion will play a big role in our health and wellbeing.",0
"I’ve been trying to practice meditation, and I’m finding it to be extremely frustrating as opposed to calming. I try to focus on something such as my breathing and to just allow thoughts to enter and leave without paying much attention, but my mind just becomes agitated and unable to focus. It feels impossible for me to make any progress, and if anything, my failing to do so just  increase negative feelings. I’m not doing this to find or obtain anything, just to sit and breathe and be present, but I cannot for the life of me practice anything remotely close to that. 

I deal with a lot of anxiety and irritability, so I could certainly benefit from the practice, but it feels like I don’t have the capability to do so, which only serves to amplify the anxiety/irritability. I usually feel worse after trying to meditate than before.",0

"Hello. I consider myself very lucky to live near the beach. I try my best to walk on the beach to observe, listen, meditate and stretch a few times a week. Lately I’ve been pausing and watching more particularly at sunset or early in the morning calm. I started recording the landscapes to watch and listen to them in my free time. They help me relax during breaks at work or go to sleep. It’s simple, I just capture the stillness of the moment and the waves/ landscape are perfect white noise to ease the mind. I put the videos online, don’t think it’s for everyone - but maybe it’ll help y’all find stillness.

"After attending a TM course I've been doing it for more than a month and so far my life has improved in more ways than one. I realise I might have achieved it with a different, cheaper to learn technique but as a newbie to serious meditation I'm satisfied with it anyway.

In recent months I got familar with more types of meditation through the internet and friends alike. They all seem interesting and benefitial in some way so I would like to try them in the future at some point.

How would I go about trying them some time later not to abandon TM? I know i can't propably do more than one at the same time but would it be ok If I changed it up for Vipassana or Mindfullness for at least a moth so I could at least check what these techniques are about?",0
"Recently I’ve been going through a life transition (aren’t we always???) and have fallen out of my meditation practice when I’ve needed it the most. I’ve been trying to get back into it, but the mental noise has been so opaque that I can’t focus on my breath for more than five seconds without getting distracted. I used to be able to go 20 minutes or so in a state of meditation, now that seems insurmountable. Any advice on how to get back into my mindfulness practice?",0
"Hey all,

I'm new to meditation practice (a few weeks), but I have been meditating most evenings before bed and have been able to really reach a meditative state for at least part of the meditation. It's a pretty awesome feeling and im keen to continue and build on my practice. 

Last night I listened to a guided healing mediation by Michael Sealey on YouTube. I listened to it with headphones in, because my partner was sleeping next to me and didn't feel like meditating. I fell asleep before the meditation ended. 

I had the most intense, visual dream of my ex boyfriend. We dated for 5 years, from age 19-24 (relevant). In my dream we were reconnecting and talking about what has happened in each other's life since we broke up. We hugged very intensely and I told him about my life. It was amiable.  Note that I have zero contact with my ex, he lives across the country now and we don't have each other on social media. 

While my current partner is at work he texts me ""I had a really weird dream about your ex boyfriend. I was having visions of you except younger, with black hair and kinda emo. You guys were hugging and I felt sad and jealous in the dream"". It's true that I did look ""kind of emo"" in my early 20s (and had black hair), and he hasn't seen many pictures of me from that time. 

I have to note that my current partner and I live in Ontario, and I grew up in Alberta (where my ex lives). There's zero chance that my partner has seen photos of my ex or has mutual friends etc. He's not someone I talk about a lot so it is random for him to have a dream of him. 

Is this a phenomenon that anyone is familiar with?  

I never forgave my ex for a lot of things that he did to me (infidelity, lying, manipulation).  I feel that my repressed subconscious wants me to forgive him. Tips? Thoughts? Opinions? Have you experienced something similar?",0
How do you end your meditations? I've been meditating for about a month and find that I get particularly anxious about meditating beyond the time I've set aside. Using a standard timer is harsh and quite unpleasant but I need some way of trusting that I'm going to reengage with the world at am appropriate time. Suggestions?,0
So right now I meditate 25 minutes in the morning and 25 before bed.  My dilemma is that I’m not very consistent meditating in the evening.  Would meditating 50 minutes in the morning be better if it means I’m more consistent? And would jumping from 25 minutes to 50 minutes be too much?,0
"Since I meditated yesterday I see a massive crack over my vision  that consist of colors that change rapidly, when I focus on it it just goes a bit more to the left and shortly after focusing it goes back to the middle. It's fascinating but really annoying. I can't really see what I am writing because that crack is going over the letters I am typing. It just appeared 14 hours after meditating while I was on my phone.",0

"Hello /r/meditation,

I'm looking for guided imagery or other meditative practice that would focus on cultivating and experiencing an emotion.

I know an example of such guided imagery where you have a trigger that would make you build the emotion up, and then you let it go as soon as the trigger is no more there.

I would love to learn about similar techniques if anybody can advise on it",0

"I’ve been trying to meditate on and off for around two years, never getting further than a streak of a week or two of daily practice. I’m currently using the Headspace app, even though I find the narrator’s voice unpleasant, because at least it’s very simple.  
 
Everything I read and hear about meditation seems to say the easiest place to start is to focus on your breathing. I don’t under how to do this, though. I can’t focus on something with no words. As in, if I’m trying to put my focus onto my breathing, or for that matter instrumental music or something visual, my inner monologue is still running. Not always in a bad way, but obviously it’s not great when trying to meditate. The Headspace instructions talk about “observing your thoughts and letting them go” but although I can consciously think “that was a thought, I don’t need to dwell on it,” my brain moves on to a different thought, rather than to even a second of wordlessness. I don’t know how my brain can even exist without words to be honest - there isn’t a second of my life where words aren’t going through my mind. 

I’m not spiritual, so mantras don’t appeal to me (I’m also not a fan of affirmations), and have quite bad anxiety; the aim is to get to a point where I don’t overthink so much and can more easily distance myself from what I worry about.",0
"Hi guys, I am going to start going on the path of enlightenment. I just need to ask a few questions before I get started. 

I have ADHD, would that make meditation more harder for me? 

Does being on medication for ADHD like adderall bad or good for your path of enlightenment? 

Do you breath in through your nose and out of your mouth?

I have hearing aids, so when I'm not wearing them I can barely like hear anything. So I was wondering if I should meditate in silence or do it while listening to meditation musics?

I'm also wondering if there is any other sites or music that can help me tune into the universal energies more and more. 

And one last thing, I used to smoke weed daily but now its occasionally. Does weed messes up your enlightenment? And is it okay to meditate when you're high?

Thank you, any help is greatly appreciated.

Im also going to meditate while lying down since I find it more comfortable.",0
"I had a really rough day today. Don't need to get into it but work was a bitch and my personal life threw a curveball at me.

I got home feeling angry and frustrated, and normally my go-to stress reliever is weed (see username) but instead I decided to take a different approach.

Now I'm no stranger to meditation, and I actually try and do it every day, and have been for a decent chunk of time now. But I've only recently actually tried to apply the Wim Hof breathing method into my arsenal as well. Never tried the cold shower part before though.

I tried the cold shower today, and let me tell you it was the greatest damn shower I've ever taken. I hate the cold. I suck it up because there's no reason to complain about it, but I still hate it.

For me to be able to step into a freezing cold shower and go from ""OHMYGODTHISFUCKINGSUCKS"" to ""you know, I like this a lot"" in less than 30 seconds is nothing short of a miracle. I finished my shower and stepped out feeling like a new man. 

I can't believe how long it has taken me to finally try this, but now I'm going to do everything I can to incorporate the shower into my daily routine as well. I feel as good and confident now as I really ever do, not to mention the health benefits associated with taking colder showers. 

TL;DR - Cold shower made me happy instead of more angry.",0

"Hi everyone!

I have dabbled on and off over the years with meditation and recently I have found new level of awareness and commitment to the practice.  (for me it's been the app headspace that's helped tremendously, something about it just clicks for me)

I am on a one week streak and want to keep at it.  But one thing derails me a little bit at times.... My cats.  I love them so much! They've been a great help in the past when struggling with depression.  They're always there to rub against me, fwop on my lap, one even drools when I give him big pets.  

I recently realized they're a great practice in being mindful, they bring my awareness to the moment and help keep my mind clear when distracted with anxious thoughts.  However, sometimes when meditating, they become the distraction.  I do my best to include their presence as a part of my meditation (being aware of my surroundings) .  But there are days when I just don't want to be physically disturbed when meditating.  These cats are very Codependent, and when given the opportunity to lay on my lap, they take it. 

I am still in the swing of things of relearning awareness, letting thoughts pass, letting go of distraction.  I have tried isolating myself in my bedroom... But they scratch at the door and meow for me to let them in.  Often my only solution is to give in to their needs, give them the attention they seek, and wait for them to calm down and nap next to me. I do this so I feel as though I will be free to meditate with minimal disturbances.  The time I spend with them beforehand is used as practice to be mindful, and help calm my often racing mind. I have had success with this, but it can sometimes feel as a time sink, and I am struggling with not letting these thoughts become obsessive. 

Have anyone else here shared similar experiences with pets? How have you coped with the extra distraction of your beloved partners? I would love to get some extra insight on the topic.",0
"I’ve been doing meditation on and off for the past 2 years. Today during my practice I found a very entertaining way to stay focused on the breath.

I would picture myself sitting in the center of the universe, then as I breathed in I watched all of the stars and planets get sucked into my body. After this, all I could see was white. I would hold the universe in my lungs for a bit, then exhale and watch the planets &amp; stars come shooting back out. I would take a second to look around the beautiful universe I created and was apart of, then inhale again. 

Over and over I watched the destruction and construction of my own solar system as I breathed in and out. 

It really made me feel at peace &amp; made me feel as if I were really outside of the entire universe. I was there alone with just my body and breath, quite an amazing feeling :) 

Let me know what you guys do/if you found this helpful! Have a good day &amp; stay mindful!",0

"I have a problem. Most times, when i focus on my breath, i have the same problem. I see but mostly hear things, in basiclly the same way as in dreams. They are very random, and i am not thinking activly. When i have them i have to options:
1.Observe them and see where they are going. This has allways resultet with me falling asleep
2. Focus very hard on my breath. This feels like waking up, but it only lasts around 5 sekunds, before those ""thoughts"" return. This also very exhausting since it is just like fighting falling asleep, even if it is alot slower, compared to times where i am just tired.

I know the solution is easy: just keep my eyes open.
But i really enjoy meditating with my eyes closed.(when i don't have these thoughts)

So that is why i am asking you, if you have had any similar experiences or maybe even know what i am talking about.
Or if you don't, i would really appreaciate it, if you could share your experiences. Or if you would advise me to keep on ""fighting"" those ""thoughts"" or if i should follow them, to maybe find there roots.

Also: I get enough sleep(around 7.30-9h) each night. But i do feel tired quite often.

Thank you in advance.",0
"[Correct vs Incorrect posture](https://i.imgur.com/avf9M8m.jpg)

&gt;""The posture without excessive lordosis (right picture) is indeed healthier for the spine...less prone long-term to disc herniation and other issues. But in terms of zazen, someone sitting with pelvis tilted and back curved as in the left photo cannot breathe deeply at all...the diaphragm cannot move freely and fully. This means that the method of breath cultivation that is foundational in Rinzai practice, and upon which cultivation of profound samadhi and the ability to bodily work with practice methods like koan/wato depends, will be impossible.""  ~Roshi Meido Moore

Of course that is from a Rinzai zen perspective, but the physical effects with a posture like that are universal. The diaphragm will not move freely and you will wind up with a sore back or worse. 

Some people like to claim posture isn't important. Well, it is important if you don't want back pain!",0
"I've seen a few people in this thread saying that there feelings of anxiety worsen when meditating. I've just come across this article, that some people may find interesting or an answer.

"I was meditating during my train ride when I realized something that I'd consider very important. You need white to have black and you need black to have white. A white painting on a white background is just white and not a painting, just like a black painting on a black background is just black and not a painting. To have a painting you need at least both of those.

I've noticed during the my meditation on my train ride that my awareness is the same. When I focus on something I also focus on nothing. It's paradoxical, but it's the way my awareness works. Focus on one thing and you'll find yourself focusing on nothing. Focus on nothing and you'll find yourself focusing on something. If I try to focus on something it won't work, it seems that I either have to jump to something else or nothing at all. The same happens when I try to focus on nothing, it doesn't work. I jump back to something. But interestingly enough if I start observing both my focus on something and nothing I can maintain it. 

So what does this teach me? Perhaps that it's impossible to ever focus on only emptiness itself? Perhaps it's impossible to ever focus on only something? Perhaps I should try focusing on something and at the same on nothing at all, doing the illogical and paradoxical.",0
"Stillness is defined by a lack of movement. What is calm and still in nature moves slowly or not at all, with a vastness and consistency that humbles as much as it inspires. I look at the stolid dependability of a tree or a boulder and remember that we have much to learn about life from these objects that we write off as lifeless.

As soon as you begin to focus on an object with a certain benign indifference, you’ll find life in it. Everything is charged with some sort of energy. I don’t mean this in a hippie dippie acid dream sense, but instead in a simple perceptual sense. The energy of a given external stimulus is determined by how you judge it. If you train your attention to be neutral, you uncover unforeseen opportunities and begin to see nuances.

Meditation practice challenges us to find this stillness. By willfully exposing ourselves to a lack of movement, we grant ourselves permission to tune into the spontaneous stillness of nature. Finding the stillness is much like zoning in to a special frequency. Most of the time we’re tuned to a loud and chaotic frequency full of ambitions, desires, judgments and anxieties, but a frequency of meditative stillness exists pervasively beneath all of this. Like darkness, it precedes light. It floats under what we perceive to be reality, and as a result it often reflects deeper truths than what we see on the surface.

My mind always tries to throw off the stillness. This is the specialty of the human; it arrogantly and naively attempts to assert its own subjectivity on an objective and uncaring whole. Nature is the substructure, human projection the superstructure. We build an artificial reality on top of a natural reality that already exists, and thus over time the layers thicken and we become less aware of true reality. Meditation is a truly revelatory act in these times; it helps us slowly return to these natural depths and contemplate what true being is. This is a practice that society as a whole has long forgotten. Reviving it is key to our survival and humility as a species.

"Let me just start by saying I stopped consuming the news a long time ago and am no longer personally on social media, but sometimes certain news stories make it back to me. Sometimes I can't help reading more when something really strikes fear in me but that's rare. When it does happen though, I'm literally unable to take myself out of swimming in those icky feelings for an uncomfortable amount of time.

When I hear something disturbing or depressing it can make me feel super down for hours to days in a way that many of my ""local"" thoughts don't. Especially things that evoke fear (like mass shootings) or  or something just depressing (like the opioid epidemic) or gross excerpts (like reading about an incel who tweeted an extremely sexually derogatory thing about women) - all these tend to make me fearful of the world or wary about other people. The latter is a stronger emotion. It does make the world seem like a truly dark and gross place for a while.

I try to distract myself, if I have the time, by watching/reading about good people and positive things in the world. It doesn't necessarily work. These thoughts in particular are really sticky and take a long time to unstick. While I'm trying to unstick from these thoughts, or if i don't have the time and have to power through a task, my day takes on a totally different mood. I'm aware of what's happening, but I can't see it and disengage with it as I can with other thoughts. These thoughts make me fearful of the people that are around since, for some unfounded reason, I never thought people like the people in the news actually existed before the internet/social media really took over. I'm not saying I'm perfect, just that I am perhaps naive and sheltered, but learning about negative reality doesn't make me happier *or*, more importantly, more effective at helping.

I've been meditating 2-3x for 2 years and it's still something I can't seem to  be fully aware of, or have the choice to disengage with. What can I do to deal with this?",0

"It has been 24 days since I broke up with my ex. It has been hard for me. After a meditation session today, I began to feel a deep sadness in my heart. I realized that it was more than I had been feeling before this. I realized that instead of slowing down to properly feel my emotions, I was going fast and distracting myself with everything I could after the breakup.

Now, more than three weeks after, it all released. I was on a walk when, stemming from the sadness I was feeling, sobs began to overcome me. It was the first time I truly felt the grief of loss after I broke up with her... So I let myself cry. I let it all out. I didn't hold back. Waves of emotion passed through me, and I cried hard. I sat there and felt it all.

After that, I felt a little bit better. I can only hope that this experience and hardship will one day have me coming out the other end a stronger person. It's amazing how meditation can allow us to look into ourselves and release what needs to be released. Because in order to move on, you have to feel all the emotions you want to avoid.

Just wanted to share my experience. Thanks for reading.",0

"Hello!

So I've been meditating for some time and have been doing it in various ways. Now as I'm learning about posture and my goal is to train myself to sit in a seated meditation for hours on end without having a hard time physically.

Whwt do I mean by that? Whenever I meditate, my legs in cross legged posture go numb after 20min. Also when I do that posture, my right side of the back is doing all the work to hold the posture.

Any suggestions how can I train my left and right back imbalances? And maybe tips for current meditation daily practice that would alleviate the load and I'd be able to sit for 40mins or even longer?",0
"I have been meditating quite successfully for about 2 years now. Simple mindfulness meditation, concentrating on the breath, acknowledging thoughts and letting them go. I use it to calm my mind and, through that, to relax my muscles which tense up whenever my thoughts are too many and too chaotic. With that, I have a very reliable sign and meter for my mental well being - if I meditate enough, I can be almost relaxed; if I don't, things get tense and painful.

Now for my question: After about 15 minutes there often is a moment when I forget to watch my breath and thoughts and get swept away in some daydream. When this happens, it is accompanied by a peaceful feeling, a calm mind (not empty though) and a noticeable relaxation of the muscles.

I enjoy this a lot. But isn't this kinda the opposite of what we are trying to achieve when focusing on the breath and letting thoughts pass in order to have fewer of them?

In the first 10 minutes I would actively recognize upcoming thoughts, label them, return to my breath. While this in itself feels good, it also feels a bit like work. I'm still doing something, focusing. And then the real freedom seems to come only when I fail in being mindful?

What do you all think of that?",0
"I think this is a relevant sub to post this question in. 

There's this common problem that a lot of people have. They might enjoy an activity or hobby.......however after a certain point, it starts to become a drag. The point can vary from people to people. Some people don't even have a point if the hobby in question is their number one passion. However for most activities and most people, this point exist. Especially if its something that requires long hours of work like Animation or programming. They don't necessarily hate the activity after going beyond this point, but they lose motivation and that spark that makes the activity really fun. It becomes monotonous after this point. 

I have this problem with this animation. When I started it as a hobby, I used to love it. Used to spend hours every day working on my own projects. But then when I pursued it further at university and it became more of a job to me......that's when it lost its spark. Felt like a drag. I still feel motivation from time to time but its not as exciting as it was before when it was a hobby. 

This is a mental thing. When it was a hobby, I chose to do it. When it became like a job, I was forced to do it. So even though I was doing the exact same thing and spending the same number of hours, the motivation depended on what context I was working in. So I know this is all in the head, and nothing else. 

Is it possible to use the same philosophies used in meditation to make yourself voluntarily enjoy an activity even though it seems like a drag? How do you make your mind do it? Whenever I enjoy my work, the quality of it improves, so enjoyment is very important.",0
"So after a bad break up from a long term relationship (14-19)  I have been meditating every day using headspace for about 70 days. 

I'm finding that being in a mindful state and letting thoughts pass me by and focusing in the moment just leaves me with a sort of sad aftertaste or tone to my life and is quite easy to still react negatively to some troubling persistent thoughts. And these thoughts are almost always there. 

Whereas recently, I have been adopting the 'fuck thinking or caring about that' mentality and it seems to be working in terms of im not getting sad anymore and its more mild anger which is directed at work and actually makes me work harder. ( I work in house removals so the anger rush gets taken out on me carrying boxes upstairs fast lol and is followed by a sense of relief and joy)

I really want to stay with the meditation journey and be filled with gratitude and compassion whilst letting thoughts go BUT im thinking a sort of anger mentality is more effective right now? I'm interested to know what anyone thinks, thanks.",0
"I've been reading Alan Watts recently, and he makes this beautiful point about concentration, and that to not debate the nature of why you're concentrating or whether you're concentrating or not, but to just do it.

I applied that for the first time today, it was something I was already beginning to understand, and then today, though not for long, there were times where it was pure consciousness, pure concentration. It would last a maximum of like five seconds and then my mind would go 'this is great' and hence ruin the whole thing. But I'm not disheartened by that. I know where I'm going with this now. 

It's weird. What I'd thought meditation was has now changed, but for the better. It's actually really so painfully simple conceptually, and it's actually this over simplicity which makes things hard. All meditation requires is to simply 'be'. That's it. Don't think about whether you're sat in the right position, or whether you're doing it for long enough, or any of those things. Just be. Relax, breathe naturally and don't complicate things.

I meditated for half an hour today, and that's my new personal record. I hate to turn it into an achievement because ultimately that's not the end goal, about doing it for longer. What matters is that I feel as if it's not as hard as I thought it was now. When I started out meditating, I was putting so much pressure on myself and ultimately my ego would always bounce back when things weren't going my way and I would just give up because eventually what I'd think is, 'oh ffs this isn't working there's no point.' Part of the beauty is to actually explore that. Recognising that you are finding it difficult and getting back to just 'being'. 

I'm sure there will be a lot of experts who might see this as basic shit or even think I'm not doing it properly, but I write this for beginners like myself to persevere and to not put pressure on themselves. Even if you have a session where your ego is louder than normal and you can't seem to concentrate for one second, stick with it. You're building resistance through becoming the observer, and if you are like me, it will become easier with time.",0
"Until about 2-3 weeks ago i was in one of the worst depressive episodes of my life (lasted almost all summer). I started meditating again mid last month.

I don’t know when in the last 2-3 weeks it happened but it did.

My one advice for everyone is to stop constantly checking your progress. Keep meditating and one day hopefully you too will be in the middle of an errand and just realize how different life suddenly is.",0
"Was watching Sam Harris talk to the minimalists today. He said that if he had to give a pithy answer about living a meaningful life and keeping suffering to a minimum then it would be that ""when you're suffering you're lost in thought.""

It's no secret that most of us spend most of our lives lost in thought, though for people with OCD I would suspect it's even worse. Intrusive thoughts can come in at any time and spoil any ""presence"" one is lucky enough to stumble across at any given moment. 

I'm not going to beat around the bush here, I'm very depressed and anxious and suicidal and life for me is generally quite painful. Mostly due to internal rather than external circumstances. I have a good life, family etc. My job makes me pretty miserable in fairness but I'm fairly confident most of my problems are due to my state of mind. 

I do meditate for ten minutes every day, I have been since late last year and I'm tempted to say it has been helping somewhat, though as this post indicates it's clearly not enough on its own. 

I'm gonna go get some therapy in an attempt to try and make life less painful. Lately, I've often been waking up with morning anxiety and morning sickness (dry heaving, unable to eat). Occasionally my first thought, when I wake up, is ""your parents are going to die one day"", and that sends my head into a spin. 

Why do I have to worry about things I can't control, things that haven't happened yet. There's no utility in this worry whatsoever. It's just pointless. 

Anyway, as I said I'm gonna go and get some CBT in an effort to combat this. I'm almost afraid to honestly because I've had my hopes raised and destroyed so many times that I'm afraid of feeling that again because it's awful and fills me with the deepest despair. 

I suppose the point of this post is to ask, how feasible is it for a person with OCD to reach a state of mindfulness with only meditation in their psychological toolkit or is much more needed just to get you through one's life. I've tried medication and I'm not a fan. CBT is the only thing I've never really committed to. 

Because ultimately, if it's difficult for a regular person to reduce the quantity of though interrupting the present moment then for a person with OCD it must be ultra-hard. And I'm not sure I can cope anymore.

"I'm still fairly new to meditating. Maybe three months in. I'm in a phase where I'm just trying everything. I have some favorite methods and I try the ones I find online. 


But. I know a lot of people have some things to say about some of the guided meditations on YouTube. Specifically the ones that promise you things like manifestation or traveling to the akashic records or reduce anxiety and depression. 


But I have noticed some guided meditations do seem to work well for me. So I was curious if anyone with more experience would offer opinions of some. Either good or bad.  I know it's different for everyone but I think any newbie would like to know.",0
"I had a very emotionally stressful weekend that triggered a lot of my past troubles and made my anxiety flare up really bad. Last night I laid in bed meditating asking for my spirit guides and guardian angels to come and help guide me. Guide me to my right path and to help me release any negative energy, thoughts, or fears that were keeping me from my truth. I felt tears drop as I was thinking these things and I believed them with all sincerity. As I was continuing my request. My eyes, which were closed, went from seeing darkness to a bright sky blue. Not as if there was a light in my room, that’s just the color it changed too. Then I heard, not with my ears, but in my mind another thought other than mine that said, “ I am Mother Mary.” Right at that moment I felt a huge sense of relief, like an end to my sadness. I felt comforted and calmed, and I started singing “Let It Be” by The Beatles in my mind out of nowhere. My meditation was disrupted by my neighbors and I came out of it. I know I wasn’t asleep yet because I am aware of all my thoughts and sounds around me. I laid there for a few minutes trying to process what had just happened. I still can’t figure it out.

"I have been meditating for more than a year. I know all the ideas and concepts of leting go, accepting, surrender to reality, unconditional love,  awareness etc. Had some epiphanies, self realizations which helped me for a while. Nowadays It seems I just can't let go of my ego anymore. I get angry more often. Sometimes I try to be mindful and not act on it. Sometimes I act on it, then feel guilty. I judge more often, become reactive. I know I should not be doing it, at least I am aware of ego doing that. I feels like I am going backwards and my ego is dominating me more than before. There are so many ideas and concept in my head, my mind always try to reach a conclusion from them to justify my action. I felt a huge shift in my motivation, level of happiness, satisfaction in the beginning of this year. I accomplished things which I never thought  I could do. I felt good all time like being high 24/7. I felt real joy and fullfuillment. Suddenly it all stopped. Everything started to seem meaningless, depressing. The self improving, spiritual ideas don’t interest me anymore. Nothing feels real anymore. I feel like a negative fearful energy always trapped inside me. I crave for that lost good feeling I used to feel. I always keep searching in my head what was that idea that triggered the transformation.  Why am i not progressing anymore? Should I increase the duration of meditation or follow any different technique? How do I stop this downward spiral of depression and self judgement?",0
"I started to like her last year during our high school dance lessons, then it developed to a slight crush for the rest of the past school year. Summer break seemed to diminish my crush on her. Then I started my meditation and NoFap journey. Everything looked fine.

During the past few weeks, I noticed that I still have feelings for her, this time (maybe because of meditation etc.) it feels much stronger. When I have nothing else to do, I can't stop thinking about her.

I haven't told her, I decided that will dedicate the rest of this year to meditation and celibacy. Because I think I need to work on my self esteem, confidence and school duties first, and meditation seems to be very helpful.

My question is: How to deal with such intense emotions, noticing them and reminding myself that it will pass, barely seems to affect them.",0

"Hi all! 

I’m somewhat new to the community and I’ve been inspired to get into meditating more seriously. So far I’ve really only done it as a component of a yoga class or way to fall asleep, but I’d like to pick it up as a daily habit. Since I’m so new I’d like to start with guided meditations to help me stay on track and learn how to meditate better. 

I’m looking specifically for improved focus and more self control- I feel like I’m lacking in my ability to control my brain from just autopiloting to social media (yeah, the irony of this post is not lost on me), I’m not as good about saying no to sweets as I should be, and I just generally have a hard time with my attention span and focus.

"I've found Sam Harris's Waking Up app to be very helpful in learning how to meditate. This is partly because Sam goes so far out of his way to avoid anything that might even get close to bordering on belief. But as I get a little more comfortable with the practice, and listen to other well known figures like Ram Dass (who unlike Sam talks enthusiastically and with apparent sincerity about Hindu gods like Hanuman), I find myself getting more and more curious about the religious underpinnings of the practice. At the same time, I'm a typical western secularist and wouldn't have much ability to tolerate blatant proselytizing. Does anyone have any recommendations for good sources on Hindu or Buddhist belief that sort of fit into that niche of taking the belief seriously without trying to convert you?",0
"My task is to stop berating myself when I make mistakes.

I don’t need to feel any shame for my actions that are performed with good intentions. I just need to take note of how I can modify my behavior, and try my best to implement that behavior.

I do not intend to inconvenience or confuse people. Sometimes I go on autopilot and get lost in thought, and I make mistakes because of it. THIS IS THE STAGE I AM IN. I don’t need to hate myself for this. What I need to do is continue to work toward good mental and physical health, and peacefulness.

I failed to deal with some painful losses in my life in a healthy way, so I turned to alcohol for about a year. This is the main reason I lack mental clarity. Now that I’m sober and getting healthier physically, mentally, and emotionally, I know my life is going to get easier and simple tasks aren’t going to feel like such a burden. So right now, my task is to trust that all is coming in time and practice, and I shouldn’t hate myself for the stage I’m at, even though I'm not satisfied with it. I can hold onto that dissatisfaction with myself lovingly. Deep down, I love myself, so I want to be healthy and have great mental clarity.

I don't think people choose to become addicts. No one wants that. Many people are ignorant of how addictions form, and they're egotistical thinking that they are above chemical dependency. That ego has to come from somewhere, I don't even think we choose to have big egos or choose to be arrogant/selfish/etc..

There was no buddhism, no yoga or meditation teacher, no therapist in my world growing up. I became conditioned to respond to things a certain way, and while I did use my will to make lots of choices that shaped who I am, I was only presented with so many options for how I was going to respond to the world. I often felt forced to go along with things and do what was expected of me by my parents and friends.

Because literally ALL of my friends in the neighborhood were homophobic, (white suburb in Southern U.S.) I felt like I had no choice but to be too, so for a few years when I was about 8-12, I made very hateful ""jokes"" about gay people just to be included. I wasn't strong enough to choose to stand up to my friends, which is too bad, but should I hate myself for it? I have to believe that hateful people, egomaniacs and addicts deserve love too. I can't just hate myself forever, even though I now view things like homophobia as one of the worst traits a human being can possibly have. I might have been a brat, but I wasn't evil. I was just scared of being rejected by my friends. It may not have even occurred to me that being gay could possibly be anything other than wrong. That was just the reality I was presented with.

In general, I highly doubt people are gonna harm themselves with alcohol or anything else if they're emotionally well-adjusted and happy- I don't know yet what the ""root cause"" is that makes alcohol feel so good to me, all I know is that I've always had anxiety even since I was around middle school age (24 now), and alcohol has always taken it away.

I am going to manage my anxiety and stay sober. And I know that you are going to achieve whatever sort of peacefulness you are searching for too &lt;3 Thanks for reading my emotionally-charged ranting :D",0
"Hi all!

We all know that it can be hard to start and maintain a regular sitting practice. So I wondered if anyone would care to join me in a daily meditation challenge for October?

I've set up a monthly meditation challenge for the last eighteen months, and it's really seemed to strike a chord here and received lots of engagement and positive feedback over that time. I stuck to daily meditation throughout much of that time myself (struggled a little some months, but I do have a two year old son at the moment!), and many others who took part have managed consistent practice throughout that time. It provided a lovely sense of community and lots of encouragement.

So, here's the deal:

You choose how much time you want to spend meditating each day, and what sort of meditation you're going to practice. But you commit to practicing every day for the month of October, and maybe check in on here with others who are doing the same. The idea is to have some group support/accountability, to help you stick to daily practice all month long.

If it goes well, then we rinse and repeat for the month of November. I'll make a new post for that when the time comes.

Post a comment below if you'd like to take part. And if you'd like an accountability partner to really help see you through your daily practice, post a comment below that says ""accountability partner needed"". Then wait for someone else to reply to your comment, and say ""I'll be your partner"". You can help keep each other in check throughout the month.

For those who use Insight Timer, there is a group for this called Meditation Month. Feel free to join up and find some extra accountability there.

For those who use it, there is also a discord server for this. I won't be over there myself, but if you want to join the url is https://discord.gg/afyEk32 - thanks to /u/3DimenZ for setting it up.

Good luck folks. Hope this helps some of you start a meditation habit and others get back into one.

TLDR: Encouragement and support for people trying to make daily meditation stick!

NOTE: I like to encourage everyone who wants to take part and who leaves a comment below by wishing them luck and other little things in response. But I don't reply to people who have asked for an accountability partner in their comment because I don't want them to get a little ""new message"" icon and get hopeful only to find it's me saying ""good luck!"", and also because I think people scanning comments to see if anyone needs a partner might more easily look past those that already have a reply, even if the reply is just from me and isn't actually an offer to be a partner. Just wanted to let those folks who don't get a reply from me know that it's nothing personal! I wish you luck too, and am pleased you're taking part! :)

NOTE 2: Since starting these monthly challenges, the Insight Timer group has grown to 900+ members, and the Discord even more than that! So join in and help make meditation a regular part of your life!

Maybe I don't need to do anything. Maybe 

Just.

"I just started meditating this week, but I've found meditating to be really helpful for my anxiety and work productivity.  When my mind would normally run off through stressful fantasy scenarios and worries I've been able to catch it and recenter my focus on either my breath or what I'm doing.  Sleeping was really really difficult for me because my mind would race even faster, thinking about and imagining anything and everything.  I've been using the same techniques to help me sleep at night and it works, my mind still wants to take off but I try not to let thoughts get carried away and I've been able to sleep (so far) a 24h 30m cycle whereas before I was on maybe a 30h cycle roughly, depending on the day.  Still have to get better at the waking up part to actually keep 24 hours lol.

So the part this is all leading up to.  Ever since I started this, my dreams have been *really* vivid, on the level of my most vivid dreams and it's every night.  I'm also waking up multiple times throughout the night, however I don't know if that's new or if I'm just noticing it now but that's also every night, usually once in the middle of the night and once around sunrise.

"Hello all,

I’m currently studying abroad and taking some time in solitude to do a little introspection. I’ve practiced meditation inconsistently for years, but for the last 6 weeks I’ve been going at it twice a day and I feel amazing.

I write to you all because I’ve recently noticed the lack of control my significant other has over her emotions. I’ve always been the more level headed one in the relationship, and I try not to let her mood effect mine (a difficult task I find myself struggling with, but one I’m getting better at through my practice).

Furthermore, I’ve tried to explain the benefits of practice but she hasn’t taken to it. I’m nearing the end of my college career and we will soon be discussing whether we should end it as a college fling, or make an effort to stay together. I’m not here to ask for relationship advice, instead I’m curious if anyone has any input based on their current/past relationships.

Does your significant other practice meditation? If not, do you find yourself bothered by their lack of emotional understanding/insight which you’ve gained through your practice? Am I looking at this the wrong way, and should instead learn to accept her mood as external and focus on my internal sense of calm?

Any and all responses would be appreciated :)",0
"Most people experience thoughts verbally. Fewer people are aware of the conceptual structure of thought. It's actually possible to experience the concept without the verbal thought that arises.

Very few people are aware that emotions are the carrier wave of thought. It's possible to develop an awareness that discerns the concept, the verbalization, and the underlying emotional tone of thought.

Generally speaking, if you have a thought, particularly one you have identified with, then that thought is always carried by emotional current. Ordinary thought, for the vast majority of people, is never truly rational.

Since these emotions are carrier waves of thought and concepts, there is a kind of negotiation that takes place in your mind and body. What may seem conceptually illogical to other people feels logical to yourself, because the way two thoughts link together are carried by the same emotional current, or have resonance.

Thoughts that seem irrational has more to do with thoughts carried by dissonant emotional current, than it does with concepts that are actually logical.

When an emotional current that carries a thought is unpleasant, people try not to think about that thought. That is experienced anywhere from that nagging itch in your subconscious, to violent emotions that lead to personal attacks to other people, to outright ignorance where the person literally blocks it out of their mind. These are aversions.

When an emotional current carries a thought that is pleasant, people try to cling on to it. These are graspings. Grasping is part of how we form identities around thoughts. These thoughts come in the form of, ""I am ..."". For example, careers (""I am a scientist"", ""I am a mechanic"", ""I am a software engineer""), group memberships (""I am a Quoran""), nationalism (""I am American""), racial identity (""I am Asian""), gender identity (""I am male"", ""I am female"", ""I am transgendered""). We do this to form various stories or narratives about our lives (""I am a good person"", ""I am persecuted"", ""I am a hero-entrepreneur"", ""I am a hacker living at the edge of the law"").

Sometimes the emotional current, driven by the carrot (graspings) and stick (aversions), often time leads thought patterns into a loop. It's not that there is a logical loop, it's that the emotional current that carries those thoughts goes in loops.

There is no way to logic your way out of these kinds of loops, or truly validate your own thoughts. That's because, in order to use logic, the way most people use it, requires an emotional current to carry thoughts. The typical emotional current someone uses to logic their way out of things is forms of self-judgement, denial, etc.

There is a very fast and simple way to get to the stillness, from which you stop this identity. (The fast way is not necessarily the easiest way):

- Take an inhale.
- Let it go in an exhale.
- Take an inhale
- Let it go in an exhale. As you let it go, find that gap between the exhale and the inhale. This gap is natural. This is a gap of stillness, where it feels like everything stops. Try this as many times as you can get this.
- Once you can find that gap of stillness between the exhale and the inhale, look for the gap of stillness between the inhale and exhale.
- When you can clearly find the stillness between the two parts of breath, look for the stillness from which the breath arises. What will happen is that the experience of that stillness will start to grow until it becomes continuous.
- Flip your perception, where that stillness is the vast reality, and the breath merely arises and passes in the stillness.

Stay there. You will likely notice that thoughts will start arising and passing in this stillness. Just as you recognize the breath as empty, recognize the thought, it's underlying emotions, and the sensations as empty.

A related technique is to learn to ""listen to the silence."" Silence is where all sounds arises from. So first get comfortable with finding the stillness in the breath. Then, be aware of the internal dialogues that arises. Then listen to the sound of the internal dialogue, not necessarily the content. Then listen to Silence from which that sound arises from. That Silence is the same as the stillness, experienced aurally rather than kinesthetically. If you can listen to the silence, it is one of the fastest ways to sort out what is bullshit in your mind.

"Identification with thought.

Human beings are the most self-suffering creatures on this planet and the greatest irony is, that we are suffering because of our own actions. We have almost wiped out half the species from the planet to bring well being to ourselves and in spite of all our ""comfort"" we are still not happy. 

The fundamental reason for this discontent and unhappiness is that we are not able to handle our own mind - we are too identified with our own thought process. The nature of the mind is such that once it gets identified with anything, it will only think about that. 

So if you are really interested in your own wellbeing, the first and foremost thing which you need to do is to stop identifying with your own thoughts, they are not even yours. Your thoughts are essentially coming from all of the information which you have collected from your environment, filtered through all your prejudices, judgement and conditioning.

This entire concept of non identification with your ""own"" thoughts is hard for most people to grasp, but this is truly the source of most of our self inflicted suffering.",0

"Practicing mindfulness with the knowledge that noting bad thoughts can make you happy sometimes sets it up in the mind as process with a result - making certain negative/limiting thoughts bad guys in that process that 'need' to be noted. 
This directly opposes the larger idea that thoughts are mental events that don't inherently have power.

Sometimes, that means I seek immediate feedback that I did it right when using mental noting (maybe wanting the feeling to disappear or to feel some internal click after I note a thought). This is thrown me into a loop with off-the-cushion the practice for about a year now. 

So, how can you practice noting/mindfulness without seeking a result when you know doing it right can make you happy?",0

"Hello Reddit. For the past dozen or so weeks I have been meditating daily, the majority of which with the guidance of the Waking Up app. It has been great, and I am keen to explore my practice further. 

Lately I have started to notice that during my formal meditation sessions I can spend quite long periods lost in thought. Of course, the more I meditate, the more I realise I am lost in thought (read: the more I realise how crazy I am), and I start to notice thoughts in all kinds of dusty nooks and crannies. But even though I feel this deepening of awareness, I feel like my concentration could be improved. In particular I would like to be able to concentrate on my breath longer without getting lost in thought (sometimes I'll get lost in thought and snap out of it, ""Okay man, it's time to focus on your breath,"" only to get lost in the same train of thought seconds later). (As a side note: I find it totally amazing how 'lost' you can be while lost in thought. Sometimes snapping out of a train of thought is as jarring as opening your eyes onto a brightly lit landscape.)

So my question is, can you recommend some complementary meditation to supplement my daily mindfulness practice? Is this a matter of 'keep practicing'?

"Hi!

After 2,5 years of daily practice (from 30 minutes to two hours per day) I'm looking to do a teacher training. I'm thinking mindfullness, but I'm open to suggestions (if there's a training that involves several styles, say metta &amp; mindfullness, that would be cool). The spiritual philosophy that appeals to me the most is advaita vedanta. Maybe I'm bit of an eclectic!  


Has anyone here taken a teacher training they would recommend? I'm looking for the intensive versions, not the ones where you do a couple retreats over the course of a year or so. Thanks!",0

"Hey everyone, hope you're having a good day.

I have aphantasia, a condition where i am unable to voluntarily visualize images in my head. When i close my eyes and try to visualize something it is completely dark. I can not even visualize the faintest shapes of something.

This causes me to not really understand and be able to enjoy the full benefits of visualization in meditation. Eventhough i think it would be so beneficial in a lot of situations.

Is there anybody here with the same condition that knows how to deal with this? Or does anybody have any tips on this matter?

Any help and thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

Much love",0

"Why one does not see ‘what is True’?

One is carried away as if science, economics or religion-spirituality will remove or undo pain and uncertainty one faces in daily life.

One is carried away as if some one else (guru and so on) has solved the enigma of life and is living as relieved, pleased.

One is carried away as if addition to possessions, relations or knowledge will give one stable relief, stable pleasure.

All pain and uncertainty is psychological discomfort, if you are not in immediate physical danger. Unless you absorb this discomfort without any explanation, there is no chance of seeing ‘what is True’.

Whatever one is experiencing – confusion, irritation, happiness, fear – not to run away to solaces or other explanations to cover up what one is experiencing, is the key.",0
"Through my meditation practice I have reached a state where I am really not afraid of anything and I fundamentally don’t care whether I “succeed” in life or not. But there is a constant battle inside me between the part of me that believes that and the part of me that wants to get rich and “succeed” by societys standards. The thing is that I don’t want to get rid of these wishes as I would feel like if I never reach wealth and get to live the rich life I would be missing out on 50% of the action. I don’t see money as the measure of success or the goal of my life but rather as something that I want to try out (being rich, that is).

And from there comes my fear “what if I never get to experience the rich life” and that anxiety is constantly making me feel like I’m not enough..

Any advice?",0

Remember love

All which is understood
Happening now

"Hi, Im new and this is my first post. 
I started meditation a few months ago and been constant since start. I felt changes and evolution everyday. 
I've been reading this sub and TMI sub mostly, some here and there and digging about this in lot of aspects and places. I Went to a buddist meditation centre close to my place once to check and am finishing Shinryu suzuki's zen mind, begginner mind. But i must say that you are my teachers, i sincerely thank you for your dedication to help and be nice, even though this is my first post, your help to others reached me too S2

The thing is... Now that im aware/alert a llllot, i noticed that the only way i can sleep is to let my mind wander.
I noticed this when i started to come back from wandering automatically as a consecuence from practice and it would kick me up from almost sleeping.  Now there are a lot of days that my mind just doesnt wander and i lay quiet and sleep just doesnt come anymore..

Its weird because i read you can sleep beeing aware soo..

Please give me some pointers and love you all for this.

i'll try to sleep now",0
"In meditation and self help fields the word consciousness and awareness are used all the time. As a newbie to it, it was difficult to understand exactly what it meant and how to expand it. After an experience a few days ago at the basketball court while working on my dribbling I noticed the current limits of my awareness.  The drill I was doing was to stare at the backboard while dribbling the ball to the right hand, left hand, through the legs etc.  Now this isn't hard for everybody but doing this while keeping awareness of your feet and hands and keeping a steady stream of vision on the hoop was challenging. I realized my eyes would be pointed at the hoop while dribbling but I wouldn't actually be looking at the hoop. It was almost like I was day dreaming because I was focused on something I couldn't see. And I found trying to stare at one spot, while keeping a dribble without going into this day dream mode was challenging.

The way awareness makes sense to me is to look at your awareness as an empty space.  The space is filled up with your body and sense organs. So you have the *basic 5 senses*  but **two additional senses** as well which are **thoughts and feelings**. The world is pretty much just a sea of vibrations, and your sense organs pick up different types of vibrations. The goal is to give all of these senses the same amount of attention and not to play favorites.  We play favorites to our vision when watching TV. Our hearing when listening to music and our thoughts when over thinking. Obviously some senses will dominate others depending on what your doing but you can always feel what's going on with your body no matter what's going on. An easy way to turn inward is feeling every step as you walk (or manual breathing) or while doing any activity will help you access deeper dimensions of life. Your field of awareness doesn't strive to be aware of anything, these senses just fall into your field of awareness like water filling up a cup. **So you don't expand your awareness forcefully, you learn to be more receptive**.   Being aware of your inner space while having external things going on feels like being in 2 dimensions of reality at once and is fascinating to me.

So being aware of the sensations of the ball on my fingers, the hoop, the sounds from the ball and the rest of the park, the ground underneath my feet, are all objects in my awareness.  I couldn't be aware of all of these things (not to mention my breath) at the same time for more then a few seconds because the brain naturally filters out things that are not of use at the time.  Most of us are just as unaware of these things in everyday life and I realize I can bring this basketball practice drill into everyday life. Like while talking to someone sometimes you feel like a floating head. Now I try to feel my feet on the floor and feel my hands and notice my breath. Even though I can't sustain this attention on these objects in my awareness for a long time it feels very natural and is a very good way to stay in the moment. Because staying in the moment is sort of like double dutch. You have to Jump into it and just GO.

By maintaining awareness throughout the day I can notice when a headache might be about to form and can adjust whatever I need to. I feel stomach aches when they're just forming and can start taking deep belly breaths.  I notice thought loops and can stop feeding them quicker. Thoughts are just in your head so by feeling your feet on the floor you'll notice those thoughts really aren't that big of a deal and are just one aspect of who you are. I hope this explanation helps the people who never could quite grasp awareness or realize the depths of it.",0

"I’m been meditating for half a year now. At first the change I felt was subtle, but overtime the changes were becoming more obvious. With all of this said I have definitely made some progress but I don’t feel like I’m where I’m “suppose” to be at 6 months. People talk of meditating for 2 months and are already seeing drastic changes, while I’m still dealing with monkey mind and can’t concentrate on my breathe to save me life. I asked myself (as well as others) what I was doing wrong, but I realize there’s no wrong or right way as long as I’m getting what I need out out a meditation; I can’t help but feel annoyed with myself that I haven’t mastered my “monkey mind by now”.",0

Here is the first video on youtube:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_CTPTZeD3Xs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTPTZeD3Xs)",0
"I posted something similar a few weeks ago but this has been bothering me so I figured I would post again. 

I have a really, really hard time being myself in a lot of social situations. I am still ""myself"", but a less fun/goofy/outgoing version of me, and as hard as I try I can't ""turn myself on"" (you know what I mean) and I almost am become exhausted just by trying to force myself to be myself. And I find myself unable to relax and feel uncomfortable/strained when socializing sometimes. It really pisses me off, because I will meet people and they will tell me I seem like a more shy person and introverted, but I know that they aren't getting the full version of me. Now, there have been plenty of times where somehow I've had no problem being myself and everything goes fantastically, but I can never figure out what that mental block is that is preventing me in the other situations. 

I always notice in social situations I feel me judging myself the whole time wondering if I look stupid, sound stupid, etc. And I find myself trying to please others (not by lying and saying stuff that they would like, but by saying nothing that would offend/upset/annoy etc) that I am interacting with, not directly, but it is kind of subconscious. 

Some back story: I used to be in a codependent relationship that I have since healed from, but I notice some codependent traits in myself sometimes, although I don't consider myself a codependent person completely. For example, at times, a big desire for acceptance, perfectionism, somewhat controlling, lack of trust, and low self worth. 

Another side note: I grew up religious but I am kind of reforming my beliefs on many things. For example, I started drinking alcohol but my whole lfe growing up I hated alcohol and thought it was a big sin and thought it was stupid but now I am doing it. So I am experiencing some cognitive dissonance as well. 

Sometimes I question ""who am I really"" and ""what do I actually believe about this thing?"" And all of this stuff can make it hard for me to connect with new people. I just care way too much about what people think about me (and I don't know why because I have plenty of things to be proud of and confident about) and I don't know how to stop it. Sorry for the massive amount of text, but thanks in advance for any help/tips/advice.",0
"I started meditating following Sam's (waking up) course three weeks ago. It's all interesting and makes sense to me, but even I'm trying to follow all of his lessons and following the instructions the best I can, nothing special was felt or experienced, besides the fact that I'm more relaxed and less reactive to my negative thoughts.

Today was different, after meditating and ending my session I went to bed as usual but.... jez. My attention was very very sharp, I felt some waves of pleasure going through my belly and it was like the whole stream of thought became very slow. I tried to maintain that good feeling of peace and happiness but it only lasted for 5 minutes.

Is it a thing that experienced mediators can reach with more facility? Should I increase the time of my sessions in order to feel it again? Thanks for reading.",0
I’ve never really been an anxious or stressed person until recently. I’m a senior in college and honestly just worrying about what I’m going to do after I graduate. I’ve wanted to start meditation for a while and I feel like it’s a perfect time for me to fully commit.,0
"I've been using this video's method of mindfulness breathing meditation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMMerxh_12U

Part of the advice it gives is to set an alarm timer to go off after your 5/10/20 minutes so you're not constantly wondering about your remaining time. That's all well and good, but I noticed that when it rings, even though it is pretty low volume and super soft in tone, it never fails to startle me. To the point where I'm sometimes reticent to start meditating, knowing a mini-jumpscare awaits at the end.

Has anyone encountered this? How did you solve this problem?",0
"I have been meditating for over 3 years now. I learned through headspace and then moved onto like 15-20 minutes of just silence. When I first started meditation I did it every day for a year and then I continued to be very structured with it until recently. 

My wife and I have a 4 month old daughter and she has been the focus every since she came out so my practice has slacked to 1-3 days a week tops. I tend to only meditate in the morning. 

Very recently though at work I got my own office and started to meditate in the afternoon. I will focus on my breath and quickly fall into this deep state of sleep/stillness. It’s hard for me to describe but I felt myself going from 10-15 minutes to 20-30 minute sessions. I don’t think it’s sleep because I have fallen asleep during it before and my head will nod out and I will awaken. It reminds me of when I would do a sensory deprivation tank or the short time when I was testing out mantra meditation. I’m not exactly conscious but then again I’m not completely unconscious. 

What would you call this state I reach? Any insight on what this is and how to treat this would be much appreciated. I feel like I stumbled upon something amazing but I would love some more information on it.",0

"I grew up in an unhealthy environment and developed a weak personality as a result. I'm meditating for quiet a while now, but i don't feel like im getting anywhere. Not focusing on your ego and the storylines about yourself and not resisting things are often a big topic in the meditation-app i'm using (headspace), but it's not like there is no identity at all, there is undeniably a core of your personality you can't change. And how am i supposed to not resist if this core of my personality is unfit for living? And even if i manage to accept all this, i'm still leading a pointless, hollow life. I don't know what to do right now and feel like i'm about to end it soon, if i can find the courage for it. Did anybody go through similar problems? Can anybody help me?",0

"Hi friends,    
I was on a retreat for a week. Some lectures were about meditation &amp; mindfulness. Here are some notes, which you might find interesting:
  
**Meditation**  
 * is to develop and cultivate mindfulness and positive mental states and learn to maintain stable attention.  
 * sequence: sitting posture, intentions, bodyscan+relaxation, and only then to the mediation object+background awareness.   
* the mind is trained through intentions (e.g. mindful, loving, alert, interested, confident), repetitions (joy, gratitude after distraction &amp; intentions) &amp; positive conditioning.  
* getting to know, training, healing the mind  
  
**Mindfulness**   
* is the optimal/appropriate interaction between attention and background awareness.   
* comes from ""sati"", literally translated: to remember  
* collection is the consequence of regular mindfulness practice.  
* practice of Metta as a balance to mindfulness  
* four basics: body+movement, mood+feelings, sensations (pleasant, neutral, unpleasant), reality  
* four areas: Environment, Self, Other, Reality  
* thoughts about the future and the past are mindful when they are done consciously and intentionally.   
  
I had my notes translated from German by Deepl, so some terms may not be entirely consistent.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

"...so I did a reset: I took a month off, started reading The Mind Illuminated (thanks to everyone who suggested that), and started over with 5 minutes, twice a day--increasing it by a minute every week until I hit twenty minutes twice a day.  

And I'm fed up again. 

[As before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/b5ibal/two_years_of_daily_meditationand_its_still_a_chore/), my twice daily sits are just a chore.   I'm convinced my *technique* is better (thanks to the book), but the results/rewards/experience is still essentially a slog.  I can't say I haven't gotten *anything* from the practice, but the rewards aren't outweighing the challenges.   

The sessions are rarely *unpleasant*\--I can physically sit for the 20 minutes--but after almost three years it would be nice to find myself *welcoming* the opportunity to sit rather than the ever-present ""Ugh, I've got to do *this* again..."".  

So why not just stop?    That's what I'm wrestling with at the moment.   If this is an important (inevitable?) part of the process, then I'd hate to give up at an important milestone.  On the other hand, if this just isn't for me, then why keep banging my head against this wall?",0

DIAMOND SUTRA

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK9u7Jz-vNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK9u7Jz-vNA)

&amp;#x200B;

3:42 - no form or phenomenon (ego, personality, self, separate person, universal self)

&amp;#x200B;

4:10 - Be detached(react calmly to highly emotional circumstances) when practicing compassion and charity without regard to appearances, without regard to form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or any quality of any kind.  

&amp;#x200B;

6:08 - All forms are illusive and unreal.

&amp;#x200B;

7:54 - Discard all arbitrary notions of the existence of a personal self, of other people, or a universal self.  But also discard any notions of the NON EXISTENCE of a personal self, other people or universal self.

&amp;#x200B;

8:30 - Discard not only all conceptions of your own selfhood, other selves, or universal self, but ALSO discard all notions of the non existence of such concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

9:03 - All of the above statements are like a Raft used to cross a river.  Once the river is crossed (you realize you are in the state of enlightenment), you don't need to think about any of these ideas or concepts anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

9:37 - No independently existing object of mind called the highest most fulfilled enlightened mind.  Because there are no separate independent things. Neither is nor is it not.

10:34 - Enlightenment is realized through an internally intuitive process. 

(like laughing at a joke)

&amp;#x200B;

12:16 - A true disciple who enters the stream of enlightenment doesn't see himself as a separate person entering any stream.  He doesn't even consider the concept at all.  He doesn't differentiate himself from others and has no regard for name shape sound odour taste touch or any quality can truly be called a disciple who's entered the stream.

&amp;#x200B;

12:55 - No passing away or coming into existence.  There is no one returning and no one not returning. 14:31

&amp;#x200B;

15:18 - A paradise cannot be created nor can it not be uncreated ??

Develop a mind that is in no way dependent upon sites sounds smells tastes sensory sensations or any mental conceptions.  Develop a mind that does not rely on anything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

22:44 - Buddhas discard all arbitrary conceptions of form and phenomenon, transcended all perceptions, and penetrated the illusion of all forms.

&amp;#x200B;

24:34 - Disciples should leave behind all distinctions of phenomenon, and not allow the mind to be evoked by the senses, sound, odors, flavours, sensory touch or any other qualities.  Stay independent of any thought that arises in your mind.  

&amp;#x200B;

30:38 - Help lead all beings to the shore of awakening but after they have been liberated, know that in truth not a single being has been liberated.  Because if a disciple cherishes the idea of a self, a person, a living being or a universal self, then that person is not an authentic disciple.  Why? Because there is NO independently existing object of mind called the highest most fulfilled awakened mind.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*33:15 - A true disciple knows that there is no such thing as a self, a person, a living being or universal self.  All things are devoid of selfhood or individuality.

&amp;#x200B;

38:40 - When you attain perfect Enlightenment you will feel as if nothing has been acquired.

You will come to the realization that you were always in that state.  It is neither a high state or a low state.  It's the state that you're in right now yet you don't have the wisdom yet to realize that you are already in it and were always in it.

&amp;#x200B;

39:45 - Be ethical and kind knowing there is no distinction between yourself and the selfhood of others. Practice kindness and charity without attachment.

&amp;#x200B;

48:53 - Your existence is very much like your existence in a dream.  Your dream self is not the real you.  It is a creation of your mind, much like all the objects and the people in that dream.",0
"I made an **[app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UnjinxApps.brainWaves&amp;referrer=present)** to help users to build and maintain regular meditation habits in a playful and interactive way. This app lets you start a meditation session and set a goal for how long you want to meditate. The app doesn't let you use your phone or even move it while the session is going on, or else the session is ended. The whole process from setting up the session to informing about the end is guided by a voice based virtual assistant.

Users get points for completing sessions which can help them level up. You can create a streak by holding a meditation session at least once every day, and there are different badges for milestones such as five days streak or twenty days streak. There is also a leaderboard with weekly, monthly and overall section where the users with the highest score in that time period are shown.

The app also has ambience sounds as well as a set of the most well-known binaural beats for those interested in it to help users get into the state of mind they want to reach.

I would really love any feedbacks about the app to help improve it!

"I’ve recently started meditating. As a result, I’m now aware of the fact that my mind basically runs nonstop. I’m constantly thinking about something, and usually that something is some far off person or thing or scenario. And to be honest, this newfound awareness is kind of driving me mad. Have any of you experienced this at the beginning of your meditation journey? If so, how did you deal with it?",0
I’m thinking of going to a Vipassana retreat next month and was wondering if any Muslims have attended any in the past. What was your experience like? We’re you able to complete your daily prayers?,0
"So my recent struggles are with remaining in the ""enlightened"" state as long as possible. Maybe I'm using the expression ""enlightened""  a bit exaggeratedly, but for me it's the good description of the state I'm in.  I managed to enter this state a few times and the best explanation of it is total freedom. Your thoughts pass through you and don't represent anything significant to you, you feel a space and distance from them, it feels like your actions and everything externally is being manifested by some higher intelligence, you feel really connected to the outside world, you can enjoy life in every moment, in every sight you see, sound you hear etc. It's like a constant state of flow. And every new time I was able to enter this state of being, the 'feeling' was more intense than the previous time, I could feel I'm in it deeper than before. The problem is, when I'm in that state, after a while I'm channelling a lot of positive thoughts and emotions from which is hard to distant yourself and not get caught into them. Also, as time passes some kind of undercover fear arises, a fear from losing this blissful state of being I'm currently in. I started meditating 9 months ago and been doing it regularly for around 4 months. I do it 1/2 times per day for around 15 minutes on average and I've gotten to the point where I can use the concepts from meditation in every day life so I can remain present and in the right state. My opinion is that I'm on the right track and I should continue to do what I'm doing, but I would love to hear from someone who had a similar experience or has an advice to give :)",0
"hey all!

i recently tried a couple of meditation apps (have been using headspace since the beginning of the year, but wanted to see what else is out there).  


the apps i have been comparing for a while now are 10% happier, waking up, headspace and calm. i summarized all the differences here: [https://youtu.be/6MVGJ50d8S4](https://youtu.be/6MVGJ50d8S4)

**10% happier:** high quality content, lots of lectures and courses available; goes pretty deep into spiritual areas that are only loosely related to meditation. unfortunately pretty pricy though once the week-long trial period runs out

**waking up:** app by famous author and neuroscientist sam harris; also extensive lectures and courses as well as guided meditation. the subscription costs as much as it does for 10% happier (100 dollars/year). has a mediation timer as well.

**headspace:** offers less courses and lectures than the previous apps; instead it focusses on guided meditation to a variety of different topics. the one guiding through the meditation has a great voice for it (at least i think so, haha). the subscription is also rather pricy, but in combination with spotify you get a discount. 

**calm:** bit different focus than the others. it sees mediation mostly as a tool to calm down and unwind, but offers other tools for that as well, such as calming sounds, bedtime stories and exercises for your breath. quite a lot cheaper than the other apps, while offering more variety. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure there are plenty of other apps out there worth trying, but those were the biggest names that i heard of. Do you agree? :)",0
"I would like to make a point about smartphones in general and I think it offers a different perspective on whether or not to meditate with an app.

Most people seem to be aware of the concept of 'here and now'. 

The opposite of 'here and now' is 'there and then'.

The perfect symbol for 'there and then' is the smartphone. It is the device that is ALL ABOUT 'there and then'. It is the exact opposite of 'here and now'. 

We don't use our phone to be 'here and now', we use it to connect to the 'there and then'. 

We use it to see what is happening elsewhere, to connect to people who are elsewhere, to look up the past, the possible future... if the mind was a device, it would be the smartphone. 

Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't use smartphones...

But meditation to me seems to be the perfect moment to turn off the 'there and then'-device just for a while.

There are many ways to let us know when the time we choose to meditate is up, if we want that.Timers, watches, church bells in the distance, etc.

A lot of people seem to think that as long as the phone is on airplane mode everything is fine and in that case using an app is also no problem. 

I can't say they are wrong. But I would like to present the other view which is that we have the 'there and then'- device turned on ALL DAY LONG.

So why not make a point and turn it off for whatever time we allocate to meditation?",0
"Can someone help me how to start meditating. I read here that it's not good to use apps, so what is the alternative , how to start, what program should I follow?",0
"Like the title states I recieved this Mala for my birthday ( wish I could post a photo of it, it's made out of the most beautiful stones) I'm wanting to start incorporating it into a meditation practice. Does anyone have experience using one and what are your thoughts on this?",0
"Hey everyone,  


This is not a traditional meditation, more like a safe astral experience in the tools that meditation teaches. The astral world has taught me so much I decided to slowly make series on how to do it yourself. It's all guided so you just relax and enjoy the experience. All that's needed is an open heart. It is also designed for you to meet higher beings during it so if that's a thought you don't like than don't listen to it.  


Have a wonderful day,

"I maybe totally wrong here but after month's of trying to meditate I've started noticing changes. I attend AA and in some meetings we take turn to read from the Big Book. I'm not very confident and I find reading difficult. The difficulty comes from my mind made story. Before I start to read I compulsively start to have this debilitating self talk. The chatter in my head says all sorts of negative things which of cause gets me nervous but it was like I associated with the self talk, it was part of me. Today I'm sat in my meeting about to read and I noticed the voices starting to happen. But this time i had the awareness and space to acknowledge the thoughts then take me my attention away from them and back on to been present. It felt extremely liberating and I was less nervous about reading after this.

Does this make sense?",0
"&amp;#x200B;

I've been meditating for almost 4 years now, can't say it has been consistent, but its been in steady enough for me teach me a lot about myself and the power of consciousness.

Initially, meditation was a form of relaxation from the busy and hectic mind and it was calming and just felt good, this was when I was 13/14, I didn't know much about mindfulness or the power of now and just thought it was a good stress reliever.

Several months down the line, i stopped because i got bored/lazy but this was the next big epiphany for me. I realised how observant and disciplined i had become, not because i had mediated but when i *stopped* meditating thoughts and emotions were leaking out of me constantly.

So I resumed to practise this disciplined and observant state to soften my reactions/action/thoughts and emotions and it has made me a changed man. I can see the world through an eagles eye, and i realise that all my past worries was just an illusion from the future/past.

3 years down the line and I'm still practising, not consistently yet but enough to make me happy and fulfilled.

At this point in time (16) I understand the healing/growing properties of mediation through present consciousness and focus on the individual muscles, the complete freedom and happiness that comes with living in the still present, observing the pain body through meditation to understand any form of pain which has helped me through tougher times and I've been in love with books about mindfulness in the past few years.

My mind is still and calm and the best part is I'm in complete and utter control of my universe I can handle any walls or barriers just through perception to free myself of the so-called 'problem'. It's been a humbling journey.

This might've interested or helped some of you, but I just felt the need to share this quiet experience and hear feedback.

**Is there any of you that have had a similar experience, how has it been?**

**Is there another path that I can take a look at that you know of?**

So a couple of technical questions that I have encountered so far: \[so I just sit 2-3 times per day for 10 mins\]

[www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ08yx1LBzc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ08yx1LBzc)

\- for example in the above guideline vid it says ''focus on the blank'' where I assume the ''blank'' is the same ''thing'' as the ''murk'' known from Kasina meditation - is that correct? (I dont see any other option for it to be something else, really)

\- When I am to ''focus'' how this should be done from the technical point of view, as the ''blank'' is just a collection of white black grey etc dots , like a TV static noise when you put the screen on an empty channel

(I tend to look past it or maybe ''in between'' the dots)

\- When I am refocusing on the blank, my eyes tend to do physical movements. Sometimes I have to consciously move the gaze upwards because otherwise my eyes start to open (My left eye doesnt close 100% - some sort of genetic malfunction ;) my father had the same trait) -is this okay

\- Saliva swallowing - this is unavoidable but it tends to ruin deeper concentration, any advice?

\- Tongue posture? On the roof of my palate?

I'd be grateful for your time and answers - let today fill you with peace and happiness :) Namaste",0

"Hello good people.

So I have been doing meditation on and off for the past year and a half , and I am a noob.

My motivations are to be a more calm person , a person that can separate logic from emotion and see clearly in any situation and I feel that meditation can provide me with just that.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is , I have some issues regarding mediation that I need some help with.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Position - I've researched some guides and they pretty much all say to sit straight without anything to lean on , I find that to be very difficult as my back is starting to hurt after 7 minutes, sitting at the half lotus position my feet begin to hurt and begin to go numb , that pretty much distracts me as I focus on trying to realign my body for better comfort rather than focusing on the nothingness. Do I really need to sit straight or can I lean on something?
2. Distractions - I have ADHD , keeping my mind numb and empty is hard enough as it is but distractions.. well they distract me easily, unfortunately I have no better place to conduct my meditation.. ear plugs or headphones are considered bad habits , but are they really bad?
3. Duration - I don't really know how much time I should conduct my meditation but I've found that 15 minutes are the best medium for me as anything above that is hard to maintain , is that a good time to start with?",0

" 

Over the past five years I have been diving deeply and consistently into the nature of reality and myself. They're both the same thing. I have had several deep and very profound and indeed life changing nondual and psychedelic experiences at this point. I understand that everything in the totality of existence is all fundamentally and inexorably one. I have traveled to places within consciousness that are beyond the human imagination. I have had my sense of self and eradicated and reformed several times now. Looking into the viewport of infinity is indeed breathtaking beyond all comprehension. You really are absolutely infinite and so beautifully glorious beyond what our bodies and brains are physically evolved to comprehend right now.

However there is something within me that is seemingly contently disinterested with phenomenological existence. I do not want to play this game anymore. I feel like no matter what I experience in this life, no matter where I go there will still always be a part of me that is just over the experience of existing as an individuation of consciousness at any level whether it be at a human level, bacterium level or godlike cybernetic alien level it’s all not the absolute truth, just more of this multiversal, multidimensional game of exploratory consciousness.

After I live my life and die there is a very strong feeling at the “core” (there is no core) of my consciousness that I never want to reincarnate in any way. While that is an ego driven statement I feel that there is something within myself that this is coming from a place of much deeper much more comprehensive inner standing and understanding of phenomenological existence and it’s alternative merging COMPLETELY into God consciousness so fully that any hope or possibility of incarnation into the realm of form is entirely extinguished. No thought no mind, no form no play, simply infinite incomprehensible nothingness, the purest expression of God.  

Over the past year a feeling has arisen within myself that wants this life of this specific individuation of consciousness to be the last physical expression that this individuation of consciousness ever experiences. The feeling and sense of relief is what I long for. I long for the ending of all experience by this individuation. The thought of an I experiencing reality no longer is the all encompassing thing that it once was. Now the idea of an I experiencing reality seems so superficial and somewhat shallow in a sense. I enjoy life and its many phenomena but I can so clearly see ( at an increasing rate) the illusion of all of the realm of form.  

Expression, experience and phenomenological existence go together. And there is such a powerful longing within my energetic composition to just have relief from being, relief from form, relief from experience I feel like I have done this so many times. I feel that I have played this game an infinite number of times. Now there is a tiredness to it all. I am all,every subatomic particle, every atom, every cell, every organism in the multitude of multiverses every object in all of existence. I am the infinite Holon. I am immortal, timeless, and infinite in every way. Yet and still within this body, within this specific individuation of consciousness, within this trans-temporal energetic being I feel a strong urge to never want to return to this place. It matters not what form consciousness takes it all boils down to this. Same shit different form. You are God experiencing itself in every way that there is and isn't.

After you have seen into infinity and lived in that place all of the forms become trivial they are no longer something to go after or to awe at when gazed upon. Its all infinite and there are never-ending forms but it all becomes ‘predictable’. You predict the outlandish and the mundane to the point where it becomes all just “meh” at a certain point of being blasted into infinity so many times. Viewing and being the infinite myriad of forms organisms, technologies, energies eventually it reaches a point of simply a pretty existential first person light show. The illusion is seen through and compared to truth the realm of forms and limitation becomes shallow in its substances.

The transcendence of survival is a necessary place to come to in this work and an inevitable point. I have not transcended survival and am still subject to it’s whims but there are times ( and they are becoming increasingly more common) where I can get into states of consciousness where in those moments I would be 100% OK with dying. However I am only 22 years old and thus I would like to complete my bucket list before I leave this place and I have so much work to do on myself in this life; and so much more fun to have; and so many more things to explore. I do not hate life I enjoy it and all of it’s beautiful weirdness but it’s illusory nature no longer has the same charm and allure as it had before in my perception. The world of form is BS and while it is truth on a relative level it will never be the absolute truth due to the fact that life is navigating forms, whether they be physical or nonphysical. It is because of this why “I” (at a level beyond ego that is inexplicable to me currently) want out of this game at all levels permanently.

You could incarnate into any multitude of alien species, Tryptamine entities, light beings, demigods, lichens, molds, insects, bacterium. While it is all you exploring and experiencing yourself once complete nondual awareness is had this experiencing looses it’s allure. It doesn't matter what form you take anymore. The destination and “point” of it all is the same. Simply put ULTIMATE UNION WITH GOD. This means a complete secession of all types of form and all types of experience, it is the embodiment and paradox of absolute nothingness. Not nonexistence, because God is infinite and thus nonexistence cannot exist; but nothingness in the sense of no longer being an individuation of consciousness bound to form and experience of any and all kind. It is this secession which is the omega point of this creation of this game.

 According to Buddhism the entirety of the realm of form is suffering in some way. This is Samsara. Nirvana is the release of this and the permanent secession of the individuated conscious experiencing of phenomenological existence. Absolute union with God. No more false boundaries, no more illusions. Just the simple truth.

All incarnation is an infinitely intelligent yet amnesiac God exploring to know its infinite self. However there comes a point where for individuations this experiencing of fundamentally illusory forms is no longer necessary for understanding. There is a transcendent something beyond being, beyond phenomena. Phenomenological existence is not the only way that God can know itself. However it is the only way that we can know ourselves. As lifeforms we highly value life to the point of delusion. I have no way to back up what I am about to say here; but life and the totality of phenomenological existence in my experience feels like a preliminary training ground for something else. This place is illusion and with illusion comes pain and suffering in one way or another. At the end of the day all holons of existence especially organisms organisms “want” to be happy, and to know that they are God. I do wonder if there will be a point (Yes I know time does not truly exist) where all individuations of consciousness in the totality of phenomenological existence will realize and embody God consciousness and this section of the game will end. It’s just a thought I have sometimes. I know that God is infinite and thus I am infinite.",0

So I already know the answer to my question. How do you meditate every day? Well, you sit down and you meditate. Every day. No exception.

"OK so as I’ve had medication which helps a little bit (but I try to avoid because of ramifications and to avoid a tolerance so it works better when I truly need it) I’ve noticed just practicing being mindful throughout the day helps.  My biggest trouble was being able to sit down and do math, but I’ve gotten a little better at doing it. I found that studies have proven 52 minutes of work and 17 minutes of break is beneficial for most people. Ive tried the 25 minute Pomodoro but it doesn’t help me as much as the 52 min on 17 min off.  In my 17 min off I was planning on doing 10+ min meditation at least 3 times a day to help with my patience and being able to focus.  I’m highly active so I’m not too worried about getting to jittery or impatient to walk outside as I already do that in my breaks .  Do you guys think adding meditation 3+ times a day is worth it or it is better to just do it once or twice a day morning and before bed? I kind of think more is better when it comes to meditation as long as you’re not getting worn out by doing like a full hour.",0
"1. Open your jaw just so that your teeth aren't touching, close your eyes so that your eyelids are completely smooth and unwrinkled, tilt your head into a neutral position so that you are looking straight ahead, and relax any tension in your cheeks, forehead, the inside of your ears, and your neck.



2. Take a breath deep and slow enough so that you can feel the satisfaction of exchanging the carbon dioxide in your blood for the oxygen in your breath.



3. Examine how it feels to be angry. More specifically, what does your body and mind feel like that lets you know that you are angry (or whatever emotion) in the first place? Where do these feelings appear? Maybe your chest, or throat, or muscles, or maybe somewhere more abstract. Just try to feel as many of the physical and mental sensations that come together to form the emotion.



4. At this point you might realize that anger has certain physical signatures, such as clenched jaw, furrowed brow, narrowed eyes, increased respiratory rate, etc. You might realize that it's actually hard to stay angry without the constant background of its physical markings.



5. Try and notice your most immediate next thought. Is it an image, or words, or or memory? What of? Whatever it is, in my experience it tends to take a second or two for the thought to appear. And so for those milliseconds before it does, I can't honestly say that I ""feel"" angry. Because in the absence of the physical and mental sensations that define it,  can it actually be there? 



How can you be angry if you don't or can't feel anger? 



It's gotten to the point for me where relaxing my face and taking a breath (step 2) is all it takes to release my anger. It can even enhance feelings of satisfaction and gratification, for example if I'm walking in the sun after having been in an air conditioned room for too long.



Hopefully this is helpful for someone.",0

"When you feel that sudden urge to scratch an annoying itch, or when you feel that something catches your eye, or when you consider giving in to a craving for a bad habit. When anything arises that seeks to distract you from the real, important nature of being present in the world, ask yourself this:

Will this change anything? Will I be better off after doing this?

Will scratching that itch change your position in the world? Or, will it condition you to be at mercy to the slightest annoyance from your body, will it by all likelihood make this itch stronger?

When a distraction appears, ask yourself whether you will truly gain from giving in to it’s warm and shallow reassurance. The answer is no. Scratching that damn itch won’t change a thing, and being aware of this allows you to remove its power. Now you’re in control.

We are all aware that the clock is ticking, our deaths await. So you can remember that every time a distraction arises you have one single choice: do you allow yourself to forget, or do you make every effort to stay aware of how precious the present is.",0

"I have been slowly building up the courage to do a month-long meditation retreat after a recent breakup. I realized that I want to continue to find myself and this is one of the things I am doing to figure that out! I am also someone who likes extremeness in most things I do. I have never gone to a meditation retreat, I am not going to back down or change my mind, and I meditate daily for 10-20 minutes. The most I have regularly meditated in the past was 20 minutes up to an hour.

I will be camping in a Kodiak tent, bring my own food, and make a trip at the 2-week mark for more food.

"Hi folks,

Long story short, I've been practicing meditation for awhile and lately have had some interesting changes. I practice the Ananda mandela often ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgFF0jewIiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgFF0jewIiM)), and as i've continued to do over some years I've grown completely use to my hands clamming, feeling magnetized to the floor, raging with vibrating energy, etc.

The last few months however, i've slowly been getting this electric-like, popping/cracking happening in my chest, like an electrical current jumping back and forth from my lungs? Last night I got much deeper than usual and it happened non-stop the whole session, although I just allowed this to happen to try to make sense of it, yet still can not tell if its healing or harming.

I read ""Qigong Meditation: Embryonic Breathing by Jwing-Ming Yang a few years ago and understand that it's very possible to direct qi in a damaging direction, but the book didn't really describe this feeling and i'm not trying to direct a mass of energy flow, moreso just stimulating my overall body. I know I should practice traditional qi-gong, but that's a whole different ballpark and even if I did, I'm sure this ""thing"" will persist at least until I learn how to collect and store qi in the dantien properly.

I'm a man of science and reason ( also kind of a hippie), and although there isn't much peer-reviewed double blinded studies for this kind of stuff, I'm hoping someone can help point me in the right direction. For all I know, I might be blowing up nerves or arterioles.

\*edit: I also breath very forceful sometimes, but only when I get into a rhythmic trance.",0

"I've been meditating for a little bit off and on the past few years. Sometimes once every day. Sometimes once a month.

Anyways, I listen to dark piano (cuz I'm an edgy fuck), and focus on breathing in and out. Anytime my mind wonders off I go back to focusing on breathing. I'm slightly slouched, with my face pointing to the floor. My left hand just kinda leaning on my right hand on the floor. (Hard to explain hand positions.)

I'll look up how your supposed to do it, but answers are always so different and telling me I'm doing it wrong.

When I have something to do, I just try to return my focus to that when my mind wanders, but what about when there's nothing important to focus on, like in a waiting room or on a plane, or whenever I'm walking somewhere - What do I do when there's nothing to pull my focus away from my negative thoughts?",0

"I have been practising meditation (on and off at times) for roughly 2 years. 

Over the past month, I have been meditating 30+ minutes a day. 

I don't know what it is, but it's feeling a bit pointless. I keep questioning myself as to whether I am doing it right and whether it is doing anything to help me. 

There are now times where focusing on my breath makes me feel a bit anxious. Maybe I am trying too hard? I also find it hard to keep my natural rythym of breath. When I focus on my breath, I can't help but control it and it feels unnatural. 

Sometimes I find it easier to focus on feelings in my body (energy in my hands), but is this proper meditation still? I feel like if I am not focusing solely on my breath I am not doing it right. 

Can anyone offer any advice for my issues and to help me rejuvenate my meditation practise?",0

"Why do some tutorials about meditation for beginners say that ""when a thought arises, simply put your attention back to your breathing"", while for more experienced meditators there are tutorials for letting go from past traumas(this is an example)?SO why telling the beginners not to distract yourselves wile meditating, while the more advanced ones are working (so thinking?) on their feeling of jealousy for example?

I've also found [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/TssX4fAa59s?t=338) about concentration/ aka being Mindful, with the exact timestamp of the moment he says the thing about bringing your attention when the mind wanders. I've followed it and now I'm really like ""In the Moment/fully aware of the present moment"".

"Hey all,

I've been using Headspace for the past 90 days after reading through most of Eckhart Tolle's 'The Power of Now', and try to remain mindful throughout the day. I feel that not thinking has been working wonders for me, especially for anxiety, depression, and socialising.

The only thing is, I'm not aware that I'm present? I feel like I've jammed myself in some paradigm that's left me unaware of being aware of my surroundings. 

So for example, I'm not aware of my thoughts, which seems to be subconsciously taking me towards a reliance on alcohol and cigarettes.

After abstaining from weed, today I finally gave in to smoking with friends as I'm travelling back home in the upcoming week and I'm not gonna see my friends for a long time. 

Well shit, did I have some deep thoughts. My mind is replaying all of the stupid stuff I've done under the guise of not caring because I'm ""present"". Now, I'm not saying being presence is bad in the slightest. What I am saying is that unless you're completely aware that you're tapped into those physical senses, then your life will consist of nothing but stimulations. 

I feel unmotivated, unambitious, and focused on the wrong things in life. It feels like I'm stuck in the matrix, despite believing not to be.

If not for the weed, it would've taken a long time pick up on this shit. That being said, it might be worth to point that that justification of weed is what has brought be back on many occasions; developing dependence. 

How can I maintain an awareness of my own mind when I'm so focused on everything other than what's going on in my head. My feeling towards people is apathetic, which I thought meditation would've helped with. 

The alcohol &amp; smoking stops from now on, but what's the best way to get myself back on track to what I want to do?",0

This time the meditation was different. I felt much more focused and aware. But what I have never experienced was the “release” of emotions and other stuff inside me.  It felt like things I had stuffed down deep inside we’re leaving me.  It was a 20 minute meditation. I’m tempted to try a much longer session, like 1 hour. Not sure if that’s a good idea. So basically I’m asking what was it that I experienced?",0

"I often find it difficult to motivate myself to do sitting meditation not because I find it unpleasant (I've done hour-long sits with no problem) but because I already spend so much of my day doing various sitting activities that the idea of sitting *even more* is unappealing to me; it can be a lot more appealing to do (Mahasi-tyle) noting while I am walking or cycling because it gives me a chance to move around.

So my question is, is there an optimal balance between sitting and moving meditation?  In particular, is there a minimal amount of sitting meditation that I need to get in order to make progress in noting, or does it not matter?",0

"my mindfulness practice seems to be progressing at a steady rate , which often feels very rewarding in day to day life. However im finding more and more im unable / lack the motivation to talk to people that ive known for a very long time. I feel this is because im becoming better at being present in the moment , however if i am totally present , speaking to people often feels very pointless as to me things seem right just the way they are . 
I feel people may say that this is a good thing as i no longer feel the need to be someone im not and that i shouldn’t feel forced to speak to people when i dont want to, however , this makes me very unsociable most of the time in social situations, which i feel is stopping me from getting the most out of my life . 
I am becoming very unsociable at work as i no longer try to make conversation with the people i work with, which can make other people uncomfortable. I feel calm and peaceful most of the time, which is nice , but im often missing the way interacting with other people used to feel before i ever started meditation. 
Is this a usual stage in mindfulness practice ? i am currently reading the book ‘mindfulness in plain english’ which makes a lot of sense while i am reading it , but i sometimes feel some of the concepts just arent applicable to society , which worries me as it is not my aim to become a monk living in solitude . 
i want to live life as the real ‘me’ as mindfulness claims is the goal of unlocking, but what if the real me is unable to survive in this world and i may be better off shaping my ego to suit what makes me happy by trying to connect with those around me rather than becoming comfortable with just being .

"How to Meditate for Beginners: let’s get you started!

You’ve read about the many benefits of meditation, you’ve got friends or family members who swear by their 20 or 45 minutes a day, you’ve heard celebrities say they couldn’t live without it, and now you’re ready to take the plunge! But wait, there’s a hitch, you think. What, exactly, are you as a rank beginner supposed to be doing?

&amp;#x200B;

That’s why we’re here! And we’re so glad you’ve joined us! Read on for some basic mindfulness meditation instructions that will get you sitting in no time flat.

&amp;#x200B;

What not to expect

Want to be like those memes of blissful mediators by the sea who seem to be communing with the universe with nary a care – or a misplaced thought – in the world? Not going to happen. Want to sit down, set your timer, and enjoy a 20-minute thought-free bliss bubble? Nope. Hoping your chakras will immediately begin whirling and twirling? Unlikely. Think you’ll start levitating and float away, leaving this mundane existence behind you? Implausible, thank heavens. Meditation is much more down-to-earth than that.

What to expect

[Meditation](https://vinyasayogaacademy.com/200-hours-yoga-teacher-training-in-india.php) is about connecting with the completeness of the here and now. The way we teach it, it’s very grounded. You sit straight and still, observe, let go, come back, and discover the rich fullness of the present moment. Since you’re not giving in to distractions, you have the space to connect with mind’s creativity and become aware of the stream of thoughts and emotions it produces. And what are you going to do about these thoughts and emotions? You’re going to acknowledge them without giving in to fascination or frustration, and let them simply go back to where they came from, like a wave that arises and naturally and inevitably merges back into the sea.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would you do such a thing? Because meditation is calming. It’s sane. It comes with a host of benefits for body and mind. It will help you discern which of the thoughts and emotions that arise in your mind are worthy of your attention. It puts you back in touch with your basic goodness. The qualities you develop through mindfulness and awareness meditation make your world a better place. And so much more.

&amp;#x200B;

How to meditate – for beginners

Meditation is popular, and there are many good meditation techniques for beginners and more advanced practitioners alike

Find a quiet place and settle on a comfortable chair, bench or cushion.

You may want to decide how much time you’d like to devote to sitting in the beginning. Consistency is key. Even a few minutes every day will get you off to a great start.

Take a moment to check in with your posture. Try to find a position that allows you to keep your back straight.

Set aside your industrious conceptual mind. Breathe. Tune in to the feeling of being present. Take stock of your physical presence as you breathe.

Note physical tensions and mental concerns. Acknowledge them with kindness and invite them to relax and release.

Tune in to the process of breathing. Feel the breath in your belly. Don’t concern yourself with analyzing or modifying your respiration, just feel it and center your awareness on the web and flow.

Breathe in: you’re aware that you’re breathing in. Breathe out: you’re aware that you’re breathing out.

When you notice that your mind has wandered, gently but firmly bring it back to the breath.

This is mindfulness: training in awareness, acknowledging, letting go and coming home to the breath and the present moment.

When you are ready to end your meditation session, relax, stretch, and enjoy a moment of gratefulness before picking your busy life back up where you left it, renewed and refreshed.

Check out our video on Take Your Seat – how to find an upright and comfortable posture for meditation:

Even practicing a couple of minutes of mindful awareness helps us put things in perspective, check in with our feelings and reboot. Some people enjoy taking mini-meditation breaks at work or at school; others like to devote a period of time every day to meditate alone or with others.",0
"Hello everyone. Tomorrow there’s a concert that I’m going to attend, that my ex fwb will be there with his new girl. I haven’t seen them together in person, but just by pictures I get really emotional (I feel super bad). 

I thought about not going, but that would imply that I’m running away from this situation

AND I also thought that it would be a great opportunity to prove to myself that I can handle discomfort and be okay. 

The thing is, my anxiety is almost making me completely give up (I haven’t had the symptoms yet but the thoughts are coming and Really getting to me) saying that when I get there I’ll feel super bad, that I might get s panick attack or something.

So, I started a plan to meditate today for 20 minutes, tomorrow morning 20, afternoon 10 and 10 at night before going to the show. I don’t know that if doing this I’m running away from feelings instead of letting them be. I’m kinda confused

I then think of any memories which i have had particular problems with - memories that were particularly painful or embarrassing and rub them out with the eraser.

The sensation is accompanied by an erection, risen heart rate and deep breaths. The sensation eventually becomes so intense that I start focusing on it rather than my breath and then it subsides. Im not sure what it is but if It happened recently I find myself grasping for it alot and when it does happen it disrupts my session. Any explanation or solution would be helpful. Thanks.",0

"This morning I needed to clear my mind, I found a “thank you” affirmation video which was an hour long. It wasn’t a meditation video but I found myself breathing/relaxing as if it was. 

It was repetitive, listing about 25 different things to be thankful for and then it repeated over and over again. “Thank you for my hands. Thank you for my feet. Thank you for ...” My mind didn’t stray and then I fell asleep during.

I started dreaming that I was in my workout clothes with my earpiece in and I could still hear the affirmations. I was putting groceries away and my husband came to the kitchen looking for a particular pan but it was dirty and he started complaining about it. I tried to take the earpiece out so I could talk to him but I couldn’t get it out and I couldn’t turn off my phone. 

He kept getting louder and I was upset and in my dream I began punching him in the face. He fell back and I grabbed and pulled at his hair. It was very violent. And all the while I’m trying to get the affirmations to stop. I get off of my husband and a naked man comes and stands in front of me and my husband accuses me of having a new man. This only makes me more angry and I start hitting him all over again. When I finally woke up the video had ended. I was out of breath and shaking. An hour later and I feel sick to my stomach.

### Abstract

### Purpose

This pilot study evaluated whether a brief, 5‐min single‐session of mindfulness meditation (MM) training could lessen cardiovascular and affective reactivity to speech and anger recall. Moreover, we tested if trait levels of perseverative cognitions (PCs) moderated these relationships.

### Methods

Participants completed online survey measures including PCs; thereafter, they completed a 5‐min resting baseline, 2‐min speech task, and 5‐min anger recall task while measures of BP were collected. The experimental group received a 5‐min MM training session before the resting baseline period.

### Results

Repeated measures ANOVA were conducted for condition (MM vs. control) and period (repeated: baseline, speech, anger recall) on blood pressure (BP). The MM group showed less systolic and diastolic BP reactivity during speech and anger recall than the control group. There were no effects observed for negative affect nor did PCs moderate the BP findings.

### Conclusion

Thus, even 5 min of MM training can have momentary cardiovascular benefits, having important implications for the training and implementation of MM programs.",0
"I just started meditating about 1 month ago. I begin to experience hallucinations. 
Not strong ones. 
I lay down in a dark room after a nice hot bath, covered up in blankets, blindfolded, headphones on with the music i discovered. 
At first i cannot seem to find peace, i am afraid that someone walks in and a stream of thoughts rushing through my mind for what feels like an eternity.
Then i begin to think if its even worth it, and when my timer is going of.
But suddenly i begin to be aware of my body.
My feet is buzzing.
My hands are buzzing.
I am aware of my breath.
A warm feeling spreads from my chest and through out my body.
I begin to feel weightless.
I cannot feel my feet.
I cannot feel my hands.
Next is that is feels like i am looking out through my eyelids. I begin to look around in the dark room. 
It's beginning to feel like an out of body experience and it's amazing, yet scary.

"Karma Keeps All of Creation in the Stream of Evolution to Higher States of Consciousness.


The Sanskrit word Karma means action.
The Law of Karma governs all actions to ensure that everything and everyone remain in the stream of evolution.
The Law of Karma states :
As you sow, so shall you reap.
As human beings we have thoughts.
These thoughts often lead to desires.
Then we perform actions to fulfill our desires.
The consequences of those actions, or the fruits of those actions, are determined by Natural Law.
The influences of your actions radiate out into the Universe and strike against everything.
At some point those influences will return to you:
They leave deep impressions in your mind.
These impressions lead to other thoughts, other desires, and other actions.
This is how Creation is evolved:
Through actions and consequences of actions;
Through all the activity here in the relative field.
The purpose of the Law of Karma is to keep all of Creation in the stream of evolution:
All human beings in some lifetime will experience Higher States of Consciousness.
Perhaps in this lifetime you desire to meditate with a practice that transcends the relative field:
To experience your Self by ItSelf referring to ItSelf;
Your Self That is Divine Being.
With repeated and regular referring to your Self in your Meditation Practice, you rise to That status of Divine Being;
To That status of Universal God.
Now you are freed from the bondage of Karma:
The influences of actions no longer leave deep impressions on your mind that lead to new actions.
You must live out the Karma you came into this lifetime with, but there will be no new Karma created for future lifetimes.
You are freed from the cycle of birth and death.
You are established in your Self.
You know your Self as separate from all the activity here in the world.
You no longer perform action.
You know all actions are performed by Natural Law.
This is the purpose of our lives as human beings:
To rise to That status of Divine Being;
To expand our happiness and fulfillment.
Do your Meditation Practice regularly and transcend repeatedly.
Rise to That status of Divine Being in this lifetime now.
Be your Self.

"I went through a traumatic event when I was a child, and it has recently come to the surface of my awareness and it's extremely difficult to not let it affect my entire reality. I haven't been officially diagnosed, but my therapist said that what I'm experiencing seems to fulfill the requirements for PTSD.

I was never great about consistently sitting for meditation, but I still felt mindful and calm throughout my days. However, when the trauma from my childhood resurfaced, mindfulness just increased any senses of anxiety, which just means that I have a lot of pain to work through. However, when I sit to meditate now, the anxiety builds up so quickly that I feel it physically, it is almost painful. It's almost like when I sit, I'm just mindfully placing my hand on a hot pan. I have a sense that sitting with the pain is what I need, but at the same time, I may need to do other things than just breathing through the pain.

I have seen some posts that meditation sometimes can exacerbate problems with trauma or PTSD in some cases. I usually do not ask for insight but maybe I should - anybody have some?",0

Why are they the hardest battles to fight despite us knowing they’re bad? Does mediation help with this? Fighting the urge, understanding the urge? I’m lost confused and hurt and I just want to understand how to fix this all. Thank you.",0
"Idk where else to post but meditation and chakra is somehow related afaik so here goes....

So I happen to know a friend of a friend share some same hippie vegan lifestyle interests.

We texted and I mentioned about ringing ears and insomnia. She then offer me advice on alternative healing. 

Also I’m agnostic and super skeptical nowadays and I think Chakra, Chi, TCM are very pseudoscientific.

I know she meant well but I also don’t wanna offend her in any other way. 

She keeps asking me if I’m feeling any better because she’s trying to “heal” me across the internet right now. 

I mean I can lie and tell her I’m feeling better I guess? But she’s selling “alkaline” water machine and I can’t really even already

Any advice?",0

"We get so caught up in our anxieties, remembering the past and trying to predict the future that we miss out on the only moment that matters, this one. 

Stop. Right now. 

Let yourself feel what it’s like to be present, non judgmentally and aware. Observe your thoughts, feelings and any sensations that arise. Then start bringing awareness to your breathing and the rise and fall of the stomach. 

Embrace it. The precious present.",0
"I’m planning to attend a holotropic breathwork workshop in a few months and have done enough research to grasp the idea behind and potential outcomes, which are the memories you can bring from deep subconscious to conscious level.

I have shared with my wife my plans yesterday and she asked a very valid question that I haven’t considered before - “will I be able to handle and process the things that I resurface?”

I know fairly little about my early childhood and I’m not quite sure that I’m equipped well enough to sort all this data later on.

"I am reading the Sound of Silence by Ajahn Sumedho right now and cams across a passage that helped me a lot just now. He says...
“When you’re identified on the level of ‘I am the body and I am my feelings, thoughts, and memories,’  you’re always limiting yourself, binding yourself to unsatisfactory conditions. These conditions can never satisfy you, because they’re changing. When you try to find security and permanent happiness in things that are forever changing, you’re going to be terribly disappointed”
HIGHLY recommend this text for everyone, particularly those who struggle with identifying on a personal level with their emotions, thoughts, and feelings perhaps a little too much.",0

I have been doing mindfulness as much as possible but I'm having trouble finding a good guided meditation app  that isn't going to cost heaps.  I just found one called insight timer.

"For years, I (29M) told myself  that I would start medidtating. And during those years I tried only a handful of times. It usually ended with confusion and great disappointment because I had no guidance on what I was doing, or how to properly practice meditation. 

Simultaneously, the last few years I've been (unknowingly) struggling  with my chaotic mind and my toxic impulses. 

Anyways, I'm now 19 days into Sam Harris's introductory meditation course through his Waking Up App, and I'm happy to say it's had a profoundly positive effect on my life. 

For the first time in about ten years I've been sober for 30 days and have also picked up cycling and have nearly 100 miles of riding this month.  

I'm not great at this yet, but I'm very happy to be moving my life in a positive direction. The power of this practice is truly mind blowing.

Anyways, I'm really curious to hear from anyone whose had a similar experience and how it continued to transform their bad habits.",0
"Hi everyone. I became interested in meditation as I watched ""The mind, explained"" in Netflix. I don't know where to start. Should I start with focusing on my breathing? How do I know if I'm succeeding or just trying hard? I think I *really need* meditation as I usually cannot organize my thoughts and worry *a lot*. I also find it hard to disconnect from the realities of life even when I go out on vacation. I feel like there is constant chaos in my mind. Do I need to visit monks in different parts of the world to learn ""surreal,true"" meditation? Or can I achieve it just at home? Are there specific forms/positions I should do to achieve mindfulness?

First of all, thanks for all the inspiration you guys have given me! It's really helped me continue my meditating journey.

So I've been meditating for about 1,5 years now and I've dealt with a lot of difficulties that occur while meditating that no longer bug me (not being able to sit still, getting sleepy etc.)


Now, I often have music in my head since I listen to a lot of music and also play instruments, but at times while I'm meditating it can be really distracting.

Does anyone experience this too? And how do you deal with it? I'd love to hear your experiences :)",0
"Although enlightenment is beyond thoughts and words, and speaking about it takes you further away from it, this to me is an interesting perspective and may be beneficial to some;

Enlightenment is like a fish in the ocean searching for the ocean.

Enlightenment is the very nucleus of our being; going to the core of our self and living our life from there. We all came into this world gifted with innocence but gradually, as we became more intelligent, our innocence was lost. We were born with silence but, as we grew up, lost the silence and were filled with words. We lived in our hearts and as time passed, we moved into our heads.

The reversal of this life passage is enlightenment. It is the journey from the head back to the heart, from words back to silence and regaining our innocence in spite of our intelligence. Although this may sound simple, it is actually a great achievement.

Knowledge should lead us rather to that beautiful point of unawareness and the realisation that the purpose of knowledge is ignorance. Yes, the purpose of knowledge is ignorance! The completion of knowledge ultimately leads to amazement and wonder, that which makes you aware of this existence. Mysteries are to be lived, not understood. One can live life fully in its completeness, in its totality.

Enlightenment is further that state of being unshakeable under any circumstances. Come what may, nothing can rob the smile from your heart. Going beyond the limited boundaries, and feeling ‘‘all that exists in this universe belongs to me,’’ is enlightenment.

Un-enlightenment is easy to define. It is limiting yourself by characterising your being along geographical, cultural or religious lines. It is like a child saying, ‘‘my dad is better than your dad,’’ or ‘‘my toy is better than your toy.’’ I think most people around the world are stuck in that same childish frame of mind: only the toys have changed.

Adults say, ‘‘my country is better than your country’’ or ‘‘my religion is superior to your religion.’’ A Christian will say, ‘‘The Bible is truth,’’ and a Hindu will say, ‘‘The Vedas are the truth. They are very ancient.’’ Muslims will say, ‘‘The Koran is the last word of God.’’ We attribute glory to something just because we are from that culture, not for what it is.

The whole evolution of man should be from being somebody to being nobody, and from being nobody to being everybody. This is enlightenment.

"Imagine a ball in front of you.
Imagine a ball of the most suitable size that you can think of most comfortably.
It can be about the size of a soccer ball, small bead and small dot, and it can be about the size of a huge universe.

The surface of the ball is so transparent that the contents of it can be seen very well.
Standing in front of the ball, looking inside, the ball seems to be filled with golden grains of sand.

Rubbing your eyes and looking closely into the ball once again, you see that the ball is filled with silvery liquid, not the golden grains of sand you saw before.

It seems certain that your body looking at the ball in front of the ball, the ball, and your consciousness that imagining all of this at this moment, are clearly separated as different entities.

Now imagine another ball.

You are in the ball, not outside the ball.
You were in the ball from the beginning, rather than entering it from outside the ball.
Your body and consciousness were born in the ball from the silver liquid in the ball.

Your body and consciousness are contained in the ball.
Your body and consciousness and the ball are exactly the same one, and in a sense the ball is contained in your body and consciousness.

In the ball, there is another being that has another body and consciousness that was born inside the ball.

Both you and the other being are contained in the ball.
Your body and consciousness, the body and consciousness of the other being, and the ball are exactly the same one, and in a sense the ball is contained in your body and consciousness, and the body and consciousness of the other being.

You and the other being are facing each other.

From your point of view, you are the main character of the ball, and you are looking at the other being.
From the point of view of the other being, the other being itself is the main character of the ball, and the other being is looking at you.

Your ball and the ball of the other being are not separate balls but the same ball.
You and the other being are experiencing the ball at the same time on each side and are connected to each other, include each other and are the same one.
The ball sees itself from the point of view of you and from the point of view of the other being.

You and the other being and the ball are all overlapped.
You selectively perceived you and the other being from the ball.
You are the silver liquid itself and the ball itself.

You can selectively recognize anything from silver liquid in the ball.

You can recognize the silvery liquid as a huge space surrounding you.
In this space, you can recognize that there are several buildings built and many people walking around you.

You can also recognize the buildings and those people's past and future.
You can recognize how the buildings were built and what kind of life those people are going to live.

You can return the perceptions back to the silvery liquid.
The spaces, buildings, people and time all disappear and the ball is only filled with silvery liquid.

You can also return recognition of silvery liquids.
The ball is filled with something, but it seems empty because it is not recognized.

You can also return the boundary of the ball that forms the shape of the ball.
The boundary between the inside and outside of the ball disappears and is not recognized.",0
"Ive been meditating for a month now and have been using the focus of the breath technique, with a mix of body focus and transcendental. The reason I got into meditation was of really bad anxiety and slight depression. I knew I had to do something and work on myself. Happy to say I have recovered a-lot! I would like to start tapping in to my ego... myself, during meditation. How would I achieve that during meditation, realizations that come to mind. Increasing the time you meditate?",0
"I have been practicing meditation daily for a little over a month now and am amazed at the dramatic shift in my mind, with the debilitating thoughts and anxiety decreasing every day. I noticed today after an uncomfortable conversation on the phone with my boyfriend that while I was able to calm my racing thoughts relatively quickly, my body became extremely tense, and is still feeling tense hours later. My sympathetic nervous system reacts instantaneously to a stressful event, much more quickly than I can even perceive. So before I even have a chance to be mindful, my shoulders are clenching, my throat is constricted, I become lightheaded, dry-mouthed, etc, etc. I'm guessing that my stress hormones start shooting full throttle and don't know when to start or stop. My question is, should I continue with my regular meditation practice (simple mantra meditation 15 min. 2x daily + occasional guided meditations) and hope for my sympathetic nervous system to catch on in time, or would you recommend adding another practice or guided meditation to help facilitate this shift?",0
"A lot of the posts here are asking about ""What do I do when experiencing negative thoughts?"" and the answers are always a feverish frenzy of ""Anchor to your breath"", ""Stay single pointed and concentrate awareness on your breath and they will fall just as they came"". These are correct answers and are what you should be doing.

Then a few other posts come about like ""What do I do when I'm experiencing POSITIVE thoughts?"" And suddenly all discipline is gone, answers like ""Enjoy them"" or ""Use them until it no longer serves you"" are instantly voted to the top. There are 2 major things wrong with that. 

First, there is  no discipline. How can you expect yourself to not stray from your breath during bad thoughts if you are not disciplined during good thoughts? You won't, and you'll be a slave to your thoughts until you develop that discipline. 

Second, if you are indulging in good thoughts ans avoiding bad thoughts, your mental state is therefore wholly affected by thoughts, which you have no control over, rather than your awareness and greater self. You can be at peace no matter what, but if you attach to your positive thoughts you constrict yourself on how much you really are abstaining from attachment, and it will only hinder you in the future.

If he truly wanted to see how to meditate there are 5 minute Youtube videos. If you read his comments he contradicts himself multiple times and see that he is actually just pushing misinformation rather then coming to this sub to learn something. I am not making this post as an attack but a message to everyone on this subreddit that this is not the place for this. We are meditating to reach our high selves. This isn’t a political or religious agenda center. He is spreading Islamophobia and I don’t see how that is acceptable in a meditation centered group. He is claiming he’s living in a Arab state where he would be “killed” for meditating. It has been cross posted to r/samharris.

I have asked him multiple questions about his responses that are contradicting everything he is saying with clever worded dodgy responses. I believe these people are working in groups and have throwaway accounts to push their agenda. If you don’t believe me you can easily see this guys responses, the misinformation he is spreading, the islamophobia he is spreading, the cross post they are pushing, the vague answers, the facts he is not acknowledging and the opinions he is pushing. Any well educated person can see this for themselves as I wish there is no more of this poor minded thinking.

"Being a calm and cool person is an extremely special trait which is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the hectic nature of our modern society. When a person is calm, his energy affects all the people around, bringing others an air of comfort and peace by making them feel that everything is going to be okay. A calm person is relaxed, assured, and stable, making him better capable of dealing with stressful situations and solving problems effectively and efficiently. Consequently, he gains the respect of others, is pleasant to be around, and abides joyfully in this world.

Today, I'd like to share two main ways to develop our inner calmness by highlighting how to increase our physical calm as well as our mental stillness.

&amp;#x200B;

**Physical Calm**

Because of our mind-body connection, the condition of our physical well-being has a significant influence on our feelings and emotions. If we can maintain a healthy body, our mind will benefit immensely, and we will feel an elevated sense of joy, calm and confidence, and overall positivity. We must always be mindful of the three basic yet vital aspects of a healthy body and monitor them daily. These three pillars of good health are: eating healthy, resting adequately, and exercising frequently. When we can manage these three things well, we will see a significant change in our mental well-being that in turn, leads to inner calmness. 

Furthermore, it is important to maintain good posture throughout the day to ensure the tension on our joints and muscles are properly distributed and that we keep our body parts in their rightful positions to minimize stress. Whether we are sitting, standing, or walking, our backs should always be upright, our shoulders should be pulled slightly back, and our necks should be comfortably rested with our gaze just a little lower than horizontal. We should always assume relaxed comportment and avoid tensing up our shoulders, jaws, necks, or legs. We can do this by practicing several rounds of mindful breathing every hour or whenever we can remember. We take a deep breath and fill our lungs up with a good dose of oxygen. Then on our out-breath, we send our body into relaxation by letting go of all the tension throughout our body that we have been carrying unconsciously. You can try it now for yourself to uncover just how much strain your body is carrying. After a few rounds, you are sure to feel a little more relaxed.

Every time we breathe in mindfully, we clear our minds of mental clutter and regain clarity of thought. And when we breathe out, we relax our bodies and let go of negative energies and emotional burdens that we've been carrying throughout. Over time, when our sleep, diet, and exercise is well managed, our physical posture is realigned, and we have regained mindfulness of our breathing, we will notice a sharp increase in our body's physical comfort. We will feel calm and relaxed wherever we are, whatever we are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mental Calm**

Because we cannot physically see our minds, it is easy to forget that it also needs taking care of. However, not everyone knows how to care for our mental well-being, and so in many cases, we end up doing things that instead bring it harm and suffering. The first thing we should realize is that our minds are just as delicate as our bodies and is equality susceptible to negative influences. We need to show it as much attention as we do to our bodies.

The first thing our mind needs is our attention. How we feel, what we think, our wants and needs, our joys and pains, we should all be attentive to them, moment to moment. Giving attention to our mental world is called mindfulness, and without this quality, no amount of effort will bring us calm, peace, and happiness. Just as a mother cares for her newborn, never leaving it from her side, we should care likewise for our minds. Mindfulness is another word for deeply listening to ourselves, while maintaining a gentle, kind, and attentive position. This is the highest form of self-love, which, when practiced profoundly, leads to unconditioned joy and fulfillment. 

When we begin listening to our minds and giving it the attention it deserves, we begin understanding what causes and conditions lead to certain effects and outcomes. For example, with mindfulness, we learn that hatred and anger create much stress, anxiety, discomfort, while kindness and open-mindedness lead to pleasure, ease, and delight. When we witness with mindfulness that wholesome qualities lead to inner peace and happiness, we will naturally begin doing more good and less bad. We learn to live life more harmoniously, generously, and lovingly. When we listen to our minds and give it what it wants and needs, we will inevitably develop a deep sense of calm and confidence.

But of course, mindfulness of our inner world may also lead to the discovery of negative emotions, suppressed memories, or even bad thoughts that bring us pain and sorrow. When this happens, we must fight the urge to turn away from our hurting mind, but instead, show it the great care and concern it needs most. The best way to deal with such situations is to realize that like everything else in the world, these thoughts, feeling and emotions are temporary, transient, and have the nature of arising and passing away. With this understanding, we develop patience which is the best virtue to help us manage unfavorable states. With a patient mind, we listen deeply to our pain, embrace it as a mother embraces her baby, and remind it that everything is going to be okay. 

When we develop mindfulness, patience, and wisdom of impermanence, we naturally give rise to great inner calm, because we learn how to create good states, how to manage bad ones, and realize deep down that no matter what happens, everything is going to be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

To realize our inner calm, it is important to establish healthy lifestyle habits, a healthy body, and a connection with our breath. This will inevitably bring a great sense of physical calm and comfort. To cultivate our mental calm and comfort, we must practice mindfulness, which is simply the practice of deeply listening to ourselves. Then, we create positive states by developing wholesome qualities like kindness, generosity, and empathy, while learning to manage negative states with patience and the understanding that all phenomena is conditioned and temporary by nature. 

If we can internalize these ideas into our everyday lives, we will naturally feel a deep sense of calm, joy and fulfillment, knowing that we have a way to deal with everything life throws at us, and at the end of it all, everything is going to be okay. I hope reading this has brought some benefit to you, and I sincerely pray that we all realize our inner calm, peace, and joy.

May we all live happily, healthily, and harmoniously, and work together to create a wholesome, vibrant, and joyful world for our families, friends, and all future generations.

"I've been meditating nigh on daily (20 mins first thing in the morning) for about 8 months now, and to my surprise I've found the most disruptive thoughts are the positive ones, which generally come in the form of being excited for and coming up with ideas/planning what I'm going to do for the day. While I'm stoked I have this problem (given that part of the reason originally approached meditation with the intent of confronting somewhat traumatic memories) a bigger part of the reason I approached meditation is due to the relationship between meditation the default mode network (the neurological seat of daydreaming/mind wandering).

As much as lurking on this sub has advised me against getting attached to any one sensation, I generally chase the dragon of getting into a state  where I am completely content with sitting there and having no desire to open my eyes and and engage in some random thing be it a random chore/starting my day/part of something I want to do today/do something with my gotdam phone.

I'm thankful that my default mode network is just living it's best life and giving me good ideas of shit to do with my time. However, throughout my life my daydreaming has been a source of chronic distraction and not getting ANYTHING done. I have started many things that could have been amazing if I actually maintained attention to them but instead I get distracted/lose inspiration/bored and leave a useless husk of an idea behind.

How should I treat thoughts that, while not meditating, I *should* sink my teeth into and take advantage of?

Thankyou for reading if you made it through!",0
"Okay guys, first of all I made sure I was grounded and said an Our Father prayer. I know my chakras are out of whack, and was starting with my root chakra. I used this meditation music  with a Bluetooth sleep mask. (https://youtu.be/vCpBSnYBTM0)

I'm breathing and doing well and like I mentioned in the title. That blue eyes thing formed.  And it didn't leave and I looked at it for a long time and then I opened my eyes, and it was still there.  I wasn't afraid until I started really thinking about it.  And then my brain started taking over and I asked for it to go away. 

Afterwards I have had pressure in the middle of my eyebrows.

What the heck did I just do, aww geez.🙄",0

A part of me believes people like david icke and joe rogan when they say were really like a frequency, and we really do live forever.

How does breathing help you gain access to a higher dimension?",0
"More like, modern examples, think (Mark Manson.. etc.) 

Not sure if I'm the only one, but I can't seem to break through this book.  It might be the jargon, using ""pain-body"" every 5 seconds.. (in my opinion).

"So I want to appologise in advance if this isn't where this sort of thing belongs and for any grammatical/spelling mistakes I've just finished work and am quite tired but want to get this off my chest.
 
I'm a care assistant and last friday an elderly man who i have only known a few months but had an instant connection with died during the night he was bed bound and for weeks it's been clear he's suffering, but he seemed to be holding on for his family i believe. On friday he said ""i bet you think it's sad I'm dying"" and i told him, no, i think it's sad that you're suffering, I find that the truth soothes more than a lie like yes but you are going to get better or something like that. That night we spoke a bit but i had a strong feeling he would die.

So during the night I had a dream and his being visited me at first it was just like a presence of him then a body and then he took on the form of his younger self and he had 3 dogs with him (dogs are what we bonded over) we spoke for what seemed an eternity even though there wasn't much actual conversation and it seemed like we were traveling through a void and at some point I told him it's time to let go and he did and he was happy and not scared. 

Now even though i know it was just a dream i still feel some guilt and confusion. Partly because I'm putting some blame on my death down to my conversations with him and partly because I'm worried that if it wasn't just a dream and he did visit me did i rob his wife and family of a visit they could have had? And lastly should i share this experience with them or is it more likely to cause more distress/suffering for the family I'm very fortunate to not of had to experience loss like this before so don't really know. 

does this perhaps belong in astral projection or something. anyway thanks you for reading this and apologies.",0
"Today for a while, I noticed a strong instant distinction between being mindful and not being being mindful. Now I know I have not been mindful for atleast 14 months. Atleast never been fully mindful, or in the way I experienced today . I have been more self concious then self aware because of this fact as well detached and highly Unconcious of life happening around me and have been facing a lot of stress and anxiety(also  newly founded PTSD from trauma  2 years ago). It's as if I couldn't be concious at all..I had so many control issues. I went to a 10 day Buddhist retreat and I wasn't mindful for a single moment.  We kept doing shamatha but I wasn't mindful in Shamatha, just thinking about my thinking (like they told)

Important: Now I know I am used to controlling my breath in an unnatural way from my head that is detaching and depersonalizing from the moment and everything happening around me(and this has become a strong ingrained pattern){makes sense?}.. But the few moments I was mindful, my breath was totally natural working according to its own accord. Is it so? Can someone help me understand why and how this was happening?

I never thought mindfulness is a mind full upto the brim.I misunderstood what real mindfulness is(thought I was being mindful but I was just living in a small part of my head, like it's said,""Some people die at the age of 25 and aren't buried until 75."" And I have been this person for so long."") Not anymore.

But now I know what I've been doing so wrong all this past year. 

The only problem, I can't get mindful again this evening. Idk how I struck upon it but it was magical and I was so much more aware of myself than my continuous anxious thought cycle, I wasnt a victim anymore.
I have to relearn this art.

"Pretty much said it all in the above haha. 
Just want to know if anyone else has felt this or any advice would be awesome. 
I ventured into this because I want to be kinder, calmer, more focused and not just struggle to get through my work day but actively love it and live in the moment. 
I use this app to teach me how to meditate and was meditating before work and after work to calm myself down and put my head in a nice headspace before I would go to work. I honestly felt like I saw the changes. I wasn’t engaging in any negative talk about work, I was stopping my need for energy drinks in the morning, I wasn’t so nervous going to work and worrying things wouldn’t work out... I’m sure you get the point. I just thought, wow this is so awesome. I’ve found a loophole in this life! I can do this! 
And then yes, as said above. It’s like I just rejected the morning from the get go. When my alarm went off, I was shaking it in anger. Then I angrily went downstairs, got in the shower and just cried. My boyfriend asked me what was wrong and I said I didn’t even know. He convinced me to have the day off work. Which was very sweet and kind of him. But now not being at work has made me feel even more of a failure. Maybe I held a too higher expectation? 
It may also be that I’ve been having later nights than usual and I have to get up pretty early for work. But it just felt so odd to be tired, mediate and then feel excellent at work these past days and then today... nope. This might just be a whole load of crap I’m writing I just want to understand why.. anyway if you’ve read all this. I just thank you for taking the time.",0
"I was never really a big drinker. However, I did enjoy drinking casually with friends in a social setting. I enjoyed the reduced inhibition it gave me. However, after I started meditating earnestly, I began to pay attention to how alcohol really effects my body. I began to observe how alcohol changes my focus and attention as well as how it feels within my body. After observing these changes, I realized that I no longer enjoy it. I didn't like the feeling it gave me, and the only enjoyment I got out of it was an immediate, short-lived dopamine rush. After that, the negative effects took over. The sluggishness and inattentiveness really became a hindrance to my sense of being present.

Just thought I'd share these insights.",0
"Hello community, I've been meditating for a week now. Whilst meditating I keep repeating breathing in, breathing out in my head.
I've noticed after about 10 min into the meditation I sometimes mumble and say something far off my usual ""breathing in, breathing out"".

Is this usual, a sign of something or what.
I also sometimes feel pulsating and I warm up even though it's chilly.

Am I on the right track?",0

Hi! I’m celebrating my birthday soon and I want to do something for my friends.

"Any tips on meditating while you're sick with a cold or allergies? My nose isn't particularly stuffy, so I don't have much trouble with my breath, but inhaling deeply and having a rush of cool air against the back of my throat sends me into a coughing fit. Not exactly calming. I can't even imagine how one could meditate if they were suffering from a stuffed up nose. Other than foregoing meditation until feeling better, what are some ways to get around being sick and still meditate?",0
I’ve been doing really well in my meditation practice these past few weeks. I’ve experienced waves of euphoria several times and other blessings during meditation. Right now I’m experiencing something outside my meditation on a daily basis. Sometimes I’ll be at work doin my thang and all of a sudden I feel absolutely still. I don’t really know how to explain it other than that but it seems as if I am noticing everything in my surroundings moving and even I’m moving sometimes but I feel so still. As if my movements are calmer. Can someone shed some light on this?,0
"Safety first, of course :) 

My initial motivation to start experimenting with driving and meditation/mindfulness (M/M) was to become a better driver. I naturally find driving very boring. Much more boring than all my inner thoughts and concerns and whatever else would bubble around inside me. So to help myself become a more attentive driver I thought of utilizing some of the practices I learned from meditation. 

Specifically:

- *Breathing*: Find where my breath was going and trying to take fuller and calmer breaths. I find this helps on long drives on a highway to sustain attention on the road and environment.

- *Body Scan*: Again safety first - so I found that either before I start driving I can do a body scan to get into a comfortable but attentive driving posture. While driving, I only felt that long stretches on the highway allowed for a sort of parcelled out body scan to defuse tension across my body and develop a better posture.

- *Visual Attention*: I naturally have a sort of tunnel vision in my visual attention which isn’t ideal for surveying traffic situations. I’ve found that softening my gaze and allowing in more information from my peripheral vision allows me to a be a much more attentive driver. I sometimes practice this on the highway but it’s not super useful there. The skill really shines when driving through crowded urban areas cause it allows for noticing and tracking many more people and vehicles all around you at once.

- *Processing*: I’m not sure what the official name is for this in meditation as I am mostly a novice, but I’ve found that when I use all the above plus a sort of calm-abiding mind while driving (again only works on long, boring highway stretches) then I can sort of softly observe both the outer world (and respond accordingly when necessary) and my inner world (a sort of meditative practice). It’s not nearly as good as just meditating and doing nothing else but maybe it can be? I don’t know.

So that’s what I’ve figured out so far. What are your thoughts and experiences? Ever tried this? How far could you take it? Did you feel it helped you become a better driver? Could you access a meditative state while driving safely? :)",0
"I am sorry to bother you guys due to my ignorance, but I can't find answers to what I'm experiencing anywhere. I was meditating about 8 minutes ago afor at least 10 minutes. About 5 minutes in I started feeling my energy rise and somewhat violent vibrations. There was no pain, but I had the feeling that if I continue I was going to give up the ghost and leave my body. I wasn't scared, but it's safe to say that I wasn't ready for it. I opened my eyes hoping that it would subside, but it didn't stop until I started physically moving. The sensation was about the same as feeling 3 billion bolts of electricity running through my body, but without the pain. I started to just let it rock, but its almost impossible to be perfectly fine with being struck by 15 lightening bolts and feeling you spirit lift up from your body and transcending consciousness lol. This is the 2nd time I've had this happen, ever. Does ANYBODY have advice or know what went on? Should I have kept going? Am I going crazy? Perhaps. I'm going to take a shower and go back in to attempt to figure out ""where"" I was going. Help is appreciated and much love 💕

"I came to the realization today that maybe my ego has prevented me from being happy all along. I don't know, but it sure is scary to think about.  I like to think that I have it in check but it's checked me. I went to one BJJ class and didn't go back even though I wanted to. That's just one example of many of me folding when things get challenging. I can't face the fact that I may be less awesome than I make my self out to be. It's just as scary to think that I might be stronger because if that's true then it's ALL on me. Sorry if this doesn't make sense, as I am sleep deprived.",0
"I've been meditating for 15-20 minutes every morning for the past 3 weeks.  First thing in the morning after I brush my teeth and wash my face I go and meditate.  I've been doing mantra meditations mostly.  I am confident, Everything will be alright, I can do this, etc. With a little bit of just focusing on my breath mixed in.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've started I feel more in control and aware of my emotions.  I can recognize what is causing me to feel sad or happy easier and almost immediatly.  However, every emotion is more intense.  I've never felt anxiety before, but for the past week I have been a ball of nerves and I know exactly why.  I have a crush on someone and Im pretty sure she likes me back, but it would be a pretty bad idea to date atm, but thats beside the point. The point of the post is that I don't like this anxiety.  I don't know if I like feeling everything more fully even the good stuff.  I just did really well on a project and brought extra value to my team and feel super proud about it.  Idk if I have felt prouder about something before.  And even that good feeling, feels almost too intense.  Life was easier when it was duller.

"The great cosmic joke is that you are what you are seeking. 

All the religious and spiritual seeking on this planet and you end up back where you started. We all look for happiness, peace and fulfillment in the things of the world, yet all along these things are our very nature – our very own center of being. 

Every single thing you imagine yourself to be is a clever lie constructed by a psychological defense mechanism against the existential truth of transiency.  In other words you are not who you think you are.

""I laugh when I think how I once sought paradise as a realm outside of the world of birth. It is right in the world of birth and death that the miraculous truth is revealed. But this is not the laughter of someone who suddenly acquires a great fortune; neither is it the laughter of one who has won a victory. It is, rather, the laughter of one who; after having painfully searched for something for a long time, finds it one morning in the pocket of his coat.""

"Is it possible, through patient and experienced meditative practices, to explore one's own unconscious?

Forgive me if this question sounds stupid, ignorant, or uniformed ... but I'm really a neophyte in this area and striving hard to learn. I understand and appreciate meditation can evidently bring about a great deal of emotional benefits in the form of relaxation, stress reduction, so on and so forth. What I'm mostly interested in is finding some way of “discovering myself” – I want to meet the *real me*, deep down past all the layers of ego and psyche I've wrapped about my core to mask and hide who I really am. Does any of this make sense? I feel almost as though I need a vision quest of some sort, to find my true self and subsequently set myself upon a path toward positive growth and spiritual enlightenment. 

And it recently occurred to me that perhaps I ought to inquire about meditation. I realize I might perhaps require training and a great amount of experience and effort before achieving any sort of “breakthroughs” ... but is this sort of thing possible, and if so, what manner of meditative traditions or techniques would it be most wise for a person in my situation to pursue to better dive past the self-critical conscience mind and into the depths of the basic, subconscious core of my own identity?

I got pretty upset and was crying a lot tonight and wanted to meditate before bed to calm myself. I found it really difficult as I couldn’t help but get caught back up in those emotions.

I’d really like this to be a technique I can employ in those tough moments.,0
"Everybody always says “you need to change your mindset”. Which I agree is super valuable, but how?? Like what specifically did you do to worry less and be more confident?",0
"For example, how would you handle a situation where someone states an opinion or feeling of their own which differs from your own. I find that sometimes I have an emotion towards this and I struggle with understanding that feeling the intense emotion isn't bad and that just because I may feel a negative emotion doesn't mean the person's stance is inherently bad or harmful. Take the case of my significant other and I, she said she feels like she might not want kids and that she's been thinking about whereas I do later on in life, this caused an emotional reaction in me because I'm worried if we do reach that point, it's something to worry about even if her stance or thoughts about it change. 

I accept that this is her feelings about it, and I can't change it, I have been breathing more and letting myself feel the emotions and be very aware of it and why I feel that way, how do I make sure I am not unfair to her feelings or not understanding. Maybe I'm just worried about this too much? 

What's a healthy way to deal with these things? I try to be aware but at some point I have a thought where it's saying I'm disconnected from my emotions and her just because I am trying to be aware and realize I'm not my emotions. Is it normal to feel a little disconnected when you are able to separate yourself from the emotions you feel? Is this bad? I have so many questions",0

I made it about 4 or 5 days but was surprised that even when I woke up feeling ok, and the 5 minutes went well, I would still find myself crying after.  After those few days the idea of trying to meditate felt like too much of an emotional weight to take on.

Some of these meditations will help manifest the most positive ascension timelines for humanity. The above link is one very effective mass meditation that, if you take part in, will surely help move our planet closer to a timeline of world peace. Please give it a chance and try it out. You can do the meditations on this site, even if it is not the exact time of  the meditation schedule. There are also many other different mass meditations on the home page of the website I linked.

The following two links are a few free pages about how to do the merkaba meditation (recreating your human lightbody)-

This meditation, if done while feeling love energy, will release negativity and blockages from your chakras and open them up, thus restoring proper energy flow in your body, and improving your health. It can also change your consciousness to a higher dimensional awareness of peace, love and harmony with all life everywhere.


I highly suggest giving this meditation a try. Here is a guided audio link on YT of the merkaba meditation:




https://youtu.be/81Kf3UBQ1g8




Its from the book ""the ancient secrets of the flower of life part 2"".  The book also teaches spiritual anatomy of your 13 chakras,  healing, psychic powers, how to cast out entities/demons from your energy field, how to reconnect to mother earth,  the cosmos and your higher self,  and talks about a few intergalactic conspiracies and the current great awakening!


Here's a few pages from the book about the Lucifer experiment and how we can stop judgment and transcend this duality:

Here is another very useful meditation called the unity breath. It goes hand in hand with merkaba meditation. It will allow you to tap into a stream of infinite healing love energy:

"I've been practicing mindfulness meditation for 4 years. Over the last month or two I've developed two of the following physical sensations:

* A constant feeling of pressure in my head as if it were a balloon overfilled with water
* Occasionally, my head and upper back want to fold forward 90 degrees spontaneously. They hang as if I were a rag doll. It feels good to be in this position but it looks bizarre from the side.

I have hypotheticals of there being like body memory or trauma within me that wants to be expressed but I have no idea really...

Has anybody experienced things like this? Any ideas on what might be happening?",0
"* Meditate same time everyday, this will help you slip into deep meditation quicker. 
* Try to eat light before you meditate
* drink alot of water before your session.
* Keep your back straight, if you feel it slouching straighten it. 

If your shooting to extend your mediation sessions to 30mins to 1 hour, to 1 hour to 2 hours, etc - Pace yourself. Each day hold your meditation longer and longer.  


After weeks of consistent meditation(keep in mind, you have to do this at the same time)  you should be able to get into a deep meditation(samadhi) within 30-40 minutes. You will fall in and out of samadhi deepening on how long you are going for.   


Hope this helps someone",0
"I've tried many times, and I just could not ever end a session feeling like I did what I was supposed to. I felt like I never actually ""meditated"" before. It was only today that I finally understood what meditation is about. Usually when meditating, one of the basic concepts is to ""focus on the breath"". **focus** being the key word here. So Everytime I meditated, I tried my hardest to ""focus on the breath"", and come back to it if my mind wandered off. I found out this was my problem. 

I use the Headspace app, and almost every meditation session, Andy (The narrator), starts off with focusing on the breath. After a little while, he tells you to ""let your mind wander"" for just a couple seconds. Well something I noticed several times (That I guess never clicked in my head), was that I realized that the more I focused on my breath, the harder it was to do. It was like by focusing on the breath, I was RESISTING thoughts. Whenever he would say ""let your mind wander"", that's when I felt most calm and like I didn't have to give any effort. When I focused on the breath, thoughts kept flying in everywhere, and it was near impossible to focus on the breath. When it was ""let your mind wander time"", I realized those thoughts that kept trying to come in, weren't anymore (At least no where near to the same degree as when I focused on my breath). And therefore there was no more resistance. 

Just today is when this realization clicked in, during my Headspace session. After it was over, I realized that I need to just let my mind wander the ENTIRE TIME. I'm not going to ""focus"" on ANYTHING. And I realized by doing this, I felt a sense of freedom, and zero resistance, and I wasn't ""attaching"" to my thoughts that were coming in anymore. All this time and I never got it. Now I do. Excited to have more sessions and see the benefits now!",0
"When somebody reads enough about meditation and other peoples subjective experiences, one is bound to stumble upon many people describing lights, absolute bliss, one-ness, spiritual hallucinations and other things, that everybody is told not to chase.

But I desire such an experience. I am not sure if I'd believe in whatever I experience, but it would be a lie, if I didn't want to **feel** one-ness, all encompassing blissfull light, spiritual or religious stuff and so on. At least once.

After reading like 20 of such experiences, I ""see"" them everywhere. Whenever I have a good meditation session (just watching the breath and going back to it over and over again) where my chattering minds shuts up for a while and I 'kinda' see white points, my mind goes into a hyperactive ""Oh boi, here it comes, here it comes, don't get distracted, watch the breath, ah, it's over, just back to the breath.... Ah! It comes back! Nvm... just back to the breath....""-mode.

Which means I'd likely never experience something like that. Can't really change that, but the bigger problem is that my mind starts something like this whenever I am having a good session... it feels like a hindrance that degrades a good time... But I can't let the expectation/hope for such an experience go.... after all, it would be incredible interesting to experience something like that...

"i’ve been practicing mindfulness meditation for about 3 months and have been practicing consistently every day for about 3 weeks now. i’ve noticed that i’m able to get deeper into very relaxed states quicker as i practice more. today i reached a state in which my body was totally and completely relaxed. in this moment i truly felt like i was observing my thoughts from a third person point of view. my brain was jumping from one thought to the next with no breaks in between. it was like listening to my inner voice just chatter away to itself. at some point i felt my mind cease to think- and my body literally felt like it was floating. for just a couple of seconds i felt pure bliss. then i heard the sound of my dog’s collar jingle as she entered the room and a thought entered my mind again. i tried to picture the thought as a cloud in the sky and let it leave my mind but then immediately after that another thought followed it. and another. and i noticed the pattern. i had the epiphany that - holy shit, my mind is actually thinking like this for hours upon hours every single day- this is its normal state. it’s insane. our minds are constantly making up things and repeating them. i tried to get myself back into that state where my mind was free of thought but every time i tried different thoughts would pop up. it was like my inner voice wouldn’t be quiet! lol. this was also the first time that i experienced myself wanting to stay in meditation longer than usual. normally i set my timer but today i did not and instead of coming out of my meditation i decided to stay for several more minutes in this relaxed state. ironically whenever i awoke from my meditative state the song playing on my phone was titled “feelings come and go like clouds.” i’m curious who else has experienced something similar to this. i’m really excited about what i experienced and i’m eager to keep practicing. hopefully i can get myself back to this “thoughtless” state and enjoy more of it. it was truly wonderful. namaste :)",0

"I've recently started reading Dune from Frank Herbert, and the lessons from the book so far draw so many parallels to my lessons in meditating. As of yesterday's session, I've been going through my breathing patterns and noting emotions and thoughts. I also see that focusing on breathing, rather than on restlessness and sleepiness, help my mind. But, the strongest comparison comes from the quote, ""Fear is the mind-killer."" From this one quote and trying to get closer to clarity of mind, I can finally see myself smiling in the mirror and noticing the little things in life. There is additional quotes from that line that talk about facing fears, and overcoming it, which I thought to be Camus-esque. But, it also is a lesson from my meditating. Whenever I find my mind working 500 thoughts a minutes, I take time to think of my thoughts as cars passing by. There is no tension.

"Hello peeps!

I'm a curious person who likes to learn about different techniques and different philosophies so I decided to sign up for a TM talk/presentation.

This is my experience of the TM presentation at their office in my City. 

A lady sitting behind a laptop, under a projector screen presentened TM to myself and 2 other people. 
They show you a tonne of slides of the health benefits of it. Scientific evidence -  including EEG scans and lots of other brian wave stuff. Lots of graphs showing the benefits which I found to be extremely vague. I pointed out that they didnt say anything about what the sample size was, what questions were asked. They didnt mention how long the participants had practiced or any details. The slides just showed an increase in this or a decrease in that.

After all their slides about different parts of the brain I asked if they had any studies about TM and the default mode network. They said that this area is very active and lights up during TM.


There was also a slide section comparing different meditation practices -  it really felt like they were slagging on all the other types. 
They suggested that mindfulness meditation acted on certain parts of the brain (the ones they mentioned earlier that were associated with sleepiness I believe) and they differentiated Vipassana meditation as the ""direct focus"" kind and that it worked on a different part as well. They mentioned compassion meditation as well but none of these other types changed the brain as much as TM does. TM was different b/c it gave your brain something to do and also gave you the ""transendental exp"". 


After just over an hour long talk they slap you with the price tag. 
$1310 CAD which includes 2 1on1 lessons. They also mentioned you can come back anytime to ""tune up"" your TM. 

I know I sound cynical...well that's because thats how I feel. I know very little about meditation so it's very possible I missed something or am confused. 

Hope all who read this are having a rad day!",0
"Hi I’m a male and I’m 24 years old and I live in Italy. I’m just 5’4” in the morning and this is literally killing me. I have anxiety since 2 months now, I saw a therapist and I’m taking pills for depressions and social anxiety and ODC but the obsession of my height is present I’m my mind every second. I don’t know how I can get out of this situation, because I really cannot live anymore with this depression, anxiety and obsession. Help me please",0
"Hey Everyone, I'm new to reddit but I figured I would give this a shot. 

Context: I moved for work about a year ago and ever since then I have been over analyzing everything and comparing myself to others. On top of that I started seeing this girl a while back, we ramped things up really quickly and I fell for her really hard even though I knew she was moving before we started seeing each other. I know realized it would not have worked out in the long run. Ever since then she has been on my mind.

Everything else in the grand scheme of things is going really well. I have hobbies, been doing new things, been going on trips, meeting up with friends, etc. When I'm keeping myself busy I'm ok, but once I'm on my own I start to ruminate and overthink. I have been meditating 8-10 minutes in the morning and in the evening, and 5 minutes when I get back from work. I meditate by sitting on the floor by the window (so I can hear the bugs and birds chirping) and focus on my breath.

I know things take time but and all good things come from consistent effort. But I was hoping that you guys might have some pointers/tips on how to maybe better my meditation and be more mindful throughout the day.",0
"I made a post earlier with a question about my unique situation regarding guiding meditation but I felt that making a new post that is phrased differently would start more conversation being more helpful to me and more entertaining and thought provoking for everyone else.

so...

Do you guys think that anyone can guide meditation and organize a meditation group? 

Should the guide be experienced in meditative practices or can they be relatively new? 

Should they have a rigorous personal practice or can they not meditate at all? 

Will a meditation group be productive if it lacks a diverse array of people along different places in the spiritual path? Common thought has me believe that meditation groups need a teacher who has been far down the spiritual path...

What do you guys think about this subject?",0

"People talk that they go to their breathing to focus but i like to focus on my awareness. Sort of focusing on the “seeing” that my brain is doing. I don’t meditate often. Does it matter if I point my focus onto my breath or the body or somewhere else? Are different things achieved in the mediation this way?

Also. Weird thing. As soon as i begin focus when I start meditating, i get presented with the thought“welcome” like introducing myself to my awareness or vis versa . Every time as soon as I start meditating “welcome” never fails. Is this weird? Lol",0
"For me it’s the fact that a good meditation session feels like I’ve been transported to another dimension and an alternate reality.

"Hi r/meditation. I've been meditating for about a week and I've recently been finding it hard to focus / I'm getting frustrated because my breaths are so shallow. When I slouch my breathing seems to work better than when I sit up straight. It seems the straighter my back, the tighter my diaphragm. It makes it hard to focus or be at peace when I feel it hard to breathe as I am not getting much air this way. Does anyone have any tips to help with this? It would be much appreciated as meditation really helps me with stress but this tension is making it hard to relax while meditating",0

Let's get some Headspace together. Just a few minutes a day can reduce your stress and help you sleep better.,0
I’ve been doing a meditation course on the app Headspace and I used to be able to enter a fully relaxed state concentrating only on the breath. It was amazing. But lately I’ve not been sleeping 8h/night and I feel like I can’t focus properly because my mind starts wandering like if I was dreaming. Is it because of lack of sleep? I’ve read that when you don’t get enough deep sleep your brain’s dream necessity starts flooding into your daily activities.,0
"I just completed my first 20 hours of total meditation time with a 20 minute session and it was such an incredible experience I wanted to share. 

I started meditating before sunrise so the time would end just as the sun was hitting my window. During the last half of my time, warm tingling energy started radiating from my heart outward filling my body with my breaths. It filled me with so much peace. Like a new layer of my mind opened that I could just melt into. 

I then transitioned into wishing love, health, and peace for my son and partner and the tingling got stronger and stronger. 

Has anyone else experienced this? 

I’ve never had an experience like this before. 
I’m just having a beautiful morning sitting here in the soft glow of the sunrise and thought I’d share ✨😊🙏",0
"Often at work, but sometimes at home too, when I know I have a lot of things to get done, I really struggle to stay mindful. There is a lot of inner conflict and tension within my body which urges me to rush and get through things as quickly as I can. This increases when I know I don't have enough time to get the things I need to do finished.

When I return to the present it feels very unpleasant and my mind is quickly pulled back into creating stories about why I have so much work to do, who's fault it is, fantasies about what I could do next etc.

What's the best approach here? Just keep coming back to what I am doing over and over? Try to slow down and move more smoothly? 

Just looking for any advice or discussion about your own experiences here.",0
"I’ve been meditating for about 18days now (25 sessions- 249 minutes).  My typical practice is roughly 10-15 minutes daily in the morning. I have meditated later in the evening on some nights, and the most I have meditated in one day has been 46 minutes. I sit on a zafu in a zazen position. I’m currently using the sattva app to guide my meditations. I want to experience finding my third eye. I guess my question is how should I focus my gaze to open this shakra. I feel that if I’m looking towards the spot on my forehead that I’m almost feeling like my eyes are going cross eyed.  Am I trying to hard? Should this not be my focus? I do focus on the breath, and often times have pressures between my eyes during/after meditation.  It’s something that I’m honestly “eager” to experience.  Does anyone have any tips, or feedback for me.

"I understand that a variation of this question has been asked many times, however I am hoping to be more nuanced in what I am experiencing when I ask this question: Is it possible to get worse at meditation as you go on?

Some background: I started meditating about 3-4 years ago nearly every day. I started out with zazen and have tried other styles including TMI, Shambhala, and some self-inquiry stuff. However while I remember experiencing very brief cessation of thoughts and emotions (and it was a crazy positive experience), I distinctly remember feeling the waves of my emotions and being able to categorize them as they came and went. I could clearly feel different emotions and reactions my body experienced. Compared to now where I feel that I am struggling to even identify any feeling I am having and when asked a question such as ""bring your awareness to your heart and listen to what it's feeling"" I cannot feel anything. Prior to this (maybe two years ago) I was able to do this quite easily and could immediately sense my experience. 

I am extremely frustrated with my practice, but not to the point where I feel terrible about this. After all, at this point this practice is simply a part of my life at this point. Positive or negative feelings aside, I feel that overall it has benefited me. The concern for me is whether this is simply a ""stage"" in the journey or if I am actually doing something wrong and training my brain in an incorrect way. I appreciate any insight people can give me. Thank you all so much.",0
"Has anybody meditated for a long time if so, by being in the present moment always did it affect your health negatively?",0
"In 2 months, I have an entrance exam which I decided to give my all in. The exam is for 3 hours with no breaks in between. It consists of 100 questions. Basically, there's no time to breathe. My case here is, I am able to do well for the first hour of the exam before my stamina and focus start to fade away and I can see that in the results. The exam is broken up into 3 sections. I get 99 percentile in the first section and then start decreasing to 90 and 80 in the later sections. It's not that I can't answer the questions. When I analyze the test I've written, there were questions I was able to answer that I left, or I made a silly mistake in the ones that I answered. I've been through a multiple of these tests now, and this has always been the case. Through constant feedback, I think I now know what's the real problem here. It's not the skill but the focus to persist. 

Also, 2 more things to add: 

1. During the exams, through section 1-3, I know my focus is not 100%. I've been thinking about other things that randomly pop up in my mind which I think I'm unable to control. My ex cheating on me a year ago still haunts to this date, adding to the mental strain and distraction. 

2. I know there are apps for meditation that can be helpful, I've tried. It works for a day or two, and then I forget about it and I get back to the same old self. 

I need a 99.xx percentile overall to clear the exam. With 2 months left, a bit of advice on helping me focus would be of real help and it's much appreciated.",0

"Two years ago I had a very bad emotional breakdown.  I had acquired PTSD from a relationship with a woman who dumped me.  I needed therapy, I'm still in therapy - but the most wonderful gift my therapist gave me was the suggestion to meditate.  He didn't tell me how to do it, he just suggested I learn on my own - as it will be part of the healing process.  So I did.  I looked into Buddhism, Hindu traditions and breathing techniques, mindfulness.  It was a struggle at first.  My ego was still eating away at me:  ""Why me? Why doesn't she love you anymore?  I love her so much, I need her! What am I going to do?"" Two years later, I look back at it all very differently.  Sometimes we just need a catalyst in our lives to spark something beautiful, to push us in a new direction.  Meditation helps with so many issues.  When we clear our minds of thoughts, clarity ensues.  The real truth comes out.  I never understood the term ""love yourself"" - and now I completely understand it.  Love and light to you all.  Meditation works, never give up.",0

I've decided that I want to give meditation a go, however I'm not quite sure how to start. I don't want to set an unrealistic goal, instead start small and build up.

"for a long time i felt like i wasn’t “progressing” very much in my practice. i felt like whenever i would sit down to meditate i would find myself intellectualising about everything i experienced. i became frustrated that i couldn’t stop doing that. but today it was as if i just accepted that that was a part of me—that i will find myself intellectualising about my experiences. which lead me to a second insight.

i often use the Waking Up meditation app, outside of my normal practice. and Sam Harris often says “pay attention to the breath from the moment it starts to the moment it is ends.” or “pay attention to the moment a thought arises” that sort of thing. and i was again sort of frustrated for the longest time that it seemed my conscious awareness of something only occurred a few moments after it had started. i would find myself thinking about something without even knowing how the thought began. i think i realised more that i’m just watching things happen. there’s only an illusion of control that somehow occurs, but when i pay attention i can’t find any. even so far as the accepting of these parts of myself seem out of my control. i couldn’t force myself to accept them, but through lots of practice it just spontaneously came about one day. 

it’s all very confusing.",0

"I learned in my one class that nirvana is essentially “feeling/watching” both positive and negative emotions go by without attachment and that it is pure bliss. To me tho, that kind of seems scary, doesn’t it? Learning this made me question meditation a little bit. Is the goal of meditation to be able to deattatch from negative thoughts to be able to focus on positive thoughts? Cuz to me, that would be nirvana. When you deattatch from positive AND negative thoughts, that seems borderline depressing and that seems like one would just be emotionless in a bad way. I also don’t understand how you can go without attachment from both without repressing emotions. Say if you have reached a very high meditative state in your life and someone close to you dies. How would one who has achieved such a state react in that situation??? Because the way I see one reacting to that is emotionless and that seems terrifying.

"So I have picked up meditation recently and I have found myself more clued in and in better moods. I feel much more calm and clear.

I am curious though. I have a long history with a dysfunctional family. I have had to cut off close family and friends (even cut off my brother) because I feel like they don't respect boundaries. I would say a significant chunk of my negative life events have come as a result of being a ""nice guy"". As a result I almost feel sort of guilty for being cheery or upbeat. Sometimes I catch myself with a slight smile throughout the day.

I am almost scared that if I am seen in this light or I see myself in this light I won't be able to standup for myself.

**does meditating make you passive? less able to standup for yourself?**

My intuition is that the answer is no. Unless you hold ridiculous new agey spiritual beliefs that holding anger against someone is wrong. Which I don't at all. I think meditation could make one submissive if the individual uses it as a form of escapism or the individual firmly believes that harming others under any circumstance is wrong (which is just silly)",0

Instead of being defeated by this, I simply stop thinking as soon as I remember my objective, and try again. I don't expect to be able to maintain 20 straight minutes of a clear mind immediately or soon. But I'm giving this thing a year to see how it goes. A year without skepticism, just observation. And one thing I have noticed it does seem like the practice I get putting the brakes on overthinking while meditating has made me less apt to overthink during the rest of my day. I also noticed I now can sense when I am tense, and make an active effort to relax and release tension. In retrospect I couldn't even tell the difference between being tense and relaxed.

"Yo, I recently got back from my first 10 day vipassana retreat. I had done 3 Zen retreats before, but omg this was so much better!

I can’t believe nobody ever told me how different Vipassana meditation is than other meditation techniques! I was mind blown when they taught it to us on the fourth day. It’s not so easy to describe, and you probably can’t learn it without doing the 10 day course, because they teach techniques step by step that build on each other. 

**So what is this great unique technique?** Awareness of sensations in the body. It’s not just “body scanning”. You put your awareness on a body part and stay there till you feel sensations. They feel like buzzing vibrations, almost like little pieces of sand flowing around. A myriad of other body sensations can arise as well, but mostly you isolate your awareness on each part of the body feeling these sensations, and then you sweep them throughout your body. 

The point isn’t to feel sensations, it’s to remain equanimous despite whatever pleasant or unpleasant sensations you feel. Supposedly these sensations have something to do with the unconscious mind, and thus you’re reprogramming yourself to not react in craving or aversion.

Their retreats are free! They aren’t a religion (although, it’s definitely the teachings of the Buddha).   No bland meals like in my old Zen retreats, you get a tasty vegetarian buffet. Go find a Vipassana center near you and learn this amazing unique meditation technique!!!!!!",0

“Do you worship me?” I told her yes and then she ate me... it wasn’t painful of like how you normally eat food it was like she was pushing me inside of her and merging my everything with hers.

"I'm relatively new to practicing my mind and I noticed something interesting while narrating myself- like interior dialogue. I noticed that while I was questioning and answering within myself, I heard a second self blurt an answer simultaneous to my own self. This was both surprising and not surprising. 

I've been wittingly practicing my mind for quite a while, but I've only recently been able to recognize/appreciate minds' eyesight and I think I overdid it. I was caught in what felt like ""rumination"", but it wasn't any single looping thought, it was just that I couldn't close my eyes with seeing ""everything"".

I've recognized this ""second self"" far in the past, but never had I recognized it within my mind, as it had only expressed itself external (like me just saying something to myself, out loud, that I did not wittingly say.). I was surprised because it was the first time I heard a voice in my head that I can say without doubt, that ""I"" had no influence over what the second self said. When it spoke, it ""felt"" strikingly different, yet a part of, what it felt to be where ""I"" am- meaning, what I attribute to the ""thinker"". 

Later that night, my head was swirling with imagery and I began to feel like I had simply allowed negative entities passage. I felt like I experienced the tip of what could be madness. My head was pulsing until I was able to relax it. I didn't sleep until dawn and only for a few hours. It was a good lesson learned.",0

Has anyone else experienced this before? It was completely different to when you get all types of sensations. There was just nothing with no observer either.",0
"i was following along with a guided meditation last night before bed, and it was going well up til the point that the recording said to ""finally relax all the way to zero"". well at first my mind was blank and i felt calm, but soon after i was bombarded with a bunch of anxious thoughts, and i felt very nervous. it's like i suddenly became aware of everything going wrong around me. i kept trying to bring my attention back to my breathing, but to no avail. this usually doesn't happen to me, and it was very distressing.

so is this a sign that there's underlying anxiety i need to work through? like built-up stress? or is it not a big deal and i should just try again tonight?",0
"Let me start by saying that I do not by any means have any infinite answer nor have I found the depth of what mediation can be. After reading many stories on this thread, I believe that at this point I desire to express the impact it has had and what it has brought me in just under one years time, in effort to help others. 

First, I meditate two times a day, morning and night, 20 minutes each time. I meditate with some time of ambient noise (fan on low setting) along with a very downtempo mix from soundcloud (check out slumber sessions). I sit, I have a two syllable mantra, and breathing is and has always been my main focus. 

Much like many others in this group, I could go on and on about the impact that it has made, but in effort to keep this short(er) and concise, I would say that meditation is what I would compare to a LONG IV drip for the mind. You may never feel it right away but the impact comes over time. 

There will be bad days.

There will be days where you sit and have so much thought that your mantra is drown out, breathing seems impossible,  and that any time sitting feels like an eternity. 

There will be days where you just don't have any desire to sit. 

There will be hours spent feeling like this may, in fact be a waste of time.  

Keep going. 

Continue on through the days where you don't want to participate and even if you don't feel it, stick it out. 

Because there will be that one day. That one time you open your eyes and the world feels a little bit different. 

That day where you will be swept with so much emotion that sobbing mid-mediation is the only option. 

That day where you're sitting in a situation and you feel the ability to be present, to not control the flow, but to exist in the moments between. To recognize awareness, knowing that the next thought is temporary and will not take away from this moment. 

The point is don't suppress what comes; instead let it come and simply let it go. 

When you take away the desire for the result, you begin to open up the awareness that allows you to become one with it. 

You will never find ""it"" but you will know when it has found you. 

In conclusion, try to minimize expectation. Commit to it if you feel like it has a place and serves a purpose.  And nurture each moment you can recognize. Whether a feeling of good, or bad. Address it. Let it have its moment and when you do, you will find room for so much to enter when you stop letting past of future events cloud up the present. 

Personally, I know that I'm only getting started and I know that I am going forward in the direction I am, because of meditation. I also know that IF I CAN DO IT, ANYONE CAN. 

It isn't easy, and it takes a bit of determination. But keep it simple, if it finds a place in your life, embrace it, explore. Above all, be yourself and live at your own pace.",0

"When I meditate, especially after not being so consistent with it, the first sensations I get are anxiety and stress.

"Why do you live so hard? For what, for whom?

You have give up on your dream life and are busy living in a compromise with reality.
In your own reality, you see your dream as a vain delusion.
You think that everyone lives like that.
You think that you live the right answer.
However, you always feel restless and cramped in the depths of your inner world.
Your mind says something is wrong.

What were the teachings that the spiritual teachers in all times and places wanted to convey to us?
Although today we are now able to recognize their teachings easily and accustomed, we are immersed in the profound and form of the words of the old way of teaching, passing by without knowing what we need to know.

In the movie ""The Matrix"", the main character Neo is offered the choice between a red pill and a blue pill by Morpheus.
The blue pill will allow him to go back to his life without transformation, be satisfied with the existing reality and believing in what he has believed so far.
On the other hand, the red pill will allow him to he has a chance to realize the truth of the essence, become a true master of his world and become truly free.

Like Neo, you are standing at the crossroads of your life at this moment.
Maybe you have a vague fear or disdain about choosing to realize the truth of the essence.
But if you want to escape from the existing reality, if you want to fill your life with true satisfaction and happiness, you can choose to realize the truth of the essence.

When you realize the essence, you understand that the truth you've been looking for is yourself.
And you understand that you have the power to be free from all the pain, that all the possibilities are on your side.
And now, in this moment, you have a complete experience of being truly free.

The choice of this moment now is the most important first choice given to you.
The choice of this moment now makes a huge difference in your life.
If you postpone the choice to the next time, the choice disappears without returning.
Maybe this is the last chance given to you, hope that miracle with the chance not to scatter will follow you.",0
"I'm often terrible at sticking with things, so I'm pleased to say that I'm nearly two weeks into daily morning meditation and it's going great.

Although I have meditated about 60ish times (according to my mindfulness app) over the last year, I'd still consider myself a novice. I've been using the Calm app, which has great weekly and 21 day programmes. 

Meditation is a great way to combat waking up in the morning with the usual haze of stress and anxiety; I feel at peace afterwards (albeit for a short time) and the techniques I've learned have helped me approach typical daily problems a different way.

Anyway, that's my story. Wish you the best with your own journey.",0
"I have very low willpower to resist cookies, desserts and breads so I have failed a lot with my attempts to eat clean.

If you want to know more about this, you're welcome to watch this short video I made: https://youtu.be/S1N9d5h3bGQ

" Hey [/r/meditation](https://www.reddit.com/r/meditation)!

We all know that meditation is not an antidote or a quick fix to be used in the moment of bad experience. It's a regular practice that slowly helps us handle these moments when they arise.

However, I wanted to kick off the discussion by asking;

In a moment of intense emotion (e.g. overwhelm, anxiety, anger), do you have a standard procedure of getting through it. As in, ""When I get anxious, I first do this, then this, then this....""

I personally have a method I go through and would love to put it into a post/graphic (and possibly even an interactive feature in Guide) but would love to read what you all do. I'll edit this comment with my method once the discussion gets going.

Thanks and I look forward to the great discussion!

"After reading about Kirtan Kriya meditation and how it helps slow, and maybe prevent, Alzheimer's, I've been practicing it most weekdays for the past couple of months. The thing is, the past couple of times, I've dozed off mid chant, even while still doing the finger movements.

"I just wanted to share! I’m absolutely flabbergasted. I did not think something like this was possible. My lower back has been screaming for the past few days due to an irritated psoas(I think). It has really been bothering me and getting in the way of me being able to focus on work. I just did a ten minute guided meditation. And afterward I noticed a massive decrease in lower back pain. 

I want to make it clear that I was not meditating to help with the pain. The pain had nothing to do with why I meditated. It was just a regular old daily meditation. 

I hear time and time again that some pain can be due to us “holding onto something” or stress, or whatever, and I’ve never really bought it 100%. 

Perhaps through this experience, my mind might be changing. 

I just wanted to share this for anyone who is dealing with pain. I know it can be a hopeless and intrusive experience to be dealing with that. I’m not saying it can cure all pain, but maybe there is some hope for some relief.

One final thing to note. This meditation was an uncharacteristically “fruitful” meditation, I fell right into a nice state, was not too distracted, was able to clear the mind somewhat better than usual. Maybe that has something to do with it. Who knows!

Namaste! Peace and love",0
"I have been practicing meditation for a few months now. A few days ago I got this profound clarity in my mind. My mind was still chattering, but I could observe the thoughts effortlessly. I could catch the thoughts at the beginning itself. I was confident to let go of  my thoughts. My mind wouldn't wander even if tried to make it wander. And I felt like all our worries were absurd. 

I was like this the whole day. But the clarity was gone the next day. I just wasn't confident enough to let go. What was this experience. How can I make it permanent. Can someone explain?",0

" We think meditation or any such practice will give us relief from the uneasiness of what we do not like or find irritating, confusing. It is only when you see that this uneasiness can not be thrown away from the mind that whole energy is concentrated here. 

Body and brain require food and sleep to recharge. This is sufficient, complete in itself. You are essentially at peace, at rest unless you are in immediate physical danger. Unless you recognize this fact-any practice, device as meditation and so on to bring peace and control is to seek relief by running away from what you do not like. Energy remains dissipated.  
 Q. - I have done meditation, read spiritual books, read your posts-but the discomfort does not go? It surfaces in one form or the other.

One essentially feels discomfort when one faces ‘what one does not like’. The discomfort can not be undone or removed or thrown away from the mind. If discomfort goes, life goes. Once you come to this, can you bear the discomfort and see the emergence of action. The whole energy is here.

Now one understands, sees the whole process-the discomfort stops troubling you. What you want or want to do in any situation becomes clear. You are in the limitless field where nothing stops, nothing stabilizes.",0
"I’m very very new to meditation. I’ve only done a couple serious sessions, ~5 minutes each. Usually what I’ve done is I’ll close my eyes, focus on my breathing, and try to imagine myself in a sort of space. Like surrounded by stars. Then I try to imagine the actual place I’m in at the moment, and then changing my surroundings into space and stars until I feel like I’m floating a little.

Does this have anything good to it? There probably isn’t an answer to this, but am I meditating right? Is there anything real to what I think I’m doing?

Also, what recommendations would you make for me?",0
"Been meditating two years, but inconsistently (2-3x week instead of daily). Now I'm trying to become consistent and have been for a week or two.

I realize how much happier when I'm able to catch my unawareness, and getting sucked into bad thoughts especially when I'm stressed or negative. I even understand the concept of thoughts and how we don't have to follow them.

But I can't seem to recognize the times I'm unaware, which is the idea of general mindfulness. I still get caught up and even if I recognize it (like saying ""oh that storyline again""), I can't seem to stop the inertia of the thoughts sometimes (ie recognizing I'm lost, but still going along with my thoughts).

Is there a type of meditation that will help with this muscle more or will it just take more time with consistent meditation)?

And any other practical method from people who have mastered not getting lost in thought off the pillow?",0

"For those of you that have had a major realization that began the true process of tearing your world, both physically and mentally, apart, how are you coping with reality now? I’m talking the real deal, a nuclear explosion that annihilates everything, that there is no going back from, not just emotional releases or big life changes that cause deep emotional reactions. Mine began when I saw Maya, the illusory world, with my physical eyes for the first time. Think Matrix. That was some scary shit and now its all I see. My eyes have never been the same. 

After settling in to my new paradigm small layers of the self began to crumble away because now that I had experienced that the outside world wasn’t real there was no place for the ego to hold on to. Some pieces left with an alleviating sense of release and others with the pain of being doused with acid or skinned alive. The big ones lasted for days or weeks sometimes and brought a loss that is very hard to explain other than calling it a personal death full of grief and sorrow. And they are still coming. 

Only now the layers are going deeper and it seems like my mind is melting away now too, just like the perceived physical world. My brain no longer functions the same as it’s became hard to think. I can only actually observe the process now that it has began and though I feel I made it happen with my strong meditative work I’ve lost any sense of control and it’s all falling away on its own now. I’m truly just the spectator of what seems to be total madness. 

The hardest part is dealing with what feels like a loss of sanity and general functions of the mind. Has anyone out there ever experienced anything similar? If so, whats your life like now? How are you coping with this total loss of the perceived idea of mind, reality, and self? I’m well aware that there is no self, but it’s hard to exist here as the observer while watching it be ripped apart and your mind melt away into goo. 

The free fall just goes deeper and deeper into nothing.",0
"I wanted to share with you guys what has been my experience with my meditation practice so far:

For the past 17 years, I have been meditating on and off (ego-flex) and recently have accidentally stumbled upon the vipassana type mediation.  It seems like everyday, with each meditation, I discover yet another emotional pattern that I was completely unaware/ ignorant of.  I am constantly astounded to find these flaws in my unconscious emotional programming that I wasn't and simply couldn't have been aware/ conscious of before.  This is the part of meditation that, to me, has been the biggest paradox.  You can't be aware of the unconscious thoughts you are having today that may be brought into conscious awareness during tomorrow's meditations.  This is why taking the time to sit quietly and listen/ look/ perceive/ feel inwardly-generated stimuli has been so meaningful to me in all areas of my life;  You cannot fix what you are not aware of, and each ""epiphany"" presents a new possibility to change/ modify your habits in the direction of happiness.  I'm starting to really enjoy this whole phenomenon of discovering sensations and emotional thought patterns I was completely unaware of.  I'm sure tomorrow I will discover new patterns that are currently going on within my mind today as i write this and will then take joy in the humbling process of being continually confronted with my own ignorance.  Sometimes it hurts my ego to be confronted with my own flaws, but I'd much rather find out about these flaws via meditation and force myself to change than to be stagnant and refuse to grow.",0

On average though I feel like I become present for maybe one or two deep breaths before I'm off on some tangent. Sometimes I can relax by thinking about equanimity and at least keep my thoughts of aspects of my external life but this is far from focusing on simply breathing and sitting behind your thoughts rather than in them. It plays on my mind during meditation that I am so bad at it as well.

"Hello everyone. I'm 21 years old and have suffered from crippling anxiety most of my life. I have been diagnosed with GAD and get debilitating panic attacks almost daily. For the past few months, I have been getting immersed in the practice of mindfulness and meditation.

While I  do have become more confident and am living my life as best as I can, I notice that I am constantly on the edge of falling back into depression. Lately I have been having more trouble than ever to focus and also my body is suffering immensely from the constant state of anxiety I appear to find myself in subconsciously (tense muscles, nausea, headaches, dizziness).

"Once a driving instructor asked me if I wore sunglasses while driving during the daytime. I answered ""Not always."" He told me that not wearing sunglasses during the day will cause impaired night vision. The worst part is that, while driving at night, you don't know what you are missing!  
  
I see this as an analogy of meditation. Those people who don't meditate, who live in the past and future instead of the present moment, don't realize what they are missing, which awareness, self-awareness, uncovers. They cannot be aware, or become aware, of those buried memories that must be dealt with for them to achieve happiness and peace*!* – Paine 🎯",0
"As a teacher, I have been fortunate to receive ""premium"" or ""pro"" levels of Headspace and Calm. 

So, this is very nice if I want to lead the class in meditation or relaxation, but sometimes I want to create a station in my room using chromebooks. I'd love to have the kids grab headphones, go to a spot in my room for 10-20 minutes, and have access to the headspace pack or activity of the day.

Is this possible? Or is it only me that can access the site since I am the one logged in?

"Today was my first experience of a long, formal sitting meditation. I went on a half day retreat at a zen centre. We had two 50 minute sitting sessions in addition to walking meditation. I am used to 5-10 minute sittings so this was quite an experience for me. Unfortunately, my mind wandered throughout each sitting. I tried to focus on counting my breath to no avail. Towards the end of the sittings, my back ached so much in addition to my legs in the half lotus position. I had to uncross my legs and sit up
straight with my feet dangling off the chair. 

I think one gain for me was the elimination of disturbing intrusive thoughts like things at work that really bother me. My mind still wandered today while sitting but it was more of a happy wandering (like being at the beach).

I’m not sure how to further eliminate wandering thoughts at this point except to recognize a thought train when I see it and not get on board for a ride. Also maybe try listening more to guided meditations.

Any further suggestions on reducing wandering thoughts and dealing with pain in the body while sitting? Thanks.",0

"I know that most of people have meditated for insane amounts of days in a row, but it's my highest streak so far (credits for waking up app, don't know if I would make it that far). So far I've noticed: 

1. Better awareness and less autopilot mode in life 
2. Better control if it comes to emotion (I mean it's not like I was impulsive before, but I'm more aware of this feeling I get and I get more control of it)
3. Experiencing stuff fully, that one is really hard to describe 

It's like nothing changed, but at the same moment everything changed. So glad I found this, will keep it going.

"Hello, 

first time poster here

So I've been meditating on and off for a couple months now and tonight (30 mins ago) I felt an urge to feel good and feel like a child would feel (light, fresh, stress free, happy, content) so I sat on my bed in a Burmese position. Listen to some Tibetan bowls with my earphones so I could block outside noises (noisy family haha).   
Tried focusing on my breathing. A short while after i began to feel a light pressure between my eyebrows (third eye?) but I just let it be. Then, a weird body sensation took my focus away from my breathing and third eye to old memories.  


When i was little and had high fevers like +39°C (+102.2°F), before falling asleep, I would get this very discomforting and weird sensation in my body. I would feel my body inflated and shrunk at the same time. I have absolutely no words to describe such sensation, not even similar sensations to compare it to but I'm trying the best I can, so bear with me.   
I would feel like my soul was sinking inside of my body, more like my consciousness. My limbs would feel very large but at the same time I would feel myself very tiny inside of them. I would also get this weird taste and texture in my mouth. The only thing i could compare it to would be like synesthesia even tho I'm not sure what it feels like (I think I could feel a texture with my palate and smell)   
I could snap out of it at will but after a while I could feel it creep in again so falling asleep was very hard and discomfortable.  


So while meditating, I got the same sensation but not as intensely or at least, it wasn't uncomfortable. My body felt very big, specially my head, but not heavier!   
I would love to know if anybody has had a similar experience and if it's common 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : was meditating and had the same body sensation like when I had fever when I was a child",0

"Let me just say that I’m fairly new to meditation, about a year on and off and only really do it when I need to. I see a lot of posts on here that all talk about “awakening the third eye” or seeing this place called Maya and so on. Honestly, I don’t want to get there. Don’t get me wrong I love meditation as it’s helped me tremendously with coping with anxiety and stress by just taking a step back for a couple minutes but Im just not really into the spiritual aspect of it too much and would rather not go down that path if possible.

Is there specific meditations I should avoid for this?
If I meditate for a long enough time is this “awakening” something that I will have to deal with regardless? 
What is “awakening” and maya?",0

"So I have tried to get into meditation for some time now, and unsuccessfully.  I finally decided to give mindfulness a go(again) and after going a week straight felt something with it that I felt the first tangible benefit.

I've been a little stressed today, and didnt sleep well last night.  I sat down to meditate, closed my eyes and have any of you ever had that wound up feeling that you felt like you were ""swaying"" side to side but in reality you really arent moving? I had this at the start, but kept at it. Slowly that sensation subsided and left me just with an overwhelming calm I haven't felt before. 20 minutes later now sitting here typing this I really do feel great.

I know this may not be a new thing from most of you seasoned folks, but I have always been a person needing proof. Well I really feel like I got my proof today and I am definitely onboard to keep this up and see what other benefits I can find!",0
"Hi all. I've been meditating for a couple of months now, but not every day. I believe it's going to become a lifelong practice for me. However, I seem to be having some trouble staying comfortable long enough to finish my meditation. My meditation sessions will run from about 18-40 minutes. Somewhere in there. Sometimes I get deep into meditation and I don't really want to come out. And as such, I'd like to get your recommendations on staying comfortable. 

I started out trying to do what the monks do, just sitting on the bare floor. It's just too hard. So I then switched over to what some of the other monks do, which is to sit on top of a couple of pillows. This helped out a lot, but I still have an issue with circulation to my right foot. Towards the end of my meditation, my right foot will tingle and go to sleep. I hate that any time it happens. But as you know if you start shifting around trying to get comfortable, it starts bringing you out of meditation. Then it may take awhile to get back in as deep as you were. This is not ideal. 

If I meditate in my big comfortable recliner chair, then I can usually avoid the foot and leg discomforts. But since it's a recliner chair, I can't really keep my back straight. At least not very easily. This leads to me starting to fall asleep during meditation. Can't have that. So I'd just like to hear what you guys do, and your recommendations on how to stay comfortable enough to keep meditating for extended periods. I'd eventually like to get to the point where I can meditate all day long and not really notice that time has passed, similar to what a Yogi can do.",0
"Hello friends,

I am new to meditation. I am very anxious person and feel like I say/do things slightly based on external factors (trying to impress people, trying to paint a certain image of myself to others etc). I want to be true to myself. I think meditation is the first step towards this and I have felt progress  occasionally. My problem is that I don’t really know how to do it. E.g I search 30min for a guided meditation on Youtube and put the responsibility of having ”succesful” meditation on the guided meditation... Sounds weird maybe. I also don’t breath/inhale naturally, it almost feels like a task.

I hope some of you with more experience can help me with this. Should I meditate without any guidence/music? What tactics are there that I can use in the beginning before it starts coming to me naturally.

Than you in advance.",0
"Hi. I’ve been meditating for quite awhile now on and off. My longest everyday streak was a month back in June. Around that time, I felt vibrations all over my body probably once or twice, other then that I really just followed vipassana. I picked up the practice again about a week and a half ago and I’ve noticed my meditations are a lot stronger/sharper and I experience waves of euphoria about 8 minutes in. This has happened 3 times already. These waves are not just body vibrations. They come in waves and I feel it on my brain. It feels similar to taking pure mdma. I feel super cozy like someone just put a blanket over my brain. Anyone else?


I also wanted to add that I have been practicing r/semenretention since the beginning of the year. It could be that I’m transmuting my sexual energy as well.",0

I’ll preface this by saying I experimented with a lot of psychedelics many years ago. Does anyone else who has experience with psychedelics find that the realm we enter in deep meditation is remarkably similar to the come up of a trip? Or even people who have not tried any psychedelic drugs?

It feels almost like a mild dmt trip. 

..doors of perception open up, and you stop filtering so much sensory input..

The experience is completely different, but I feel like I go to the same place

"Wanted to just share a video that I finally completed about everything that I learned: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmdc6Xm7LK0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmdc6Xm7LK0)

And if you don't want to watch the video here's the written part: I recently completed a 10 day meditation retreat. 

One where you are supposed to find out about yourself. Where you achieve enlightenment, where you don't speak to anyone for 10 days and you really get to know yourself. And you get to find out what really matter to you. 

But the reality is, it's a lot of you trying to focus on your breath, and the feelings in your body, but primarily you realize just how little control over your mind you have. 

You’re focusing on your breath, and then you’re thinking about how your leg hurts. Then you’re thinking about how long this session has been, then you’re wondering if everything is okay at home. And then you realize that you’ve spent the last 10 minutes not worrying about your breath and just getting pulled in whatever direction your mind wanted to go. 

This was a common occurrence during the retreat, and to be honest, one of the reasons we need to go. So that we can see how our mind works, and so we can learn about ourselves. 

Now I had heard through numerous friends that the retreat was life changing. That you’ll discover what truly matters to you. You’ll organize everything in your life. You’ll know what you need to stop doing, or do more of. What you actually care about. 

But I also heard that you shouldn’t have expectations, or you’d be outcome dependent. And you should just let the meditation teach you what you’re meant to be taught. 

So these were my expectations going in. To have no expectations. To trust the process, and to let go. 

I’ll explain what I *actually* learned in this meditation retreat, but first I’d like to tell you a little bit about the retreat so you know what to expect. 

First and foremost, there’s a lot of meditation. 

Who would have thought? There’s about 7-8 hours of meditation per day. Starting at 4:30 in the morning.  

To start the retreat, you’re expected to take 5 precepts, to maintain your Sila, which is hindi for Morality.   

Abstain from killing

Abstain from stealing 

Abstain from sexual activity 

Abstain from telling lies 

Abstain from all intoxicants

It seems easy enough, right? You aren’t talking so you can’t really tell lies. This is why noble silence is in place, because we will lie without even meaning to. 

And how often do you kill throughout the day? That’ll be no problem. But you’d be surprised how hard it is to maintain this precept when you’re lying in bed trying to sleep and there’s a mosquito flying beside your ear. 

Where your entire being wants to just slap it and end the problem for good. But now you have to delicately cup it in your hands and carry it out to the hallway. 

So those are the precepts and the whole purpose of the retreat is to acquire wisdom. The wisdom to realize that everything rises, and passes away. And that change is constant. 

But there are three types of wisdom, or panna. And not all panna is equal. Here’s a story: Say you’re starving to death and you go into a restaurant. The waiter gives you the menu and you peruse it over. The food looks so delicious, so tasty in the pictures. The descriptions are great. You have cinta - maya - panna. Wisdom gained by intellectual understanding. The menu looks good.   

While you’re waiting for food, you look around at all the happy families already eating. They all are smiling and enjoying their meals. You have suta maya panna - wisdom gained by listening to others. 

And then finally your meal comes and you get to dig in. And oh my lord is it ever good. Everyone was right. You know have bhavana maya panna - wisdom gained from direct personal experience. 

And this level of wisdom is the deepest kind. The wisdom that everything rises and passes away and that nothing is good or bad. It’s easy to understand intellectually, but we needed to go deep, and we needed to gain this understanding on our own. 

So the meditation has you sharpening your awareness, so you are able to pick up subtle sensations throughout your body and watch them rise, and pass away. 

This is something you’ll do on the meditation retreat. You spend 10 long, long days doing this. And to tell you the truth, it was the longest 10 days of my life. 

I didn’t get any of the wisdom that I was told would happen. My entire life didn’t get put into order. When i came out, i didn’t have unlimited focus for working on projects. 

But here’s what I did get: During this long 10 days, I spent a lot of time just feeling like this will last forever, that I’m never going to get out of this, and that I can’t wait to talk again or see my family again, but it felt like that would never happen. 

But when i came out of the retreat, I realized that it was actually temporary. And that everything, is temporary, and that is very freeing. It made me more capable to take risks in my life, because I now have the wisdom that everything really does rise and pass away. 

And this helped me to break down the barriers that i have in my life that are stopping me from going after what I want. I used to have fear, but now I can understand that everything is transient and even if i put myself in a nerve wracking situation, that too, like everything else, will pass. So may as well face your fears. 

The meditation retreat never taught me the things I was told it would, and I didn’t ever fully surrender and achieve enlightenment. But the benefits that i did get have resonated within me and helped in my life. I would recommend a retreat to anyone, even if it’s just to see what you’re made of. To prove to yourself that you’re capable of anything that you set your mind to. That’s the real benefit that i received from the meditation retreat. I can tell you that coming out of something as difficult as this, I definitely felt confidence that I could tackle bigger and scarier things, and felt the courage to attempt them.",0
"Every time I sit down to meditate I really don’t know what I’m expecting, right now I’m at a huge crossroads in my life and I think meditation is in order but I’ve never meditated before and want to start. I know the answer to everything isn’t just going to pop in my head but I just feel silly sitting down and meditating and then my back starts hurting and my minds all over the place I just think it would help me if I knew what exactly it was I was trying to achieve by meditating",0

" Can you see that thinking can be used only for describing something? 

All other assertions of thinking - (Why I do not get desired results despite my best efforts? Why our relationships do not remain smooth? Why there is negativity all around? Why one is stressed? Why there is wavering while taking any decision? Why one feels angry? Why sometimes you are labeled when there is no fault of yours? And so on)-in the form of any answer give you relief from the discomfort the moment is showing. One is trapped in securing this relief. The touch of the Original is missed.

Dependence upon explanations, practices create the impression as if (psychological) discomfort will be removed from the mind. Energy remains dissipated.",0

My therapist recommended I try journaling instead. I’ve tried it both online and on paper but neither have really clicked for me. I’ve been doing it on and off for so long.

"Hi all! Thank you for your time :)

With 10 years of overthinking (as many of you I guess), which led to anxiety/panic attacks/derealization I can totally say that meditation is helping me a lot!There are a few struggles though:

* As I keep doing this I'm noticing that it's getting more and more difficult! I mean, it seems that in the first months I could keep my focus on the breath more easily. Now? I have a turbolence of intricate thoughts and as soon as I rest my attention on the breath it immediately ""morphs"" to another image. Then I notice it, label it, return to the breath and here it goes again immediately. I'm accepting them as they rise and I try not to resist them, but why are them that many now?
* During the day, when I realize I'm distracted, should I focus on just one thing (breath, activity) or should I try to experience the whole range of senses?
* As I mentioned before, I was used to experience dissociative disorders. Now I feel more grounded but it's still pretty rare for me to sense clarity and depth when I look at something or experience something. When I do, it's great, but when I don't it's like I'm watching it through a filter that evens/fogs it out. Any suggestion on how to improve the clarity moments?

Thank you so much for you patience.",0
"This has been a problem for some time, but I noticed that whenever I meditate my head begins to move involuntarily up and down.

"Emotions commonly manifest through physical sensations, if you have a sensation in your body and you associate it with an specific story, memory, emotion, trauma, etc, you will condition these feelings to the physical sensation as well.

The human body is a very complicated system that is in constant motion, change and a never ending cascade of chemical processes, most of them we don't even have control or awareness of.

If you feel something in your body, evaluate it for what it actually is, a physical sensation.
Do you get a cramp on your abdomen? or a pain in your left arm? Identify these primitive physical sensations that we are unable to control for what they truly are: primitive physical sensations that we are unable to control.

The fact that you regularly meditate has been training your brain to accomplish this task, you are already a good step ahead.

In my personal experience and during my own meditation I've noticed time and time again the truth about how my body has been keeping the score of what has emotionally happened to me in the past. I consider myself a prime example of how to handle these sensations in the worst possible way because I was adding tons of emotional context to a given physical sensation, which is no different from contaminating an open wound.

Physical sensations are not books, they don't need you to treat them as such.

Acknowled them without getting involved with them, let them be. In due time, they will stop happening.",0

"Been a mediator for few years now. In recent past I'm having very strange experience during meditation. I close my eyes and start slow but deep breathing. About 15-20 mins into meditation, (by then I'm into deep meditative state), I suddenly start to see extremely bright flash of light, right in center of eye brows. It's just a very tiny dot that randomly appears but it's so bright that I feel, as if, a nuclear missile is piercing through my forehead. It would be there for a fraction of second, but the effect it creates is so profound, that my entire body starts to shake as if I'm being electrocuted. But, it feels so blissful that words are not enough to describe the experience and I keep shivering for almost 2-3 mins in pure bliss / ecstasy. I end up crying (with joy of course) some times and after effect this experience is just amazing. Thing is, this not an isolated experience that I had. Recent past such occurrences have become quite often and very much repetitive. Initially I thought that it may have been a random experience, but as I had such experience very often, I conclude that it's definitely not random.

- I have to sleep. 
- Thought : you have to sleep 
- Outcome : I’m more awake and nervous 


or 

I have to make a presentation 
- thought: Don’t be nervous for this presentatation 
- outcome : I’m nervous 

this goes along with many other things. Times when you have to “perform” 

How do I manage this? Is mediation a way to get rid of it ? Are there some techniques for it ? 

Many thanks in advance !",0
"Hi All,

Noobie here, I feel my meditation is definitely progressing but I have a couple basic questions and I apologize if these have been answered before. I've read a lot of this form about observing your thoughts without judgement. Sometimes I find myself trying not to think and focusing on my breath and I feel great but the thoughts slowly keep creeping back in. Should I just let them loose and stop trying to fight it? Also, how do you imagine yourself ""observing"" your thoughts in the 3rd person? Lastly, how important is posture verses comfort-ability. I have a leather reclining chair but I have been sitting up in it with my back straight, should I continue to do this or should I sacrifice posture for comfort?",0

"I see the word ""ruminating"" thrown around a lot in meditation discussions. It seems to usually be used in a negative way, as if it's something to avoid.

I always sort of figured ""meditation"" and ""rumination"" meant the same thing (to ponder deeply on something), but it seems to be different in terms of actual meditation practice.

Can someone explain to me?",0
"First thing to do when your learning meditation is to not get caught up in thoughts by not contradicting why they exist and mainly not adding extra energy towards them. The basic goal is to clear your mind but it cannot be done intellectually. If I tell you to fall asleep you won't be able to do it. You have to Fall into meditation not go into meditation.

Leaving thoughts alone is not easy at the start because our mind does not work at the level of ""addition"" and ""subtraction"". It can multiply and divide something. Hense by trying to suppress or trying not to think of something only amplifies the thought you're trying to run away from.

The best tip to just observe the thoughts is to let the thoughts be just the way they are till will come and they will go by starting to not get involved with them, they won't rule your attention

Using an app like headspace will help a lot. Try doing the free 10-day Headspace Basics they explain a lot of fundamental things. If the basics are there things a lot easier.",0

"You guys, I'm in some serious trouble. I've never considered myself to be an angry or ragey individual, but competitive conditions turn me into the biggest bastard I've had the displeasure of witnessing. It's one of the greatest faults of mine that I'm embarrassed about. Throughout my life, I've always admired individuals who could keep a cool head in stressful conditions and make the best of any given situation. I've idolized these people. But I just can't seem to follow their example. Whenever things start to get rough, my body pumps me full of adrenaline and other chemicals and I just start spiraling down his metaphorical stairway of self-loathing and constantly decreasing performance. I can't handle it anymore and this part of make makes me genuinely disgusted with myself. 

Which brought me to the topic of meditation. Some really successful athletes and competitors engage in meditation and it really seems to help their performance. I'm trying to get into it as well but the online guides are not quite clear on this stuff. I just sit for at least ten minutes a day and breathe? Do I actively try to think about something? Think about nothing? How do I do this? And if I master it, will it make me zen as fuck? I want to be an immovable mountain of mental, Buddha's long lost son. Is that something I can attain via meditation? Or am I just condemned to a life of being a little stressed out bitch because of unfortunate DNA combinations?

"Hi, 

Lately, I've been practicing meditation by observing the natural breath and then moving on to body sensations. It's come to my notice that I am sleeping early and I wake up early too. Yesterday, I slept at 10 pm and woke up at 3 am. That's 5 hours of sleep. Even the five hours of sleep that I had, was almost about the sensations I felt. The thing is, it felt different. It felt like I had no deep sleep. I'm not sure if this affects my daily behavior if it's a positive attribute of meditating or a negative one.",0

"As a psychology student and meditator, I’m wondering if there’s any scientific research on which meditation techniques are most effective. It’s not that I want to condemn any technique, but if we want to gain the benefits of meditation and certain techniques are better than others, it makes sense that we ought to use science to discover which meditation techniques are most effective. 

The techniques I would like to compare are: Transcendental, mindfullness, and vipassana. Having practiced all three, I would expect theme to rank from least effective to most effective in that order. By effective I mean purify and calm the mind. 

Are there some more techniques for us to consider? What do you think of my choice of ranking? Any ideas on scientific studies of meditation? 

Thank you",0
"19 year old male, gonna try to keep  it short. Basically for the past 3 years i have been pushing a career that is not going anywhere, no friends , no job, no university no money. I became neurotic as fuck having tried super hard on my career path and seeing no results after so long. The only one good thing is I guess that I am conscious of it, but I can't even exist normally without thoughts on suicide and depression. My question is, if I meditated for x hours everyday could I atleast live normally? I have read about the dark night of soul, a lot of negative effects of insane meditation hours everyday, is this all a myth or is it true?

"I've been doing a mindfulness breathing meditation 5 days per week for about a month now. Usually for 10 minutes. However I often check my timer during the meditation when I get antsy and want to know how long I have left. It's not mindful. I also often scratch my face or my hair or reposition myself from sitting to laying to sitting again because experiencing all the sensations is so uncomfortable.

Yesterday I couldn't make it through my 15 minute sit and was very frustrated. 

Today I set a timer for 12 minutes and made it the entire time barely moving an inch. It was pretty amazing to feel the sensations arise and then disappear again. However amazing as it was it was also extraordinarily difficult and painful. 

I am very proud and it was very powerful to sit through it all, but the idea of doing 12 minutes again seems very difficult even though I just accomplished it not 5 minutes ago. 

Is it wise to reduce the time while adhering to this much more strict practice of not moving an inch, say starting at 5 mins and building up a minute each day?

Or should I just do 13 minutes tomorrow? Any thoughts?",0

"I am relatively new to mediation, and have recently transitioned from following Headspace to participating in a weekly class with a teacher, which has been mindblowing in its difference. A few weeks ago our teacher introduced us to black &amp; white breathing; during that time I began to feel a spreading warmth coming from my core (not sure how else to explain it?), which ended slowly a few minutes after we were done the meditation. Every time since, but only when doing black &amp; white breathing, I find I experience this warm, cozy feeling that starts off gradually and then increases and spreads. I've never experienced this before, but after reading the FAQs am wondering if this is just a distraction of my mind? Or is this a positive development of my meditation practice? Not sure what I'm hoping to get with this question, but any advice would be helpful as I am so new to this. Thank you muchly!",0
"I woke up this morning without struggle. Sunlight fell on my eyes, raising me from sleep and I did not fight it. I took my shower, brushed my teeth, and dressed for the day in peace and quiet. No anxieties about what today might hold or ruminations about what transpired yesterday. 

Breakfast is next on my schedule. I like bacon and eggs every morning that I have time to make it. I put on the coffee, and cook the food. Coffee smells wonderful while it is brewing, bacon sounds like morning rain, and eggs are still challenging to make the way I like. 

Breakfast is ready and I eat it outside on the back porch in the sunlight. I do not feel the need to be distracted by a book, TV show, or podcast. There is no place I would rather be than right here, right now, alive and eating. 

Time for class. Chemistry is difficult, but I am focused in lecture. What matters right now is the material, not what I got on the last exam or when my next one is. I lose myself in the beauty of science. 

Now to study. I can use this time to plan ahead, instead of stressing about it in class or at home. I plot out my future exams and due dates without too much worry.

Time for calculus. I get my quiz back and I know the grade was what I deserved. Move on to the material. A peaceful mind is a fertile garden for math. I lose myself in the beauty of math. 

Lunch time. I go home and eat a sandwich. The day is moving along now and I might read a book with lunch. Time is precious!

Time for chemistry lab. My favorite part of the school week. I arrive on time and eager, set up my lab station, and begin to work. The work goes on for three hours, but I might as well have been in there for a half hour. 

After lab I finally go home for the day. I cook dinner and with it I might watch a movie, lecture, or concert video. I've earned as much after the day. 

Before bed, I meditate. It takes some time, but the skittering trains of thought dissipate until my mind is left in quiet. 

I go to sleep with a clear head and wake up in the morning with the same.

EDIT: I mean not every day is like this... I’ve just been having good days lately!",0
"For sometime something within me has felt ""off"". I felt drawn to meditation, as some sort of remedy perhaps. When reading the FAQ I gravitated towards metta / loving kindness. 

For the past week I've been sending metta only to myself. My first session I cried. Since, my awareness of my thoughts has increased and it sadness me to say but I feel like I fundamentally think from a place of sadness, fear and hurt. I'm on the defensive. 

I usually feel low after my sessions have finished but somehow feel there is some benefit, even if it's just the ability to be more honest with myself. My thoughts and ways of thinking weren't that clear to me before starting metta. 

I hope I'm on the right path and one day I'll feel lovingkindess towards myself. I also realise metta is just one piece of the puzzle to improving my relationship with myself.",0
I’ve been wanting to start meditating regularly and I’ve done mindfulness stuff before so I kinda know some stuff about it. I just did my first session with headspace and I was maybe halfway through and I felt like I was spinning. I’ve had vertigo in the past that wakes me from my sleep and makes me throw up and this was too familiar.  I tried to block it out but it got stronger and I did not want to get sick so I opened my eyes and it was gone.  So I thought it was a fluke and closed my eyes again and it instantly started again.  I just tried to ignore it again until it got intense and I needed to confirm that it wasn’t actually happening again.  Same thing happened and it stopped as soon as I opened my eyes. I have been able to lucid dream a lot and I don’t even try anymore and I’ve enjoyed lucid dreaming a lot. Could that have anything to do with this feeling with meditation.  The spinning is accompanied by lightheaded ness and I did think it was my breathing so I made sure to focus on that more and make sure it wasn’t just me hyperventilating but the sensation continued throughout the rest of the session.  The time flew by and seemed like nothing at all so I’ll be continuing but I was wondering if anyone has had similar things happen to them where the sensation doesn’t carry over when you open your eyes. If anyone knows what this might be or has advice that would be great!,0

Hope you’re all well. 
When I get into a deep meditative state, and my breathing is extremely shallow and relaxed, my head gradually tilts back 90 degrees, so that I’m “looking” at the ceiling.

"Hi everyone, 

There is no doubt about the benefits of meditation. Its scientifically proven fact. However, can you please elaborate on those idea 

1) how can I, when in anger or negative state, bring my mind to sit and focus on my breathing (now) without feeling my brain chatter and anxiety. 

2) how can I feel that for only 5 minutes a day meditating, my life would change for the better. I just cannot see the correlation. Since 5 minutes is only a short part of my whole 24 hours a day cycle. So 4-5 hours later from my session, I could get angry or something. 

Thank you for kind support and help,",0
"**Perception is a representation of reality but can never be a reality, but it exists within the realm of reality so it is a reality.**

My Friends, This may seem like a paradox. The question here is do you want to be finite or infinite? Limited or Unlimited?

Consciousness is not a perception of life;  But Perception emerges from Consciousness. By consciously dissolving the perception to become absolutely ""Dynamic"" with the life process which is everything that you can be aware of this moment will allow perception to merge with life, it will allow perception to fall into consciousness to a point where perception does not exist but just consciousness remains. Just as the fog clears and the light becomes clearer.

**""Dynamic State""** **simply means that you are able to flow with water of creation by collapsing the dams within your mind.** In reality, you're always flowing but not consciously aware due to creating **""Rigid""** perceptions that is nothing but dualistic contradiction caused by miss aligning with the dynamic flow of consciousness. One such example is thinking about the past and future tense.

By living in perceptions upon perception may seem complex but you're only limiting your own awareness to be finite. By being in the dynamic state your transcending dualism and aligning your self towards life.

Once you start becoming Dynamic by being consciously aware of life more and more things will reveal about **""Now""** / **""Present""**

**Now your perception is the same as absolute reality. Seeing things just the way they are without any false representations.**",0
"I've been picking up on some background chatter in my meditations recently. Every time I noticed them, I would realize they didn't make any sense. In my session today, I realized that I could recreate a similar chatter by just starting with any word and immediately coming up with the next words from the first thing that pops in my head, exactly like autocorrect.

Here are some examples:

""The tea leaves fall daintly from the walls corner.""

""Hypogenic states come from all pieces of time.""

""Happiness is a great undoing of society.""

Has anyone had this before? I know it's nothing to worry about it, but I'm curious how this mechanism works, from a psychological pov. I'm a very verbal thinker and I wonder if my internal speech stops making sense when I stop giving it the resources of effort and focus. In that case, it's almost like neurons firing at random, without any conscious control, which is why I get word associations that make it sound like autocorrect.",0

"He’s a pretty normal dude who’s one of our best friends. He’s super smart and he’s hilarious when he opens up but sometimes you can tell he isn’t happy or isn’t present when we’re hanging out. Tbh he can be kind of a downer sometimes, but we love him.

Anyways, the other night (after a few drinks) he asked me to help him. He told me he’s feeling kinda alone, he thinks that he has plenty of friends but that he doesn’t have any “deep” relationships with any of them. He says he’s trying to be more confident and outgoing but that he’s struggling. I think he really wants to date one of our friends but that she’s probably not into him like that.

"Hello, I've been really into mindfulness lately, from daily meditation to therapy to reading books and it's helped so much in understanding my anxiety.

So once I got my hands on The Untethered Soul after reading so many good reviews I was very excited. But to tell you the truth, I couldnt get past the first few pages without it triggering some anxiety within me. When it started talking about the ""voice in my head"" that he believes is what can cause someone's anxiety. And how he says to say something in your head, then goes on to explain how that is not you. I began thinking ""oh great theres voices in my head"" lol and you may see where this is going lol. So now every time I meditate and I start observing my thoughts I end up getting anxious when I start ""talking to myself"", i think oh this is not me even though I'm actively thinking of the words, and it just spirals from there.

So for those who read the book, can you explain more about this voice the author is referring too. And does he mean literally anytime you think of anything in your head it is not you? 

I understand that negative thoughts and ruminating thoughts are come and go not by your choice, that I've accepted and its helped me alot. But when it comes to actively thinking and saying things ""in your head"". I begin to worry 'is that also not by my choice?' Since that ""voice"" is not me. When I'm doing math homework is it not me that is rattling off these formulas in my head?


Hopefully you understand my dilemma I'm in. I really want to continue and read the whole book but it seems everytime I try to understand the who ""voice"" thing my anxiety starts to raise and I get confused.

"So I am a college student, and I have been trying to meditate every day for the past month. I usually do about 10-15 min in the morning and then about 30 min to fall asleep at night. I've missed a few days, but overall I've tried to stick to my plan. I hadn't realized many changes to my overall mindset, but I was hopeful positive changes would come.

I'm currently taking a super difficult class and the first midterm exam was last week. I really really studied for it; went to all the office hours, created study guides, made flashcards of every note. At one of the professor's office hours, a few students and I were collaboratively working on solving problems. After the session finished, two of the students came up to me and wanted me to join their study group because 'you know the material better than anyone in there'. I joined their study group and was feeling like I would score pretty good on this exam. 

And today the exam results were posted and I earned a whopping 30%. 

The first thought that flashed into my mind was absolute shock and terror, but then my brain stopped and I thought about the Buddha quote 'The past is already gone, the future is not yet here. There's only one moment for you to live, and that is the present moment.' 

I think that means it's working?",0

It felt like my point of reference was sliding back and away from my head until my body was smaller and smaller.

I notice I get very calm in the latter stage of a meditation session. Its pretty noticeable as my deep breathing becomes more automatic and my heart beats slower. I was just curious as to how or why this happens? I practice mindfulness meditation using my breath as a focus point. 

Could the calmness be because of my deep slow breathing thus leading to more oxygen in my body. Or maybe because  the longer I go in a session the quieter and less frequent my thoughts become thus calming my mind, leading to a overall calmness in the rest of my body. 

This calm feeling is something I only feel when meditating. Throughout the day my heart is usually beating fast and when I become aware of my breath I'll notice it's always short shallow breathing.",0

"Hi everyone. I realize there is a growing body of scientific literature about the health benefits of meditation. However, if you search the internet you also see a lot of ""information"" about how meditation can be harmful in some individuals - as in worsening anxiety or depression. My question is, is anyone aware of any actual literature or research that shows these negative side effects? I guess I'm trying to figure out if a website promoting meditation would need to have a disclaimer about possible side effects or are these negative side effects just speculation or unstudied personal experiences without scientific backing.

For example, I believe Headspace got in trouble a while back for making claims about meditation's health benefits with aggressive marketing techniques towards the elderly and was fined by the FTC. On the other hand, most physical ""alternative/homeopathic"" health products at the store are okay to sell with un-founded health claims with ""not evaluated by the FDA"" disclaimers as long as the product doesn't cause any actual harm (FTC allows this). I guess I'm kind of edging on the legal side of things, but I'm not sure how meditation, as a product such as what headspace sells, wouldn't be allowed to have the same type of disclaimers that physical alternative health products have - but this would also depend on if meditation could possibly have negative side effects, and if those side effects have been in studies.

Anyway, back to my question: is there any actual evidence about meditation causing unwanted side effects? Thanks!",0

I been meditating everyday (with a few oops days) for about 8 months. 20 minutes every morning using a combination of noticing breath and silent repetition of phrases that I've made up which I find to be inspiring and helpful to to me personally.

In the book the author is quite specific about what a mantram should be and basically tells you that your mantram should be chosen from a list he gives. I'm conflicted by this as I feel I've had great results from my meditation practice in which I use my personal mantram. 
I would love to get some thoughts from others on this topic.",0

We definitely know on this subreddit that meditation has almost endless benefits to your personal health if done right.  But what if you found out that you could join a mass meditation and not only heal yourself, but actually help bring peace and healing to the planet?

The above link is one very effective mass meditation that, if you take part in, will surely help move our planet closer to a timeline of world peace. Please give it a chance and try it out. 

Meditating certainly isn't the only way you can help to create peace. There is much that needs to happen in the physical realm as well. But a 15 minute mass meditation can't hurt! Heres some proof of the positive effects of mass meditation on the community:

 You can do the meditations on this site, even if it is not the exact time of  the meditation schedule. There are also many other different mass meditations on the home page of the website I linked.

The following two links are a few free pages about how to do the merkaba meditation (recreating your human lightbody)-

And this is the updated version straight from the book:

This meditation, if done while feeling love energy, will release negativity and blockages from your chakras and open them up, thus restoring proper energy flow in your body, and improving your health. It can also change your consciousness to a higher dimensional awareness of peace, love and harmony with all life everywhere.


I highly suggest giving this meditation a try. Here is a guided audio link on YT of the merkaba meditation:




https://youtu.be/81Kf3UBQ1g8




Its from the book ""the ancient secrets of the flower of life part 2"".  The book also teaches spiritual anatomy of your 13 chakras,  healing, psychic powers, how to cast out entities/demons from your energy field, how to reconnect to mother earth,  the cosmos and your higher self,  and talks about a few intergalactic conspiracies and the current great awakening!


Here's a few pages from the book about the Lucifer experiment and how we can stop judgment and transcend this duality:

Here is another very useful meditation called the unity breath. It goes hand in hand with merkaba meditation. It will allow you to tap into a stream of infinite healing love energy:

"This is my greatest fear when it comes to energetic development, and it is very common it seems in proponents of Nofap and semen retention. I don't disapprove of such activities, in fact I think they can be highly valuable, but it seems many people either through meditation and/or practising semen retention/Nofap build more energy then they are capable of dealing with, and it leaks out into way over the top creepy behavior and excessive marvelling over oneself, often with complete ignorance, gaining this sort of attitude of always being the teacher and never taking anything to heart other than themselves.

Whether you agree with me or not, I'm not really concerned, but for those of you that do, you know what I am talking about. I would like to have some physical copy of a guide or something in proximity throughout my life, so that when I read it I can get a wake up call and adjust my behaviour accordingly. Perhaps a guidebook to good conduct as a spiritual practitioner or something, or perhaps even covering spiritual mania!

"I believe I have experienced a breakthrough which has come from through my mediation practice. 

I have always been one to get upset when I feel evenly slightly threatened. This can be by a comment of any kind, whether its intentions are benign or not. 

Recently, I have become aware that these comments that normally cause me to get upset are a result of feeling my ego attacked. Having become aware of this has allowed me to see things and hear things  for what they are without my ego. This has helped with my marriage tremendously because I now am aware of when my ego is threatened (for illogical reasons), and continue with a constructive dialogue. 

I feel as though walking through the world being aware of my ego has allowed me to be free of it. I realize all of these things that I used to do simply for my ego. The veil has been lifted. 

I hope I can continue on this path.",0

"Hi, 

So while I was meditating, casually starting off with observing my breath and then later moving to my body sensations, I had tremendous insight into the past, which was personal.

Something I can do on my lunch break and when I’m home from work, because sitting and browsing my phone isn’t very stimulating and I feel like I could be doing more. But I always think about the hobby, writing for example, and sort of psych myself out. I think “I don’t know what to write” or “I’ll never be a good writer” or compare myself unfairly to others. And it deters me from actually doing it. I can’t seem to shake these thoughts even after centering myself.

To elaborate, I am 21 years old and I study in my local uni, I had a wonderful experience when I started meditation, I could feel lighter, happier and more focus but as the time went by I can not seem to get myself in order.

"So I know that there are thoughts in my head as surely as writing this. And they are about the same. They are words. 

Well. When I meditated with my eyes closed when I first began meditating I found beneath these words there were images and symbols and pictures. 

And then I found beneath those images there was silence and space. 

Now, for mindfulness meditation (either sitting or walking around just living) I've found it more difficult to find space between thoughts. Yet still I often find I am mindful in a way that I am simply being. That I don't have any verbal thoughts in my mind (to watch. They just aren't there). 

BUT! I think even though I am in a space between thoughts and I am fully present, there still seems to be a landscape of feelings and impressions and not images, but ideas etc, sort of a subconscious thinking. 

I think that meditating has built a bridge between these conscious (verbal) thoughts and these unconscious (not verbal) thoughts. And actually it's kind of shitty. Because they are generally uncomfortable. 

Now it just occurred to me that I can also watch there unconscious (imagery not verbal) thoughts as I do with my conscious (verbal) thoughts. That I can step back and allow them as well. Only they are sort of nebulous. So I am not sure how that will go. Sorry. Seriously. Just stepped back to look at this unconscious landscape. 

My question is: can anyone else relate? I never hear anyone else talk about this second layer of thoughts that doesn't use words. Actually I think it's two more layers. 

Words/verbal 
Imajery/symbols
Feelings/intimations of memories

Anyway. I can't be the only one who has noticed this. 

Do you have thoughts underneath your thoughts that aren't verbal?",0

"Hello! As the title says, I think I have ruined meditation for myself. For the first part, when I try to not have expectations or try not to thing of something, I do and I cant seem to get out of the loop. I also have trouble focusing on things because when I try to focus, I bring it up as a thought in my head and it feels so forced, and I try to accept it and push it away but sometimes it even hurts my brain, and some thoughts just get forced away. I know yall are gonna be talking about how this is normal, but I dont thinkt my situation is. I think i have turned meditation into something bad, after every meditation i feel no more calm whatsoever, sometimes even worse. Back to the forcing thoughts away thing, it creates a weird feeling up in the top of my head, sometimes even induces headaches. This all came about when I started trying to be comfortable with anxiety I believe, forcing negative thoughts away. When you're told you need to accept thoughts as they come, I tend to put full focus on those thoughts, and in a way push them off without ever feeling like they are truly gone, more like I'm just putting more attention on them.
I can ramble forever and try to describe what is wrong but that would be a long post. One more thing is that I cant seem to let go of expectations.

If any of you share similar experiences or can help me I would appreciate it so much. Thank you all!",0
" Anyone ever listen to a tape maybe in the 1980s that started ""Welcome to a new beginning..""? It was a meditation tape spoken by a man meant to help you sleep and mostly discussed self confidence.

He says he can still hear the tape in his head some nights when he really can't sleep. We were talking recently and he explained that he wish he could hear the tape again because the memory is slowly fading and I really want to help him out.

"Have you ever noticed your emotions tend to be pretty consistent or similar day in, day out? 
 I'm really absorbing some concepts so I'll articulate them the best I can.
Recently, after I started meditating I noticed my thoughts were damn near the same each day. Before meditating I would notice this but still fall into them. 
Wake up:oh no, don't wanna go to work. Go to work, make dumb jokes, see cute girls, rationalize not approaching, beat myself up for it, tell myself to stop beating myself up, laugh and decide to become present. 
This is a short comical version obviously. But this theme kept playing out and I realized I was ""stuck"" 

Now just days later, I'm starting to notice this and wow, it's right on target. Anyways, based on the way we see ourselves and our beliefs about our current situation (and how we view ourselves navigating that situation)  that will determine our feeling about that situation, which in turn feeds into our self concept. In essence, creating a loop, or self fulfilling prophecy. 
Our body has a need to feel these feelings, almost like an addiction. Have you ever met people that seek out drama? Even if you're not causing problems with them, they will still find a way to get their fill of problems. Even if it means creating problems to get there. 
In addition, let's say you loved hip hop but then you went to jail. To fulfill your needs you'd probably rap or sing songs to yourself in your head. 
So, consider trying this.. especially if you're generally a depressed, angry, or anxious person. Watch your thoughts and feelings for atleast 3 days. Pay special attention to the times and places your feelings occur, and to recurring themes.

With meditation, you begin to notice this, notice your thoughts, understand what your beliefs are and understand that you choose your own beliefs, you choose your own reactions and ultimately your reality.
It's not an easy process, but I can't think of anything more fulfilling than the ability to choose your own destiny rather than letting your destiny choose you.",0

"A few weeks ago while I was meditating and sometbing I found really interesting happened.

I was doing one of the Headspace meditations where they have you focus on the areas where your chakras are supposed to be located. I was getting into a good rhythm with my breathing and my ears started ringing very loud. From there I followed the meditation and focused on the different areas of my body. When I did this I could feel the pitch of the ringing change with each area I would focus on.

It felt like the ringing was coming from an outside source and I was suddenly able to manipulate where it traveled in my body if I focused hard enough. It kind of felt like I was playing my body like an instrument. And when it hit each area I would hear a different sound. The lower areas having a lower tone and the higher ones having a higher tone.

"I am finally making a concerted effort to foster and secure a routine meditation practice. I've been led enough to know that it can offer profound benefits to body and soul. I think that mine needs a good dose of clorox internally! :-) I am an Army Infantry veteran with a few combat tours as part of a reconnaissance unit. It's a rough way to go, but exciting. So there is that. In my life I have had to deal with a marriage that did not work, nearly dying three times in the space of a 7 months. 

1. July 2016: Car wreck that broke my back and gave me a traumatic brain injury

2. December 21 2016: Jumped from behind by three teens while walking my dog - took me down with a stick to the back of the head, then all 3 took turns literally, specifically stomping on my head. Giving the brain injury that I got in July a refresh, and made worse

3. March 2017: woke up by my daughter turning blue for some reason. My body for some reason decided to try out a case of nearly fatal pneumonia. Woke up in the ICU where I stayed for 5 days. 

Through all of that, my marriage that was under strain, broke. 

Now, I've had some extreme high level brain docs at a Emory U tell me that I have major depressive disorder and extreme PTSD as a result of all of the injuries. They strongly recommended meditation as a means to help control it all and get better. I have 38 years of martial arts experience, so I know the ability to focus is in here somewhere. 

But when it comes to facing up to that anxiety, the prospect of trying to mediate wins because my mind is so good at fighting back. And when I can finally sit and be mindful, all of the energy, rage, anger, confusion, make one helluva anxiety cocktail, that really comes extremely close to overwhelming me and winning back control from being free to disassociate and heal. 

I get the principle of focusing and bringing everything back to the breath. I know that I can acknowledge thoughts, and that I'm supposed to be able to recognize and release. Are there techniques that help one build a foundation to strengthen the internal resolve?

&amp;#x200B;

It dosen’t work with focusing on the breath since my breathing is breathing nonstop without pauses when I focus on it since I guess because it is to tight in sensations.
Any insight on how to deal with this?",0
"I was trying to answer this question while I was experiencing a transition from competitive, career oriented material life to a more balanced, near to nature, life based on meditation and spirituality. 

Couple of months back the realisation that came across was simple. spirituality and it's meaning is timeless and eternal . The definition or an understanding on what it does to you is a everlasting. It does not change with time, context, space or person. Or even based on feelings. 

Compared to ambition or success that has different definition at different times or with different people. Ambition necessarily let's u create a flow rather than be in flow. It creates points of stress because of ever-changing desires and needs. 

So how can it coexist?  Also spirituality in essence is joy in the present moment with no thought of past or future while ambition is all about competition and thoughts of future. 

Would love to hear thoughts!",0
"I’ve used headspace in the past with their few free sleepcasts and decided to just pay for a one month subscription to give it a shot.

Some stories are great, and I like the wind down audios but I absolutely despise the counting. I’ll be getting deep into my breathing and shutting off the muscles in my body for sleep- and they’ll say to count down from 10,000. I try to, but keeping track of my count is tough because my brain is already sleepy and now I’m awake again. 

Does anyone possibly know of any of their wind down audios that DON’T have the count down? It just stresses me out and I can’t stand it.",0

Script:

""God is ever-present and unchanging.

Life is the phenomenal universe and perpetually and exponentially growing oneness with God.

This can be compared to a logarithmic spiral, a shape commonly found in nature.

God can be compared to the origin, infinity.

And life can be compared to the spiral, which can be seen as a folded wave.

God, oneness, and Truth are complete peace and infinite love, just as the origin is the Heart at which the wave's amplitude approaches zero and its frequency approaches infinity.""

Full text from my site:

“God is ever-present and unchanging.

Life is the phenomenal universe (maya in Indian spiritual philosophy) and perpetually and exponentially growing oneness with God. (Beings who’re more one with God than humans are, such as the Creator, beings to whom worlds are thoughtforms, solar systems like atoms, and humans like cells, goddesses and gods, angels, legendary, celestial, magical, and other supernatural beings, extraterrestrials, and spirits, exist in higher and more majestic dimensions, such as heavens. Beings who're less one with God than humans are include animals, plants, and minerals.)

This can be compared to a logarithmic (equiangular) spiral, a shape commonly found in nature.

God can be compared to the origin, infinity.

(The origin is the center point that the spiral converges towards,

ϴ → ∞ using the polar equation r = aeb(-ϴ))

And life can be compared to the spiral, which can be seen as a folded wave.

God, oneness, and Truth are complete peace and infinite love, just as the origin is the Heart at which the wave's amplitude approaches zero and its frequency approaches infinity.

(We perpetually and exponentially grow towards Godliness, oneness, and our true Self and Heart, becoming nobler \[dedicated to universal, world, and inner peace\] \[complete peace, zero amplitude\], and stronger \[infinite love, infinity frequency\], like a logarithmic spiral perpetually and exponentially approaching its origin.)”

"So, over the weekend I read a few chapters from the very popular Eckhart Tolle book, The Power of Now, which I saw being recommended here a lot. Although I was moved by the teachings, and the idea that we only ever have the present moment, I found myself a bit distraught by the heavy spiritual nature and ""purpose of awakening"". Specifically, completely letting go of the past and the future and only thinking about the future when you want to plan something. I think my ego has been hurt so much by that and I don't feel very well lol. 

I do understand that constant preoccupation with the past or the future can lead to a lot of built up anxiety in one's life, but completely letting them go seems a bit extreme to me, and very watered down- Buddhist in nature.

Life is an art. And creating the life you want to live is also an art. We live in a world whose rules are defined by capitalism, and recognizing that is just being realistic. At the same time we also live in a world where opportunities to be who you want to be are more than ever, both in terms of personal expression and career wise.

So why would you want to let go of that, and let go of your dreams for the future, as long as they are realistic? And who defines what realistic is anyways? I believe you should manifest the life that you want to live, even if that includes material things. Material things are part of the human desire.

I guess what I try to take away from this book was to appreciate the life you have right now more. As well as trusting the process of your vision. Because to truly manifest what you want in life, without getting lost in anxiety, you first need to appreciate the present life that you do have, otherwise you're going to be stuck in a cycle of not ever feeling satisfied, and chasing unattainable highs.

So, to me that means appreciating the life I live right now and finding joy and gratitude in it, because there's a lot of both to be found. And basking in it. And using that as momentum to achieve my goals. And getting up every morning and fighting for my dreams. And realizing that even my short term goals right now, are in essence my big goals. But I'm also realistic about the fact that although I do find joy and immense gratitude in being middle class, I would be much happier being rich. (Just one example)

Happiness is a journey. And I believe that designing the life you want to live is true happiness. And ego is essential in that.

What do you guys think? Did I misunderstand the book or take it too pragmatically? Am I just too young and not ready to accept true awakening? Would I have gotten more resolution had I finished it?",0

"Hi guys

For the last 2 years I have explored the topic of Life After Death and what happens to our loved ones after they die. Losing a loved one 5 years ago led me to ask questions and seek answers outside of the rational everyday approach to life.   Beyond the Veil is a documentary I've been working on that is the culmination of this research, where I’ve had the chance to meet, interview and work with some of the most incredible teachers in the field. Their work has opened my eyes to a reality I could have never even dreamed of and one which I want to share with you all.

Beyond The Veil is a feature documentary that explores life after death. Told through the eyes of those born with the gift of communicating with the spirit world, this film shines a light on the evidence and personal accounts of what really happens in the afterlife.  Backed by the latest research on consciousness, Beyond the Veil is the first of its kind film that aims to bridge the gap between the psychic and scientific world and to provide hope and proof of the afterlife.    

Now, with 80% of the filming done, I need everyone’s support to help me see this vision come to completion and tell a story that deserves to be told and most importantly help those who are grieving. For the next month I am launching a fundraising campaign to help me fund the remaining funds in order to complete this story and send it out into the world.  I would hugely appreciate any support you can give me by clicking on the link below and sharing it on your SM.

"Hey everyone,
I have been practicing meditation very on and off for the past year or two and haven’t really made much progress. Recently, I started trying to sit again and it was going well for the first week or so. 
After the first week or so, after I meditated, I would just have a constant stream of thoughts rush through my head the rest of the day. I felt almost no control over them at all and it got to the point where it adversely affected my athletic performance. This has been a major contributor as to why I keep stopping and starting my practice and becomes more and more frustrating as time goes on. 
Has anyone experienced this problem before? If so, what are some potential steps to ameliorate the situation? Should I continue sitting and just ride through the difficulty or should I consider stopping for good? I almost feel as if I am repressing my thoughts during the meditation and they come out nonstop throughout the course of the day. Thanks for reading and for any help/advice at all!",0

"I've always loved the four noble truths of Buddhism because they're succinct, clear, and simple.

1. Existence is full of stress.

2. Stress is caused by urgency (tanha).

3. The relinquishment of urgency is the end of stress.

4. To relinquish urgency, follow this 8 step program! (The 8-fold path)

Tanha is often translated as ""desire,"" which makes people think they have to stop wanting things in order to relax or be happy. I think this is a mistake. It's also translated as ""craving,"" ""thirst,"" ""longing,"" ""greed"" or any other number of words, but these don't capture what tanha is as a concept.

The origin of suffering is not wanting things to be a certain way, or the desire to have something, it's the urgency behind a thought that causes strain. It's the difference between seeing a slice of cake after you're eaten a meal, and seeing one after you haven't eaten all day. It's the *right now* in the phrase, ""I want it *right now!*""

So, when I sit to meditate, I don't attempt to dissuade myself from wanting things. I know that my intentions are to make myself feel better, to relax, etc. and I don't have to stop wanting that. Instead, I attempt to let go of any sense of *urgency* behind my thoughts. You can do this rather simply with self talk. If you're worried about your bank account you can say, ""I don't have to check that right now, I can leave it till later."" If you're upset about a conversation you had earlier, you can say, ""I don't have to figure this out now, it can wait."" 

When you meditate, you are teaching yourself to let go of any sense of imperative behind your thoughts. ""Letting go"" doesn't mean trying to forget or push things away, because that, itself, is urgency. This is how any meditation practice can backfire and your method turns into a stressors itself. Instead, you let go by realizing you don't have to fix anything *right now*. You procrastinate your thoughts until all urgency fades, and you don't have any feelings pushing at you one way or another.

Then, practice that in daily life until you never feel a sense of urgency again.",0
"I had been meditating with positive affirmations for the past month but just over the last week I had decided to stop using them and just meditate (self guided) with some 432 hz calming music. Yesterday I had tried out a meditation method known as moon gazing and after that, everything seemed a little different

Anyways, today I mediated (self guided) for 15 minutes but this meditation stood out. My hands felt electric as if generating energy and the middle of my forehead started to tingle. 

After I finished meditation, everything seemed to appear brighter color wise. The tingling sensation is still active currently, but the most different thing I noticed is that everything (even morning coffee) began to taste very different almost a little more pure (I felt like I could taste each individual coffee bean). Then, In the shower today I was able to just appreciate the sound of the water hitting my skin and didn’t even have a single thought enter my brain really.

"This is just something I noticed, and I am writing it here as much for myself to remember as for others if they have a similar experience.  I started a mindfulness based stress reduction course a few weeks ago.  I have meditated for years but had a hiccup in recent years(you can read my post history if you really want to know). Hoping the course would help me with some mild anxiety/depression and ptsd from trauma, it was recommended by my therapist. 

This week I noticed I was much more anxious than usual.  No real reason, maybe a few more triggers than usual at work and a stressful weekend preventing me from having much downtime.  I seemed pretty run down by Thursday and noticed my anxiety was gone and replaced with a pretty strong feeling of not wanting to do anything.  Work or play.  

Seems like I can get stuck in fight or flight mode, like my sympathetic nervous system won’t shutdown when I don’t get a break somewhere.  The funny thing is I always hated the depressed feeling but it actually served a purpose.  I went to sleep earlier, I didn’t fight the feeling, so I got a few extra hours since my wife was out of town.  Seems like it resolved itself.  I try so hard to want to do something when I feel depressed.  It never occurred to me it is a natural defense to get me to do some non doing.  Force me to get back into neutral when I have been going to hard for a few days.  

Dont get me wrong, I was still watching a lot of negative cognitive distortions and working techniques I had learned in the course to reduce stress.  Doesn’t mean I think leaving someone alone and depressed is safe or a good idea.  But from a place of non judging and openness, it seemed to help.

"When living and working in four countries, I realized, that everywhere people create their own unique “I” and “me” about who they think they are. What differs is how they express it. But no matter how it always creates problems.

In Germany, people tend to be self-centered and create problems where there are none. In Japan, self-expression is very low, which suppresses the sharing of feelings and leads to frustrations. On the contrary, in the US where self-expression is very high, I often sensed that people are playing a role, leading to superficial relationships. In Mexico, the group is valued higher than the individual. I noticed that people were pleasing each other's egos instead of speaking the (unpleasant) truth, which can take a relationship to a deeper and more fulfilling level.

These observations are of course always only parts of the truth. 

Here are my learnings to overcome the ego.

"Hi, got back into meditation again recently (a week ago) and this time thinking of making it a habit and eventually a lifestyle.   


I dont know much about meditation (what different ways to do it) so for now I am just focusing on breath, which I kinda struggle to focus on anyway and it doesn't make me feel as peace as the next thing I do.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes me feel as peace (or feel good) is when I just let my thoughts wonder, and let them wonder and eventually the thought kinda shut down and I am focusing on nothing (idk, like im just there, or maybe im focusing on my head, its weird to explain) and then I start to see weak patterns (im not a visual thinker at all, for the longest time I have aphantasia), and i feel like im very light headed, and I feel like I am going deeper and deeper into state, and then (the limit of my meditation as of now) I start visualisation (again very weak) which gets me anxious or takes me by surprise and my heart starts racing and I get out of that deep state. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have very weak visualisation skills (I use to think I have aphantasia), and I was thinking that maybe my weak visualisation skills is due to trauma from childhood, or just genetics, or combination. And I had fear of being schizophrenia due to bad weed experience, and so now when I start experiencing visualization, my heart start racing a lot and I start getting anxious and it brings me out of that flow state (i have to say the visualization part happens normally when I am trying to meditate to sleep, but has maybe happened once recently).

"Hey! I'm a college student from Mumbai, India and I'm doing research on how mindfulness meditation can help manage stress after regular practice. Since I do not know many people who meditate regularly I thought this subreddit would be the best place to ask for help. The rationale for this research is to evaluate whether mindfulness meditation helps manage perceived stress in individuals and if it does then to promote the practice to people who are struggling with stress. 

From my own personal experience, mindfulness meditation has helped me change the way I perceive stress and my own personal identity and I hope to help other people who are in need to change how they perceive stress.

Research question - A comparative study of young and middle-aged adults on how they perceive stress before and after mindfulness meditation. 

The first part of the questionnaire is the perceived stress scale by Sheldon Cohen, which you will have to answer twice, the first time in retrospect of the time before you used to meditate and how you perceived stress back then and then the second time by answering how you perceive stress now after regular practice of mindfulness meditation. 

The second part of the questionnaire is about your practice of mindfulness meditation.

If you guys respond and I can do my research then I will post my findings along with my research paper soon so that the people who take part in the research can read what they helped create.

You can ask any questions related to my research in the comments and if you want I can also share a note which explains how I plan to carry out my research. Thank you!

"About a year ago I began an experiment with my yoga nidra practice. Instead of following a traditional guided meditation, I threw on Pink Floyd's Dark of the Moon. I repeated my sankalpa three times during the opening drum beat and laid perfectly still for the album's duration, mediating on the music, and repeated my sankalpa again at the end. When I opened my eyes 42 minutes and 32 seconds later, my vision was vibrating and my body radiated that familiar nidra glow. Since then I've meditated to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Derek and the Dominos, harder albums by The Stooges and Hüsker Dü, and symphonies by Beethoven, Mozart, Philip Glass and others. I prefer full-length records, ideally concept albums -- Sgt. Pepper in particular is a blast. Pink Floyd is my go-to -- their space rock is perfect for the practice. 

I'm not sure if it provides the same alleged benefits of traditional yoga nidra, such as the supposed 15 minutes equivalent to an hour of sleep. I've discussed the matter with mediation teachers, who voiced thorough skepticism about the relaxation available from a rockin beat and screaming guitars. But I find it awesome. 

Thoughts? Has anybody else tried this?",0

I would like to know if temples or meditation center take people whilling to devote their time for it! I live in germany and I have never went that far so I would really like some guidance!
Thank you :)",0
"Hello friend, I’ve been postponing teaching myself how to meditate and incorporating it into my life for quite some time, and I believe it’s time for me to start. I’m an avid reader and think that finding myself a book for guidance would be very beneficial, but the search is overwhelming. So I was hoping you could recommend some please. 

As I mentioned I’ve got no previous experience meditating so any pointers, tips, mistakes to avoid would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this.",0
"Or does that defeat the purpose, by trying to engage in another relaxing action vs. just sitting there?",0
"  

Several years ago I had established a consistent daily practice for 8 months based on Mindfulness in Plain English. Sit, watch the breath, bring my attention back when it wanders. 

Fast forward to a few months ago and I wanted to get back into practice and Sam Harris' style of teaching and meditation knowledge really resonated with me. I have been struggling to really connect with his practice and it approaches it from a perspective that I feel like I'm ""not getting"" or ""doing right"". Sit, try to locate the center or the thing called I, and turn attention on itself. He cuts right to the point of showing you how to see the self as illusion but I feel like I'm not doing it correctly. I really love the method he teaches but I'm just conflicted now. 

I want to just go back to Minduflness in plain english where I feel like I am doing it right but then I feel guilty and a bit stupid for ""giving up"" on what Sam is teaching.

I'm not sure what to do in this situation. ",0
"this last year my whole life has felt fairly boring. It started when i got depressed at the start of last college year, which i was able to deal with using meditation. 
However, i think this has definitely had a negative effect on me overall. 
I went from being a big part of a large group of friends, who i was very close with, to only being close with one person in the group and losing all ability to connect with my other friends in the group. I feel as if i have lost my witty, excitable side that i would show when around these people.
I know people say that meditation can cause a person to change, however it feels as if it has created a sense of calm in my self where i am no longer feeling emotions good or bad as much as i used to.
I was using visualisation techniques designed to ‘let go of stress’ which did create a sense of calm in me but at the cost of feeling other emotions, good or bad. 
I have been doing living kindness meditation and mindfulness recently which is helping me to realise emotions when they appear more and is creating more positive emotions in me, but it often feels theres something blocking me fully feeling certain things, such as joy and happiness which i do often feel but never in a way that makes me want to connect with others and have a laugh with them like i used to. 
Is this because i repressed my depressed and anxious feelings last year to cope with depression, which is stopping me fully feeling a whole range of emotions ? 
Things have been getting better recently now that i’m becoming more aware of how i’m feeling, but i feel there are many places where i’m being held back by not feeling certain things, e.g when socialising which has caused me to drift from many very good friends this year.
anyone have any advice on how to fully feel things again ?",0
"I did a short 5-minute meditation before heading out to work (I was already in my work clothes lol).

Honestly, I think it kinda helped.

I'm usually really anxious at work, but today it wasn't quite as bad. I still got anxious at times but I handled it a lot better.

Thanks for the idea, guys. 💖",0
"I've been meditating almost daily for a couple of year now. I sold, obviously. Have been relying on Headspace for quite some time, as well as some other non-guided apps and several books. 

I'm finding myself in a place where I've got an opportunity to do whatever I can I life. By that I mean that I'm at a corner in life, where I can choose a brand new path for me and for the world. My life until then felt it was on autopilot, and I feel the need to find a profound reason to act.

What type of meditation exercises could I do the help these interrogations? Headspace has one (in the Appreciation pack) taht makes you ask yourself questions, but I'm unsure of how I could phrase those questions. Any ideas, either of questions or exercises?

Thanks!",0

"Hi,

Sorry if this question was asked before.

I have been doing meditation for the past two weeks. I would say very stable, has an ability to manage the stress. I do meditation to get rid of headache (as I stare at my laptop all the day).

I would like to get this broader/deeper perspective on the life, improve my cognitive skills. I don't know the mediation techniques to attain all the things mentioned above (or at least somewhat closer to that).

Could someone please help me in learning the techniques and good resources like videos, articles are welcome.

"Specifically, this one https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4EaMJOo1jks&amp;t=2s

I've been a smoker, a pack a day, for 20 years.  But after I closed my eyes and listened to this, it was like turning off a switch.  It's crazy.  I still get urges to smoke but I feel like I am in control of them now, instead of the other way around - I simply ignore them.  I haven't smoked in 8 days.  Has anybody else quit smoking with meditation?",0
"Probably a year back I stopped a consistent half year meditation streak. I can remember how amazing it felt to carry that sense of calmness, stillness and the wider view on thing with me. As of now, I really want to get back into this consistent practice, but it feels to hard. I know that if I continue, I'll get back to that state where it feels like total bliss, but for now it feels to much of a chore or a full 20 minutes of wandering in distractions.

Exams will start for me now, which means I have full days of studying at home. I'll start every morning and afternoon session of studying with 15 minutes of meditation and in between pomodoro's of 25 minutes, I'll do 10 minutes of meditation. This should give me a head start.

I know I should not resist practice or difficulties within the practice and that this is a great opportunity for growth, but I just wanted to get this off my shoulders an perhaps people can share their insights with each other about this initial bump on the road.

There are flowers on the other side of the hill and it will take Right Practice and Right Diligence to get over the top. Though it's not a big top, one can not see what's on the other side, on needs to have faith to get there.",0
"I guess it was just wild to me idk but I never experienced it before. I kinda forgot about my whole body beneath me and all that existed was my mind and I was in a place where I was completely not judging my thoughts (something I struggle with during meditation and daily life). I almost started to panic a little because it felt like leaving the real world behind, but I just reminded myself that I could open my eyes at anytime. But by far the most interesting part was that behind my eyelids, it was like I was watching a movie. Different colored streaks and shapes of light (idk why but the outline of a baby kept showing up). And lastly, this blue ball of glowing light kept showing up, rushing into my field of vision, staying for just a moment, and then dissipating about 5-10 times over again until the bell was rung to end the meditation. I’ve gotten to places of extreme relaxation with meditation before but never like this and I guess I don’t know what it means. I’ve meditated off and on for a few years now, but recently I’ve been on a 30 days of meditation challenge so I’m hoping for more interesting experiences.",0

I meditated for 10 minutes every morning for a year straight. I focused on my breath. Im not sure if I saw a big change but I did feel calmer and didn’t drink alcohol.

"My partner and I have always wanted to go to a retreat but neither of us have been able to find/afford to go to one so I’ve decided to make my home a meditation retreat for the weekend. Having never been to one I know only what I’ve been able to read online so my plan is to agree between us to be silent for the weekend, we will have some simple meals prepped to be able to be made easily and quickly and at designated times. My biggest struggle in planning this is what physically do we do for the day. There are quite a few hours and I don’t know how to divide them into what kind of mindful activities/meditations. 

Could any of you help me plan this to be as realistic/successful as possible? Any advice is much appreciated",0
"can you people just breathe and chill out? why so many questions? meditation is just getting in touch with yourself, so do whatever helps. music, art, exercise, sitting and breathing... why do you over complicate everything?",0
"I use to strive for happiness all the time but when you're needy about something it usually won't come until you don't want it anymore.  That's just the paradoxical nature of the universe, like when you get in a relationship and now people want to be interested in you for some reason.   Lots of people including me  get disappointed in yourself for not being happy, which is counter productive.  To make a lot more progress in your ability to concentrate, your meditation practice, and over all well-being, a much better goal to strive towards is to be aware all the time.  Being aware and staying in the moment go hand in hand.  The body's natural state is feeling good so we get in our ways most of the time. By staying aware you'll be calm and focused and in the parasympathetic state which will lead to you feeling good, no forcing it needed :)

**Tips for staying aware:**

\-Where ever you are is the most important thing in your life. We tend to be goal oriented and lose focus on the journey.  Stay aware of the path you take to get to your goal.

\-Stay aware of your feet, your feet are a great anchor to the present because it grounds you and there's always sensations there to focus on

\-Learn how to breath properly. Watching the breath is great for your health and focus. Try to breath as quietly, deeply and slowly as you can. The less you breath the better and more open your blood vessels will be so **don't over breath.**  (Unless you're exercising of course)  Over breathing/hard breathing leads to constricted blood vessels and anxiety.

\-Observe the hypnotizing nature of thoughts. When a thought pops up try and stay aware, even if you can't and you get pulled away just notice what happened and come back to the moment. Notice how your attention was snatched from you and learn from it. This will really help you get to know yourself also.

\-**Don't judge the moment,** this is what I struggle with the most, but if you can stay aware of the moment non judgmentally and observe your ego labeling things as boring or exciting you'll make great progress in loosening the ego's grip.

\-Your ego's not a bad thing as long as you're using it and it's not using you.

\-Notice all things you're aware of right now. You're awareness is the space that holds all of your senses/thoughts/feelings try and be grounded in this space.

\-Notice when you go unconscious, did you grab that glass of water with out thinking? Did you drive to work on autopilot? Did you actually say those words or did they just spill out of your mouth with no awareness?  Notice when you go unconscious and try to bring consciousness to everything you do.",0
"Pain is inevitable. Suffering is an optional extra that we experience when we cling to things and try to deny the notion that nothing is permanent.

You don't have to suffer if you can learn to properly live in the moment, and feel everything you need to feel as it comes. Don't push negative things away. Don't try to hold onto anything positive for dear life as if you depend on it. You can't control anything. Just don't resist. let it all unfold before you.

It's quite simple, really. But that doesn't mean it's easy!

Remember that through meditation, you're not trying to get yourself to permanently be in a happy and euphoric mindset or whatever. Remove the notions that it's ""bad"" to feel depressed or any other emotions we call negative. They are just as important as positive ones. Don't be upset just because you're still miserable after meditating a whole bunch. That's missing the point. It's more about becoming comfortable with your misery. Befriend your misery. Go deeper into it.",0

"Hi, I'm new here. I've recently shifted gears with my meditation practice and have become a bit of an enthusiast about buddhist psychology and philosophy in general.

I would like to do a retreat some day but I'm a little bit reluctant. Long story short, I have pretty unstable sense of self, possibly even a full-blown personality disorder, although I've never been diagnosed. I have a lot of Narcissistic and Borderline traits, more than I would like, but I've done a LOT of work and therapy and I've reached a point where I can say I have more emotional intelligence and self-awareness than half the people I meet. It's been a long road, and I haven't found what I'm looking for. Enter: meditation.

The Insight practice + Metta I have been doing has given me some surprisingly good results and I feel I've found something really worth perusing here. I'm understating it actually, I'm actually really excited about it. The more I read about it the more I want to know. The spiritual aspect of it, the opening of the heart, the increase of compassion for your fellow human-being, and of course 'the end of suffering' through enlightenment (but let's not get carried away, I don't expect to become enlightened any time soon, just a taste would be nice).

But something I read recently scared me: 'One has to be somebody before becoming nobody"". Which I interpret as 'You have have a self in order to attain 'non-self'. Makes a lot of sense doesn't it? 

Does anyone have some thoughts on this? Or even better: do people with a similar condition have some experience and advise to share with me? Success stories or work-arounds are particularly welcome :) I would really, really like to carry on doing this (at a slow and steady pace).

Thanks a lot. Loving-kindness to you all :-)",0

"Are there specific mantras that are suppose to be used, or do you make up your own?",0
"Two years ago I [25/M] had severe crippling anxiety, anxiety attacks almost every day and couldn’t last a day without feeling or thinking about my anxiety. I started meditating a few months ago, nothing serious or consistent. But it helped along with working out, losing weight and seeing a therapist about my OCD thoughts and fear of having suicidal thoughts which were caused by my OCD and anxiety which was just a loop. 

Present moment, I have been following a strict workout program which I created since I have been working out for years before my anxiety. I’m currently on week 3 and have followed it to the dot, 6 days a week. I have been meditating every single day but not at a specific time and not a specific form. I have been on Insight Timer listening to a few guided meditations here and there and it’s been 11 consecutive days. I have listened to love and kindness meditation and teared up almost every time. I have been reading two self-help books here and there – Make Peace With Your Mind &amp; Can’t Hurt Me. My sleep schedule is still a mess because I’m trying to balance my last year of university and running a family owned restaurant with my dad so I’m trying my best.

Meditation has definitely helped me, but it’s also kind of overwhelming me in a sense. I’ve meditated some days where I completely lose track of time and 20 mins turns into 5 mins because I’m paying attention to my mind. I’ve done yoga nidra where I got completely lost into the sensation of every tissue. Some days my meditations aren’t working out, I’m either too sleepy to stay present or my back is sore from working out. 

I’m always trying to find the “best” guided meditation to “fix” me, but in hindsight I already know that I’m fixed. I saw my therapist last Monday and she couldn’t believe the steps I have taken on my own to become better. I’m overthinking whether “meditating” is actually working and if I’ll ever be “better”. But I already know that I’m better. When I’m able to stay present I feel peace and calmness. When I allow my mind to think it’s wondering why am I like this, is something even wrong with me, why can’t I just be me. But I then realize that my past is what made me, it is the reason why I’m like this. I didn’t have the greatest childhood – mentally. Lots of dysfunctional problems within my household which I tried to ignore by being a kid and just going out and being active but I was aware of it. Then I turned into a shut in, I spent maybe over 10+ years on the internet, avoiding actual responsibilities as school and sleeping. I did exercises and play sports but my mind was always excited to go home. But I know that I’m capable of great things when my mind is set. My entire highschool year I was getting 60s until I got to my last year and said enough is enough. Changed myself completely, mentally and physically I was at my best. Got accepted into university and from there it all fell off again and that’s how I’m here. 

I’m aware that I can do what I put my mind to. But I’m too stuck in my comfort zone. I don’t suffer from social anxiety anymore, I do have generalized anxiety but I push through it no matter what physically or chemical sensations I feel throughout my body. I’m aware it’s just anxiety. 

But now I’m confused about life. I’m not hopeless or anything. I’m actually hopeful and want to do great things. I need to work on the following things to truly feel great because they’re haunting me:

• How do I overcome my fears. 

• How do I stop feeling anxious because I’m worrying about fear. 

• How do I stop looking for my purpose in life or thinking about it constantly when I already know what I want – a great physique for my health, a well paying job so I never have to feel like I’m less, a loving family with my girlfriend.

• How do I let go of all the years I have been avoiding my anxiety and well-being and the two years where my anxiety was destroying my life

• How do I stop overthinking everything and being scared I’ll never get better 

• How do I stay present all the time and control my emotional reaction to avoid the anxious loop of OCD thoughts 

I’m fully aware that anxiety is built in us to survive as humans and that everyone has anxiety. But it’s the emotional reaction to those thoughts that can make or break you. I know that change is possible due to neuroscience and meditation studies showing that we aren’t a “fixed” mind we are a programmed mind – which is capable of being modified (change in our wifed mind). 

*Are these thoughts normal when starting to focus seriously on meditation?* I have started 30 day journey to rebirth by on Insight Timer so hopefully that will help. I’m gonna continue to work on myself through journaling, exercising, gonna start running and sleeping before midnight as well.

"I find it almost impossible to simultaneously focus on my breath without trying to control it. This creates frustration and takes me away from the practice as I'm thinking about trying to let myself breath naturally.

"So I had been hearing about all the benefits of meditation and provided I've just started my anxiety and depression meds and I'm seeing a therapist, I thought this was the best moment to try it.

I sat cross legged on the floor, set a timer to 10 minutes and played some random relaxing music video on YouTube. I closed my eyes and tried to focus on my breathing, in and out. I could feel my mind drifting away quite a lot of times, but I tried to reconduct it to the breathing without feeling frustrated about it. My meds make me quite groggy, I'll admit, and at least in one occasion, my head has fallen back, as if I were to fall asleep, but I didn't. I have heard the music and the noises around me beyond the headphones the whole time.
When the timer went off I was quite surprised because it felt like time had flown by. I thought the general sensation was the opposite! In the end, I was feeling relaxed and still groggy, I would've put myself into bed immediately, but it was the early morning.

Have I done this okay, or have I just been in a asleep/awake state for the whole time?",0

Can meditation make it easier to start studying if I do it right before I start my study sessions? Or does it only help fix the problem of ""being in default mode"" and the problem of ""being passive and reacting to things""? Do I only need to meditate in mornings/night/the day when I study, or does meditating right before studying and during study breaks help more?",0
"I’m sorry, but I scrolled through this sub and it’s really, really strange.

I know nothing about meditation. I mean, I’ve sat and focused on my breathing and tried to focus on my body and what it’s saying. I never feel like I’ve been good at that even. I don’t like sitting still for long periods of time.

So... how do I do it? Why is it important? I know there are scientific evidences and studies showing this is beneficial, but how has it helped you?",0

"Hello guys,

recently I have been doing a new form of meditation that involves pronic breathing and a ""subconscious mind"" technique that I wanted to share. First, let me explain pronic breathing.

* Breathe in for 6 counts
* wait 3 counts
* Breathe out for 6 counts making an ""sssssssss"" sound
* wait 3 counts
* Breathe normally 2 times
* Repeat

Let me explain the process.

1. First, do normal get in state by meditating normally by bringing awareness to your breath &amp; body for a few minutes.
2. Second, bring your awareness to the back end of your spine and do 3 cycles of pronic breathing to establish a deep connection with your body and get out of your head.
3. Third, imagine roots coming out the soles of your feet, deep into the ground. And do 3 cycles of pronic breathing. This time, visualize the air coming up from the roots into the back of your spine as you breathe in, and out of the roots as you breathe out. This will get you grounded and make you feel safe enough to access your subconscious better. It works cause your mind can't differentiate between imagination and reality at that moment.
4. This is the important part. Start noticing sensations in your chest and stomach area. That's where repressed emotions hide. You might feel a tightness or you might start shaking. Shaking is good as it releases tension. Breathe into those sensations. Think ""When was the last time I felt this sensation?"", ""When was the first time I felt this sensation?"". Get to the core. It won't be easy at first
5. After feeling the sensations for a bit, however much you like, do 3 cycles of pronic breathing again. Imagine the sensation coming up as you breathe in. As you breathe out imagine the sensation leaving your body.
6. Sit and feel the relief for a bit

&amp;#x200B;

Try it out for a while, it works really well! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't been meditating for a while at least, but it's definitely something to try if you've already been meditating for some time.

Cheers!",0
"thanks guys already for this great subreddit, I always find very inspiring posts here. Now I got an issue since about a month. 

I've been practicing meditation for around 1 year more or less consistently ca. 10 to 20 minutes each day, sometimes 50.  Sometimes guided, sometimes only with a timer. 

I noticed something weird. The longer I don't practice meditation the more I only think and 'obsess' about it.  I kind of slipped out of my routine during my travels and since I'm back I haven't been meditating. I  get all these thoughts about meditation and they revolve around 'hm meditation is so good for you' 'yees you really felt better and were able to go through emotions' 'so interesting that meditation does that to you etc.'. 

I wondered, is that my ego trying to keep me away from actually doing meditation? I noticed it in a different area. If I tell someone ""I'm gonna work on my essay today"" I'm less likely to work on it, because the positive response of saying it out loud means in my brain apparently that I already did it. Which is not true.

Am I procrastinating meditation? Anyone had that as well?",0

"So, there's this thing that happens with me, I'll get super stressed about something and on occasion I will reach the threshold of what my mind can handle and then a second later all the stress lets go and I feel calm, but then my mind goes a bit funny in the process. I think it's some sort of pre-psychosis thing. It usually heals within a day or two and then I'm fine, but I'm wondering if anybody has a similar experience and have you tried meditating and exploring the sensations of this particular state (the state being painlessness, aloofness, loss of function, occasional extreme frustration/anger) ?

I've started meditating regularly however, and I want to explore this with meditation but I am afraid that it might aggravate the symptoms, so I'm just wondering if anybody has tried this before and what were the results?

"When you can see that thought is only an expression of what is being experienced-you begin to see that thought is not the controller of impulses and movements in your body and brain. This suddenly transforms your whole experiencing structure. Now there is no escape from what is being experienced. Thought is not able to coin any relief, consolation as an escape from what is being experienced. You enter into a new dimension.

Pick a pen. A whole set of physiological and neurological movements are involved. Now the thinking – I have picked the pen – is expression through words.  
 Thinking arises to explain. This is the limit of thinking.  
 The actual movements – physiological and neurological happen.  
 Put your hand in cold water. There is feeling in the body and brain. Now thought can express this feeling, it is not this feeling.

 The implication of this is like this.  
 When the above fact is noticed, any expression like of sadness, confusion, stress, anger and so on – there is no one questioning the feeling of sadness, confusion and so on. Thought is unable to gloss over them. Energy remains concentrated.

‘I do not want to be angry’; ‘I want to be free from fear’; ‘I want to be happy’; and so on, the words create an alienation as if there is a separate entity to reject or retain.",0

"Hey fellow 'taters, I've immersed myself significantly the more rational, westernized side of meditation for quite some time now, with the likes of Kabat-Zinn, Sam Harris, and Shinzen Young.

I'm interested to delve more into the more mystical, esoteric side of meditation. Nothing too far gone or religious, but something that brushes with ideas like ""we are all one"", and ""we are the universe experiencing itself objectively"". Something in between arcane yogic texts and scientific mindfulness speak. I am a skeptic when it comes down to it, but I really do enjoy the food for thought. Shinzen Young touches on some ideas more like this in The Science of Enlightenment, and I want to explore further. Any recommendations? Preferably something I could find on audible.

"I have been meditating on and off for the last year and a half, however in the last two months I’ve been consistently doing it every day. With the breath, is there a particular way how to inhale and exhale the most effective?

" The only real intoxicant, which lasts for lifetimes, is bliss. Nothing is more wonderful than the cocktails your bio-chemical, bio-electric endorphins released by the pineal, pituitary and other glands you were born with. No fermented beverage can match the wonderful power of life than bliss. When you can consciously awaken bliss, what need is there for temporary intoxicants?

The source of these powerful endorphins is the electro-magnetic energy your body is coming into contact with through the subtle physical body, the subtle emotional body, the fiery mental body and higher consciousness. If these bliss is lacking, the gateways must be purified first, allowing for the path to bliss to increase. It's a result of purifying negative karma, misconduct, negative habits of mind, diet and other ways which are unwholesome, which need reorientation.

"Hello everyone!

I am interested in knowing about the following experience.

Last night meditating, at one point I felt how my body hairs bristled and were static, and at the same time I felt how my bed vibrated or felt that someone was hitting the bed mattress from below.

I was absolutely aware. When the first blow occurred, I opened my eyes because it was so brutal ... I closed my eyes again and the same.

I haven't found anything related even on the web.

I thought that it could be an astral projection but, I have already had projections and this has not happened, rather it is a much more brutal and constant vibration (astral projection)

So my main question is how can I do all of these if you do not think? Don’t you have to think to understand, learn, and gain something? I really want to learn about meditation, mindfulness, and enlightenment but do not know where to start.

"My lovely friends, I think it works. I am 23, most of my adult life I am very shallow emotionally. I dont have things like attachment to people, empathy, love, guilt, sensitivity and many other normal emotional feelings. I am dead emotionally, I can even watch executions without any sensitivity.

When I was meditating, I was imaging myself as a kid, and trying to remind what I was feeling. I was imaging my love to people, being very happy and attached to them. During the meditation, I felt like a kid once again, I felt love, attachment and every human emotion.

I felt like I wanted to hug someone, and take care of someone. I felt like a normal human being. I know what normal people can feel now. Feelings of love, emotional attachment and gratitude are very strong and positive, its amazing. I will try to try fill my emptiness with those feelings. I dont want to be dead emotionally.

Do you experience the same thing and how do you deal with it?",0
"As the title says; I've been meditation for almost 4 months. I decided to meditation for personal reasons.

At the start I meditated for 5 minutes, even less. Now I last between 25-30 minutes, sometimes I meditate twice a day, but most of the time I  do it just once. I think it's enough.

My method is quite simple for anyone interested:

- Half lotus (I put a pillow in my back because back issuess).
- I put my headphones and I play the Om mantra (Om mantra @ 432 hz for anyone interested).
- I just pay attention to the mantra. I bring my mind back to my meditation if its wandering.

I'm planing to try Sodarshan Chakra Kriya at some point.

Now here are some results I've had so far:

- As I said: I meditate more and more as time pass by. I feel that I could meditate for one hour in a few months (i do it everyday).

- Itching: I think this is a common issue for almost everyone. I've read threads on this sub asking for advice and how to get over it. This is what happened to me:

I had terrible itching (I still have), the itching in my ears were a pain in the ass to deal with, I had to stop my meditation because the itching was unbearable. Anyways, at some point I said 'fuck it, ill meditate for 5 mins if necessary. better than nothing.' I was frustrated and I thought I would never meditate more than 10 mins or so. 

However, out of the blue, a couple of months ago (maybe august?) I could tolerate the itch.  I can't explain, but now the itch doesn't bother me. At all. Even if it is intense. Probably my will became stronger?. I don't know, however this is a great progress. 

- I can focus more easily. I still have a very active mind, but because I choose to, but  now i can control it whenever I want.
 
I remember that my mind was a mess in the mornings, it wouldn't shut up, but now is quite different.

- This is where I need help and know why it happened:

Last sunday I started to meditate in the afternoon; at some point of my meditation I began to see images, not abstract images or random stuff but it was more like places I know in real life, i know they exist  because those images were from my city. Does it make sense?.

It just happened me once, but it was the weirdest experience i've had so far. I mean, I  sometimes I see some lights, but I never experienced something  like that. It happned me once, but never again. Has anyone else experienced something like that?.

Thanks for reading this and I hope it makes sense since english ain't my first language.

Edit: I forgot to mention something else, something very important: Since the moment I meditated for more than 15 mins my memory has increased significantly.",0
"I have been trying to control the ability to manifest for something but it does not work when I want it to work. I can only manifest something only when I am really nervous, panicking or in difficult situation. Like for example when I am really nervous because I have a problem then I use my inner brain to want something and the problem fixes, most of the times it's instantly. For example, the other day I was looking for something really important that I lost and needed, I could not find it so I gave up and I was really nervous and panicking then suddenly I would find it. One day a tree fell on my face, I was really panicking and my power to manifest was insanely strong. This happens like many times in many moments in my life, but since I started meditating I get a lot less nervous so I cannot use this ability as often.

How do I control this ability to manifest whenever I want and not only when  I am nervous, panicking or in difficult situation?",0
"When I was a kid, I would find myself while walking around,  and whenever I kind of ""felt"" like it, I could stare at an object and create this feeling of falling or butterflies in my stomach.  I would then tell myself in my head ""I can't believe I'm actually here"".   Like the world seemed so foreign to me and I genuinely thought it bizarre that I was there at the moment.  

Today, as a grown middle aged man, I can still do this, although it's doesn't come as easy and I don't get the bizarre feeling of being surprised I'm ""here"".  

I can recreate this falling feeling especially when meditating or if I'm just walking around and stare at something intently enough.  

I've never heard of anybody else being able to do this.  I never thought to ask either.  Anybody?

Side note, I was also a body rocker as a child.  I would just sit and rock back and forth watching TV or music, or just anything.",0
"I took all of your advice, and through the day I kept telling myself: you are more than your mind tells you. It gave me a sense of control over my negative emotions and anxiety.

"Since I’ve been making a concerted effort to meditate daily, my state of mind has improved greatly. One thing I have noticed in particular by becoming a gatekeeper to my thoughts is the amount of negativity that seems to demand my engagement. I am able to let go of the majority of it before it evokes an emotional response, but I would say 80% of my daily thought patterns are negative in nature. I’ve been through a bit the last year or so so I can see that it’s understandable, but has anyone else experienced this? And does it improve with more meditative practice?

 I wouldn't meditate the whole week straight obviously. I would have breaks to drink water or have light snacks, brush my teeth. When I really need a pause from meditating I would take paper and pencils with me to draw. I would also sleep but I would be away from all of the ""bad"" things.

"I've been meditating consistently once a day since 2012. The other night I was at a concert and my friend kept talking to me during a quiet song. A girl behind us rudely interrupted and said ""STOP TALKING"". Mind you, she was technically right--we shouldn't have been talking in that moment, but the way she did it was super abrasive and abrupt. 

What ensued was something I have not experienced before, and although it seems simple, it was actually pretty remarkable: I intuitively watched my emotional reaction to the occurrence. I observed the anger pulse through my chest and out to the rest of my body, and acknowledged that I was observing. I remained conscious, and didn't react to her in any way.

It might seem somewhat mundane, but these moments are crucial. It has always been an intellectual battle first and foremost to tell myself to be present. This came naturally and without much effort. The bottom line is it's easy to do your practice at home and get behind the routine, but it's in the ""real world"" where the practice becomes concrete. These are the little victories which signify that the practice is making you more conscious and aware.",0

"Hi, I have recently started meditation but know nothing about it. I have done some casual research as to how it works and most common practices and different types yogic breathing patterns. I feel meditation is now a clusterfuck of different methods in my head and I have no clear understanding(completion) of it. My process is simple 

1. I first try to hear out everything I can , expanding my range 
2. until finally I start drowning them all out, focusing just on my breathing 
3. I then begin to focus on the spot between my eyebrows without looking at that spot with my eyes (I read this somewhere and I have no idea why , I guess something to do with third eye)

I try to keep this up for as long as possible. I have not been perfect, I fail to be consistent , my mind might wander suddenly onto some thought but I am quickly back onto focusing on my breathing.  As I was doing this today, I had only felt like 7 mins had passed or maximum ten minutes no more , but when I opened my eyes it had been 40 minutes.

I would like to know from any of the internet experts over here if my processs is in anyway useful? or right?.

This time skip I have read about in advanced practitioners and I am sure I am not one , is it as a result of some mistake in my process.

"Ive had a weird experience plently of times most occuring when i meditate. I get an energy rush usually starting from my spine that engulfs my whole body like a wave of blissful subtle numbness.  Depending on how clear my mind is, it will either just go to my head and create this euphoric feeling (it makes my whole face feel a little tight), or if im really calm, it curcuits throughout my whole body, going down to my toes. If my mind stays empty, I can achieve multiple bursts of these euphoric pulses go through my body. The feeling is best represented by when you get goosebumps by something you like or enjoy. You get that chill feeling that rushes over you, but for me its always been a pleasent thing, where I feel my body through this wave. 

Ive gone deep enough one time were it felt like my body was vibrating because of the subtle pulses I was creating. 

The weird thing is that the best pulses are created by the absense of thought, but also the feeling of comfortability. Ive been through weeks or even a month were I had been stressed or too hard on myself, and its been harder to channel these euphoric waves.

Can someone help me understand this effect better,
Thank you.",0

"A semi-recent phenomenon I've been experiencing. During meditation, I can intensely focus on and subsequently ""feel"" certain sections of my head. Primarily, its either the very top of my head or the middle of my forehead, but I have had experiences feeling it on the sides of my head or sometimes more internally (not really identifiable anywhere on the outside of my head, I guess I'd say ""lower"" in my brain).

It's hard to describe what it feels like; the best I can give you is that it feels like an increase in pressure or heat in a localized area. I've found that in my deeper meditative states, I can ""drive"" the feeling to different sections of my head by focusing on the different locations.

Interestingly, I now feel it outside of meditation too. Reading a book or studying at work especially trigger it -- mainly high focus activities.

My  biggest obstacle to getting my life in order, down to basic hygiene:  Thoughts as well as (worse) emotions bubbling up. If I could anesthetize  them and be able to ignore my body, at least as a start, I'd probably  be getting out of the house much more regularly (for starters).

More  than anything is the craving for love and appreciation - obviously.  When I am reassured I have something to offer, I am calmer and able to  get my tasks done. I of course can't rely on other people like that,  especially since my obsession is the way I look.

I've  been recommended breathing meditation, and there have been times where  it has had a calming effect. Some other times it has had an irritating  effect.

I have heard there are  meditating techninques that have helped people deal with or reduce  physical pain without medication. I'd love to soak up in those.

I've read Tylenol is an antidote to the pain of social rejection (!) I have indulged in that when I wasn't in physical pain.

These are some observations I made last night during a session. Hopefully it can help someone else (as I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while and I've read some incredibly helpful posts) 

Lately, I've been quicker and more alert to mood swings. Last night some anxiety crept in related to a social event I had just come back from and I really wanted to study it before I moved on. I've started to think about the judgements I draw on people as reflections of my innermost fears or desires. What's more likely- that I absolutely 100% know the truth about something I'm witnessing, or that I'm drawing conclusions based on what I think or how I feel about the situation? 

The latter is obviously more likely. And if this is the case, it allows me to open up to new possibilities about how wrong I am in believing so many things. Particular with anxiety and depression. Why am I giving such authority to so many paranoid and unwelcome thought patterns? Why do I trust these responses so readily? And also, why do I keep damaging myself with negative and unwanted self-perceptions? 

I've found that a subjective reality like the one we live in is somewhat dependant on our perception of it. There is magic in this if we can learn to influence it in a positive way. Or in my case, at least start questioning it. The sheer fact that there are other ways of viewing things and my way is not the most credible in any sense is like a breath of fresh air. 

Like hey, I don't know. Maybe those people really like me and I'm the one with the self-image problem. Maybe I should work on that instead. ",0

"So i have been meditating a half hour a day for 6 months now. Today at school, someone took my seat during lunch. So when he went to get his lunch i took my seat back. He later came back and pushed me off leading me to fall in front of all of my friends. I was thinking of fighting him right then and there, but then i realized that it just was not worth it, and i just sat somewhere else. I guess im making progress ;)

Edit: Let me clarify something, when i first claimed the seat i put my bag on it,went and got lunch. But apparently this guy pushed my bag off knowing it was mine. So when i came back he was in the lunchline and I asked is anyone sitting here, my friends just said sit down. So then he came back and pushed me off",0
"Healing means to restore balance. Meditation is an expression of the need to heal, to find balance. This why prayer, meditation, self-reflection, service, charity and alignment with the Higher Purpose is so important. Karma doesn't happen to us as much as within us. Creating more constructive causes, yields more constructive effects in daily life.

In order to understand what true health is we must understand karmic tendencies in our own body, speech and mind. Each moment we're generating ripples in our own aura which extend out into the greater Universe, then come back with increased force depending upon the energy given to them. These reactions, or effects create all of our life, experiences and relations with others.

All health, ill-health, success, failures, gains and losses are a result of seeds planted by the energy waves. When our intentions are blended with the Universal Good, we gradually achieve a more harmonious relationship. We are all subject to the Great Law of Karma, which is nested within the Great Law of Compassion.

Any unwanted results are not a punishment as much as the balancing of forces leaving our heart mind, then returning.",0
"Hi,

Title says it all really.  I have been practicing somewhat consistently but feeling restless in my practice.  While I’m focusing on my breath, Im curious about the multitude of different techniques out there and thought I’d ask reddit.

This leads me to my question - do you use an app, music, binaural beats, the sound of silence?  Do you focus on your breath, light, loving kindness? 
Do you make it as part of your routine? Have you ever felt like not doing it? 

Would love to hear more, and thank you",0
"I did my first attempt with meditating on a person I have the strongest wish they'd be happy, get anything they want in this world, etc. 

I was going over several people in my head, and I noticed I have this feeling toward (if wish they'd be happy) almost everyone, but for some people it's especially strong. In my case it was my ex-gf (who's the kindest person I know), and my brother. It's SO hard for me to choose between the two, but if I had I'd prob go with my brother. How about you? which person do you have the strongest feeling of well-wishing toward? Is it your sibling? parent? partner? friend?",0
"Hi all. I've just recently started meditating again with a committment to making it a daily habit and a lifestyle choice. I decided it would be best for me to get started with audio courses, since I don't really know what I'm doing, and find the guidance helpful to getting started.

What I'm currently struggling with however, is that recently my anxiety has shifted focus from being one purely about myself and surrounding factors, to the far wider scope of our planet and potential collapse of our ecosystems. This shift has been healthy for me on a personal level, but the shift also comes with its own challenges. A lot of the meditations I have done so far have made points of ""understanding that things will get better"" and that ""whatever current negativity there is in your life will pass"" and the issue is that if my mind wanders to these dark places, hearing messages like this seem the opposite of what I currently feel to be the case. 

Given that I have also resolved myself to no longer turning a blind eye to these challenges of our time, it does make this start to meditation feel more challenging as I feel a need for action and urgency on the above issues. Do you have any recommendations for this? Do I need to change my perspective somehow? Should I be following a certain course or aiming for a different outcome with my meditation? I definitely still feel the benefit of the time taken to meditate, but I know how much better it has felt when my scope was so much narrower and my negative emotions were easier to discredit.

TL;DR : Meditations stating how ""everything will get better"" clash with my current fear of the state of the planet deteriorating and dulls the effectivity of my meditations. Please help!",0
"Hello I’ve been practicing meditation off and on for the past 3 years, I’m trying to start again after coming back from an off period.i find that im fixated on controlling my breath, it feels like I must be in control or I will suffocate.

"Small background of me. I've been meditating for 3 years now, very consistently since I was 17 years old. I have got hundreds of hours of meditation and went to some meditation courses including a Vipassana Retreat.

What I've seen is a major theme is that I'm constantly aware of all the pain in my body 24/7 and get discomfortable with it. In deep meditation, this fixation subsides for up to an hour or so. But in daily life, since the moment I wake up, I feel lots of discomfortable sensations in my entire torso, belly and chest.

This pain is causing me lots of suffering. Some days I rush to go home to meditate. My goal is to feel bliss and ecstasy on my body. How to deal with this pain? Should I do a month long meditation retreat to learn to accept the pain?

I'm starting to doubt my meditation practice. Thank you.",0

"Hi all,

I've made 2 videoguides for entering the Jhanas a while ago for my Sangha, which could be helpful for the fanatic yogi's among you.

The Jhanas are altered states of consciousness, each with their own very different characteristics and experience. They are accessible by anyone with a highly concentrated mind (daily meditation &gt;1 hr) and are very enjoyable, restful states. The Jhanas helped me a lot with progressing the spiritual path:)

"I've been practicing mindfulness meditation daily for about 3 months now, and I've found that whether I sit alone at home or I walk outside while doing the meditation, the results and benefits are largely the same.

I thought originally that sitting and ""doing as little as possible"" while watching my breath was best. **But whether I sit and stare at the wall, or walk along a path outside, my mind is still creating images.** If I sit alone, I just keep thinking. I can focus on my breath, but the thoughts continue on behind. If I'm walking, my thoughts are replaced instead by the images that change in my sight as I take my walk. And even as I focus on my breath, and basically think as little as possible, my body moves along automatically.

I thought this was interesting in part because it means you can meditate if you walk to work or take some form of non-driving transport (and so save some time in your day). It's also interesting that whether I think or not, my body will just keep doing what it needs to (so worry is truly pointless). I think this latter insight is one of the steps to a greater sense of peace in life.",0

"My big fear of meditation is I'll just end up making no progress in my life. I've seen many people who've meditated for a long time still have emotional outbursts, depression, and are very angry.

I know I ""shouldnt"" put a label on meditation on what it ""should"" or ""should not"" do, but I'm scared. Even my mindfulness teacher, who teaches people with OCD to be present, has depression at times. How can this be? I thought if you meditate enough, you'll have an inner peace hopefully long lasting.

For example, a guy who recently posted here talked about ""stealing back his chair"" and even got shoved out of it. I would've thought that after 6 months of meditation for 30 minutes for him would have had him not care so much that someone stole his chair. Maybe there is a subconscious reason as to why he got pushed out? I would imagine he would accept the situation and be ok with what is. Maybe even forgiving the fellow who stole his chair.

Another example is this girl who went on America's Got Talent claimed to have meditated for a long time. She then had a very big outburst and even crumpled up a piece of paper and threw it at the judges saying ""I'm not a number, I'm a person.""

So my concern is, why do these people still have these problems after meditating for long periods of time? I worry years after meditating I'll still have angry outbursts, still be depressed, still be unforgiving and hateful. I do not understand. Can someone please explain this to me? Thank you.",0
"Hello my lovely friends. I love the whole world. I have a question, when you meditate, do you have some sort of hypnagogia?

"Hard to describe but I’ll do my best. 

I’ve meditated a couple dozen times, but recently (maybe last 10 times) I’ve had a weird sensation after I open my eyes and last for about 5-10 minutes.

It feels like there a slight pressure or heaviness behind my forehead and upper brow.

Today I noticed that if I lengthen my breathe on inhales and exhales(even controlling sometimes)I can focus on it much better. When controlling it,  the controlling of my breathing goes away pretty quickly because I'm also trying not to control it I'm trying to focus solely on the sensation of my breath around or in my nostrils.(if that makes sense).

"Hey everyone. I am relatively new to mediation and have a question:

I practice for about thirty minutes at a time and focus on relaxing muscles and body awareness. A few times in my practice I have gotten to a place where I am separate from my body--as if I have detached and my soul/awareness can move around within my own skin/limbs. I'm a total novice, but if I had to label this, then I'd call it hypnosis/trance. And I definitely want to explore it more. How can I do this? Anyone have familiar experience or guidance on more easily getting to this place? I have been able to get here only a few times.

I do self-guided meditations. Spend about five min focusing on breath, the next five body, and the next twenty relaxing each individual muscle. I use the imagery of butter melting on a warm skillet.

Thanks a ton",0
"Since clearing my mind Ive realised quite a few things: The few friends I have at the moment are shit and only use me . The popular girls who giggle around me dont think im cute, they think im just a a nerdy anorexic kid.I am ugly as fuck (before meditation I thought I looked half decent). I feel lonelier than ever. I can also sense the joy in others but I can't sense any joy in myself. There is no one who is there for me. The rest of my family is not even realising whats happening to me and frankly they wont care if I told them.


Where did I go wrong?",0
"My mind used to be filled with a constant inner monologue of thoughts, including escapist daydreaming, worry, analysis and imagined conversations. Via drugs I discovered a state where my mind had much longer periods of quiet. Within these periods I felt the world around me in a much more profound way. I noticed a lot more of what's around me, and in association with perception there were more of countless nameless feelings which seem like essences of what I'm perceiving. I guess this could be called seeing more beauty in the world around me, even in what's objectively mundane, common, average or imperfect. It's a state where I can even see beauty in what might objectively be called flaws and imperfections. This state reminded me of early childhood, before a terrible back and forth move from Croatia to Canada which made my mother worse put me into the worse state with constant inner monologue. Over time I learned how to quiet my mind while at the same time intentionally redirecting my focus onto my perception of the external world. I could do this even without drugs. It seemed like this kind of transformation was the main benefit of meditation. 

One time I had a disturbing experience with meditation. After meditation I felt refreshed and energized, and with motivation to take my difficult and emotionally abusive mother for a drive. Talking to her, even just trying to decide where to go, threw away the good state and put me into a worse state than before I meditated. This led to a decrease in interest in meditation.

Now I think I understand what was wrong. I was manipulating my awareness into a greater focus on present moment perception while not allowing a deeper connection to my body and associated emotions relating to sense of self.

Emotions relating to sense of self always seemed to be a source of suffering. If I want something but can't have it, or I don't like the way something is, or I'm afraid about something, then I can suffer about it. It is nicer to not have those concerns. Part of what I did by training myself to focus more on perception of the present moment is blocking out those concerns. But I'm not sure that I was ever very in touch with my body and associated emotions relating to sense of self. Even long ago memories of my childhood in Croatia seem to involve some tension and disconnection relating to this.

This seems like the opposite of what Buddhism talks about. Refusing to follow my own desires can cause suffering. Those emotions relating to sense of self can include various desires which can improve my life if fulfilled, and ignoring them can lead to worse experiences. Or in other words, I don't want to just become more selfless and love other people more; I need to love myself more!

Can meditation be useful for this? Which particular types of meditation or guided meditations are useful?",0
"Recently I’ve heard a lot about Transcendental Meditation and I — for one weak moment — almost got sucked in.  

But honestly, it seems like a total cult. It has tons of celebrities and other people endorsing it like it’s some kind of Scientology thing. So I wanted to get to the root of what transcendental meditation was. That’s when I found mantra meditation. 

I tried an app called 1 giant mind, but it’s broken right now, so I’m kind of in this weird exploratory purgatory.

* 30 minutes- Breathing and meditation 
* 20 minutes- Group discussion. Q&amp;A

A virtual meditation session and activating chakras. Channelizing energy in your body to bring clarity to mind and energize your center.

"I know we can use mantras, physical objects, sound etc., but most big teachers that I know of (mingyur rinpoche, Suzuki roshe, chogyam trungpa, pema chodron, Andy puddicombe etc.) all point to focusing on the breath as the go to method so to speak. 

I just wonder why that is - is there something that is inherently ""better"" or easier about it? 

I've been meditating on the breath everyday for 5 years but have recently considered trying another technique since it, to me, isn't the most intuitive and straight forward thing to do (long explanation for another thread) 

Would love to hear if anyone has gone from focusing on breath to another object (not objectless meditation) and what their experience was. I'm considering mantra but don't really know",0

"Have you ever listened to someone and there voice has a calming or relaxing effect on you?  Voices have powerful effects, so just by the way you speak and the intention you have while speaking can effect people.

"I have been a meditating effectively regularly for about 3 years. Mainly doing breathing meditation. Although, I have experience with other techniques like vipassana.

I have noticed a gradual change in my thinking patterns where I become aware of thoughts and emotions faster.

"I didnt really know where else to share this so im putting it here. It happened a few years ago when I was still experimenting with meditation, just like any other one of my sessions. I dont really recall why or how it happened, but for maybe a few seconds or maybe even a minute, I experienced an intense pleasure that I cant describe. All I remeber is that it felt really good, not like temporary pleasure, but rather a deep fufilling sensation. 

I have never been able to replicate that sensation, probably because I was consciously trying to achive that state, but I really want to get back into it once I have more time. If anyone knows what that, ""state"" is, can you share more information on what it is and how it works. Im intrested to know more about it since I havent heard many people talk about it before.",0

"Recently, I started healing from trauma. 

I got to a safe place, where I don't have to deal with danger on a daily basis any more, but I still couldn't shake the intense fear, so yesterday I decided to meditate on death. It felt really liberating. I started to just picture the feeling I got in near death experiences and it really gave me perspective. (Mind you, not in a suicidal kind of way, I am quite keen on living). 

I started doing some research on it and there is a lot info out there.

I would like to hear your experience too? 

Does anybody practice it? 

What is your take on it?",0
"I'm using ""pull"" for lack of a better term here.

Since starting my inward journey, I always felt like I was pretty good about not being attached to anything. Of course, I never had any frame of reference for that feeling other than my past self.

However, during meditation today, I noticed inside myself that I had a slight ""pull"" towards the things I'm attached to. Imagine you're at work: during the day, you have this unconscious awareness of the general direction of your home, and this awareness of where your car is in the parking lot, all sort of unconsciously drawing your attention to them ever so slightly, even though you can't even see them. You probably also get the same effect when you put your phone down. That's the ""pull"" I'm talking about.

When I noticed this energy I was exerting towards the objects I was attached to, I made a conscious effort to sort of ""draw it back in,"" if you will. This allowed me to meditate with myself in such a way I had never experienced before.

Now, even afterwards, my draw towards other unhelpful things I used to really identify with (like drinking, watching TV, playing videogames) all have noticeably less control over me, and more meditation is honestly at the front of my mind now. I would highly suggest everyone try this out if they haven't yet. I can't promise it will have the same effect for you as it did for me, but I can promise that my effect was profound enough to warrant me sharing my first post on this sub! Good luck!",0

You can do the meditations on this site, even if it is not the exact time of  the meditation schedule. There are also many other different mass meditations on the home page of the website I linked.

The following link is a few free pages about how to do the merkaba meditation (recreating your human lightbody)- 




https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.interdimensionalhealinglight.com/merkabah-star-tetrahedron.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjU44iIzO7jAhUQFnwKHQtlAgYQFjAAegQIBRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0svLr62SVCYtSMhnd2-rC7



This meditation, if done while feeling love energy, will release negativity and blockages from your chakras and open them up, thus restoring proper energy flow in your body, and improving your health. It can also change your consciousness to a higher dimensional awareness of peace, love and harmony with all life everywhere.


I highly suggest giving this meditation a try. Here is a guided audio link on YT of the merkaba meditation:




https://youtu.be/81Kf3UBQ1g8




Its from the book ""the ancient secrets of the flower of life part 2"".  The book also teaches spiritual anatomy of your 13 chakras,  healing, psychic powers, how to cast out entities/demons from your energy field, how to reconnect to mother earth,  the cosmos and your higher self,  and talks about a few intergalactic conspiracies and the current great awakening!


Here is another very useful meditation called the unity breath. It goes hand in hand with merkaba meditation. It will allow you to tap into a stream of infinite healing love energy:

"Do you need supervised guidance to learn how to meditate? Or can you teach yourself from simple instructions from for example a video? I've been dabbling with meditation for some years, and am wondering if it is just one of those things you won't make proper progress without supervision of some sorts.

In particular, I'm reading about Acem meditation, a book called The Power of the Wandering Mind. Acem meditation is a type of mantra meditation which they call a non-directive technique. They seem to be holding some of the cards close, and I'm sceptical whether they are more interested in making money from their business, then they are about spending knowledge about meditation. The book is very interesting however.

Edit: Thanks for the responses. My conclusion is that while you can learn to meditate self-taught, you get farther with a teacher and a community. I also feel like no one has a patent on what is the key to correct meditation, so there is little reason to go to an expensive retreat to learn a specific technique. I think also if you don't always have a teacher or a community, talking to a friend who also meditates may be valuable.",0
Never felt more attracted to a religious book more than theirs. I made this meditation video/audio and laced some vedas being read by my girl through it. [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/et7VKpeETu8) please try meditating with this! The subject i chose is « ways to live to be “successful” » from a 🕉 standpoint. Enjoy😉,0
"I have found that my mind wanders less if I think about what’s going on in my body in between breaths. Kind of like a mini-body scan each time - where I can feel tension, the contact between my legs and the chair, etc.

Should I continue this? Or does it count as the mind wondering, and when it happens I should be trying to bring attention back to the breath?",0
"Hey all! 

Thanks for taking the time to check out my post. I really want to share two experiences I've had over the last few days :)

First  is- I've recently gotten my dedicated Puja table set up- it's nothing big or fancy- it's actually a very old vanity bench that used to be my grandmother's. I covered it with a pashmina and decorated it with a couple small candles, a little Ganesha lamp, some books (The Bhavagah-Gita, Be Here Now by Ram Dass, and Secret Heart- a collection of Rumi poems), other likenesses of enlightened beings. I love it. It's really nice to have that space just for me and just for Sadhana.  But I've noticed now when I come out of mediation my dog Roxie and my cat Luna are always with me. Roxie on my left, Luna on my right. I just think that is the sweetest, most beautiful thing ever. They have such sheet souls- and I never call them in there with me- I start my meditation practice alone and when I end and open my eyes, they are there. &lt;3 Anyone else have this experience?

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, last week I got really lucky and found a copy of The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying by Sogyal Rinpoche at a local used book store. I've been interested in reading this book for quite some time. On Thursday night when I started reading, as I carefully moved through the pages I felt my body expanding bigger and bigger...It was almos tlike I was tripping...I kept blinking and  looking at the words harder ad harder-knowing I was holding the book incapable of explainging the sensation with any logic.  It was magic. I felt as big as the trees in the front yard! 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks again for reading any comments or discussion welcomed.",0
"I feel I already basically know what the form of the answer is going to be to this question; ""...there are many differing schools of thought..."", ""...it's difficult to say..."", etc., but I was wondering if there was any general consensus on the reality of becoming truly enlightened, and if it's considered to be an objective and absolute state of mind inside/outside of Buddhism. Is it a ""0 or 1"" type thing or can somebody be only slightly enlightened? Is there a science to being sure of the claims made about any of this outside of experiencing it for oneself? I've had some experiences with psychedelics that have surely pushed the upper bounds of how in-the-moment and one-with-everything a person can be. Is there a good reason to believe that these experiences were very different from achieving this state of mind naturally? Thanks for any considerable thoughts.",0

"Read Part 1 here: [https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/d2sbwg/why_is_meditation_so_hard_because_of_the_monkey/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/d2sbwg/why_is_meditation_so_hard_because_of_the_monkey/)


My previous article, Why Meditation is so hard had one comment that resonated with a lot of people:



*we are stuck in the space between hell and heaven. The Light has come, so we can’t go back to the old ways. But the monkey is also still there, so we don’t feel peaceful either.*

*This is the worst state to be, because you feel you have lost the material world, but not yet gained the spiritual.*





## My Own Struggle



At one point, I loved video games. I could easily spend hours stuck in a game.



Then I grew bored of them-- I felt they were exactly like real life, exactly **like work**, in fact. You do a lot of pointless actions that lead to pointless results. Kill zombie, move to 2nd floor, kill bad guys, get key, rinse and repeat. I felt the games were like life-- a lot of routine and mechnical grinding work for no real benefit. Soon, I had dozens of games I had paid, but never finished.


I also was writing books, novels and trying to build a business, but all these things started feeling hollow to me. I was like, why am I doing  this? I had started all of it to make money, become famous, to Be The Man(TM), but it all felt fake and meaningless. 



## The Dissolution of the Ego, and it's Attempt to Recreate Itself



Meditation leads to a weakening (and eventual dissolution) of the ego-- and by ego I mean the attachment  to our routine thinking mind. The mind starts thinking it is the boss, and starts bullying the body and other thoughts around, which leads to most of our problems.



In my own example, I  used to think I was this *Stud Muffin Writer / Programmer / Soon to be Millionaire Businessman*(TM) . I couldn't sit quietly for 2 minutes- I always had to be doing something. And boy was my productivity high. I was writing novels, a popular blog, selling online courses. I could do anything...



... except sit quiet for 2  minutes. Anytime I tried to meditate, I would get angry. As in, mouth frothing mad dog angry. I tried to power through it, but now realise this is a horrible way. A better way (if meditation makes you angry) is to practice compassion and forgiveness, but that is another topic (let me know if you want me to write about it).



So recently, when I started losing my interest in all things I did, I felt I was going mad. As I told my wife, if I am not a writer / business guy, *what am I?* As Raman Maharishi said, something I felt was very stupid, **Who am I?** 



(I since found out from Adyashanti that a better meditation is **What am I?**)



And so I felt lost and hopeless. I had lost all my interests, but had not gained any spiritual benefits. I still felt f'in miserable. 



And this is a big problem-- meditation weakens the ego, it's hold on the body/mind, but the ego fights back. It has been the boss for so long, it ain't gonna give up just cause you chanted *Om shanti shanti* a few times.


And this is another problem many meditators face. Marketing tells them meditation should make them feel all *lubby dubby*, floating the in the air giving hugs to strangers. In practice, they feel shit. This is because there is a huge gap between marketing and the hard truth on the street. Meditation is a not a pill you can pop to cure your depression, no matter what all those best selling books say!

And so the ego tries to trick you:



* It makes you feel hopeless and lost

* You might feel you are going crazy

* You might feel everything is an illusion, that nothing matters anyway (*which if true, why do you feel so miserable? The ego has no answer, only doubts*)



Many people give up. I have given up too. Giving up is ok, because your inner self will not let you quit that easy; it will always bring you back, gently and slowly.


## The Battle Between Passions and Peace



And so we come back to our original problem. What do we do when we lose the material world, but haven't gained the spiritual world?



As I said, meditation, over time, leads to a weakening of the ego. The ego is our identification to the non-stop stream of thinking.

The problem is— the mind wants something to “identify” with, something external. So it will keep trying to create an identity for you, and feel depressed. The hopelessness and groundlessness you feel is **not you, it is the mind**. the mind feels out of control and helpless.

The mind **wants** something to grab on to, something to hold, something to give it stability. That is  why it is so scared all the time, because ultimately, there *is nothing to hold on to*. The ego, like I’ve written before, is like a soap bubble floating in the sun. It has no existence, it can pop anytime, and worst of all (from the ego’s viewpoint), **it knows this**.

And so the ego is scared all the time. It fights your meditation, it throws a tantrum anytime you make any progress, it makes you think you are crazy, or losing it, or wasting your time. 

And we haven’t even talked about passions.

### What Stars Wars taught me about meditation

*Go on, Luke, give in to your passions. Give in to the hate, and you will be with the Dark side* — a dude called Palpatine

For a long time, I couldn’t understand why the Emperor walked Luke to give in to his passions.

Nowadays, passion means good things. Silicon Valley wants you to be “passionate” about your job, by which they mean be willing to work overtime without extra pay. We are expected to “follow our passions”, and you are screwed if your passion is something that doesn’t make money, like collecting stamps or writing poetry. No, your passion has to be about something the market wants, like Jabbascript programming or accounting or family law. Yawn.

But passion originally meant suffering. Check the dictionary. The “Passion of the Christ” is not a story about how Jesus built a Web 2.0 blog using FaceTube.

Passions, if the you read the original Greek stoic texts, are run away emotions that take over us. They happen most commonly during meditation— if you have felt really angry or depressed or emotional during meditation, those are passions. We usually keep them suppressed by distracting ourselves, but they jump up and take over the mind anytime we are vulnerable, like hungry or tired, or when we try to sit quietly.

So the Emperor wasn’t asking Luke to work on his passion to build a Wordpress blog; he was telling him to let his wild emotions, raw anger and fear, take over, and let them rule his life.

We have all heard of examples of this.  Anytime you hear of someone killing another person in a road rage incident, they gave in to their passions. Their emotions went out of control and took over the mind. The rational mind became a passenger at this point. It could complain, but it wasn’t the one driving.

You have felt the passions too-- anytime you have screamed at a loved one, spouse, parents or children, and almost or completely destroyed your relationship. You may have later felt ashamed, feeling like you had been possessed by a demon.

And you were. This demon is the monkey, plus all the pent up rage and emotions you have been suppressing your whole life. At some point, all that shit just blows up.

And that is the 2nd reason meditation is so hard. We have been suppressing  our emotions, suppressing the monkey within us so long, he waits when we are weak and vulnerable and strikes back.

Like I said in the previous post, you have to make peace with the monkey, not fight him.

One way to control passions is to practice compassion and forgiveness. All real spiritual paths have compassion or service as a core tenet. Buddhists have metta, Hindus have kshama/seva, while Christianity was based on forgiveness (no comment on how well these religions do this in practice).

Compassion and forgiveness is what brings the monkey under control, because they are the things he cannot fake; the monkey (or ego) can pretend to be a great enlightened guru, he can give inspiring speeches, and be all spiritual; but he can never show compassion or forgiveness. And hence never feel peace.   

### Forgiveness is the Key to Fast Meditation

The mind is like a hot stove, red hot with heat. It burns you, causes you discomfort, but you can't turn off the heat.

Meditation is the key to cooling the mind- meditation is what turns the heat off.

Compassion/Forgiveness is like sprinkling cold water with your fingers on the stove. It speeds up the cooling process. You don't need compassion, but without it the journey will take a lot longer.

Which is why meditation can't be something you ""do"" for an hour each day, then go about your normal life. Meditation is something that must be done throughout the day (to the best of your ability, remembering that self shaming is a weapon of the ego, and self-compassion is the best form of compassion).

Once you stop putting in heat into the mind (in the form of angry / hateful thoughts), the mind will eventually cool down, giving you the peace you want. It just takes time.

"It has been often said, both in Vedic, Buddhist and other writings that if we want accomplishment, develop a dispassionate attitude towards results. This runs counter to our Western society which says, if you can't measure it, it doesn't exist.

The ancient wisdom found in the Vedas, Buddhism and long standing wisdom traditions is based in an understanding of faith in karmic methods in order to create an atmosphere in the mind where good will emerge more easily if the motivation for practice is purified. Hence, the need for increased communal awareness, Bodhicita and compassion. In a real sense, your practice is part of a reorientation for the welfare of not only yourself, but the space of the world around you.  What benefits you, will in turn benefit the community. There is an inherent interdependence between all of us, especially those working diligently to improve the quality of life for humanity as a whole.

At the outset of meditation practice, think of the welfare of yourself as linked to those you know, love and cherish. Then think of the larger spheres of friends, colleagues, neighbors, and continuing outward. 

Wishes for success in you practice.",0
"Don't even know where to start with this. I sat down and set insight timer to 35 minutes. Began with some focus on the breath and tried my best to center myself and distance myself from surface level thoughts.

Got that done pretty quickly so then I started to become aware of my emotional state a bit and just as I was about to do it - a wild boner appears. So I try my best to focus on that sensation but it becomes a struggle not to be distracted by overly sexual thoughts and/or desires. Eventually I recenter myself and the boner subsides. But then I get a few more boners one after the other. At this point I know how the whole cycle goes so I manage to be pretty aware of it all, just an observer.

Ok great, passed that ""level"". At this point I'm feeling pretty deep into the session and the ending bell already went off a bit before. but I decided to keep going. I start to notice this lingering tension around my right shoulder, probably a point in my upper trapezius actually. So I decide to put all my focus on that. Soon after I just feel this radiation of tension and pain through my entire upper trapezius, shoulder, neck. First the entire right side radiates and then I feel some of my left. I try my best to just observe. Moment after moment this radiation just becomes stronger and stronger. At this point I feel like my body is burning and there is nothing to be felt or observed except that immense tension and pain.

Can't explain this better than like this: I know that the pain is just in my upper body but it felt like it was all there is, that that pain IS my body and nothing else. This becomes more and more difficult to keep doing and I try my best to just let it all go but I just couldn't. So I keep observing it for as long as I could but eventually I just abruptly stopped my session.

I took my phone and checked insight timer: 55 minutes.  
When I stopped the session I was left with a feeling of huge soreness and pain and still that higher body temperature. It felt something like I overdid it in the gym and was incredibly sore from it + that somebody beat me up real good after that gym session.

So now after this I'm a bit more aware of all the tension and pain that I'm storing inside of myself. Not a pretty sight at all. I guess all I can do is keep going and eventually let it all go.

If anyone has any advice on how I could do this, it would be much appreciated. Thanks!",0

"*""The point of meditation is not to discover some cool techniques to occupy your leisure hours; it's to make the simple but momentous shift from doing to being. Don't make the mistake of turning your meditation practice into another urgent item on your list of things to do. Use it, instead, as a welcome oasis from doing, an opportunity to be, without strategy or agenda. In other words, keep it simple. Play with a few of the techniques at first to decide which one feels right for you; then stick with the one you've chosen. It really doesn't matter which method you use - they all end up depositing you in the here and now.""*

"So I posted previously, a couple of weeks ago I think that I has a feeling of tremendous joy envelop me while meditating.

I haven't tried to chase that, I don't meditate for that reason, but have only felt that again fleetingly.

Since yesterday or so, I've had a feeling following me around like I'm about to ""break through"" whatever on earth that means and the sensation of joy came again to me during my meditation session I just finished along with a feeling of heat and passed quite quickly.

To try and describe it, it's almost like something sat on the top of my head while meditating, and like something following me around constantly (sounds like I'm going mad, I know) and also like I could perceive it but not quite, if that makes sense.

I hope this makes sense to someone. I know this is because of my meditation practice and because of the sensation of joy that I get during meditation.

"For me, I recently found this guy, Francis Lucille, who explains things in an absolutely crystal clear manner, probably due to his past background as a scientist/mathematician. I find that a lot of teachers from religious/new age backgrounds tend to result in me getting more confused as I struggle to grasp their nomenclature, even though I am personally more inclined towards the woo-woo and the emotive rather than the rational. Atheistic teachers like Sam Harris also tend to leave me cold for some reason.

"I've been meditating daily since January this year, usually 4 times a day for 15 minutes. I used to have a lot of anxiety and negative thinking patterns but over time with meditation these have faded. I'm a lot more positive and optimistic and I don't really experience anxiety everyday like I used, however I still get some every now and again.

Since the end of April this year I would meditate and experience a kind of heightened awareness of everything around me that would last several hours. I would get better clarity of my vision and I felt more in the present moment than I ever have. Everytime I meditated I would usually feel these effects. 

This lasted till a few weeks ago and now when I mediate I still practice the same techniques however it feels like I don't get the same effects or I do they just feel a lot weaker.

Has anyone had this before where it seems like 
the effects of meditation is plateuing?

Edit: The techniques I use are I start by paying attention to the sound around me and just noticing all sound as noise not giving them any specific name just noise, I then do some breathing meditation followed by a body scan and some visualisation, I'll then do some breathing techniques where I'll inhale for 3 seconds, hold for 3 and exhale for 3 and continue doing this for a while.

But I finally did it. It's difficult to explain, but I let it go. I let him think whatever it is that he thinks of me. I accepted that our path was meant to end here. There is no need to fix it, no need to explain, no need to control it anymore. And this letting go has ""transferred"" itself into everything else as well. And one funny thing is that my rather chronic shoulder tension has been melting away. I'm able to simply sit back and observe and allow even if there is still lingering sadness.

That's exactly what happened to me about 4 years ago because I believed this myth too. A lot of people don't even start meditation because they feel THEIR mind has non-stop thoughts. 

I believe the goal of meditation, especially for a beginner, is to OBSERVE one's thoughts, not stop them. 

I made this short video to clarify this idea and offer some tips for beginners.

"I've been meditating for a few months now and have gotten up to doing 30-40 minute sessions. Usually just samatha alone, I have started to get down the breath concentration pretty well. But everytime I try to go into vipassana meditation from samatha I start getting distracted with my mind wandering much more than with samatha. Its frustrating. I do the noting technique when i do vipassana, noting my abdomen movements rising falling etc. Whenever my mind wanders I always note it and return to my abdomen when I realize I've drifted off. 

I'm wondering if I should continue doing this practice and it will get easier, or do I need to keep practicing samatha and eventually go back to vipassana. Am I doing something wrong? Or should I just keep at it and push through?",0
"Yesterday, my mother suggested I meditate and something in me really wanted to, so later in the evening I meditated after yoga for 9 minutes with a meditation playlist in the background. I was really surprised once I came out of my meditation. Inside I felt much more calm and during the meditation, I felt a vibration in my mouth that slowly grew on my chest and one portion of my face. Once I finished meditating, I let out a little cry that was satisfying and joyous. Along with that, for part of yesterday and today I’ve had more realizations and contentment about my life. Today, I meditated again and felt like I was in water. I had slight passing vibrations that weren’t as strong during my 12 minute session. I’m hoping to continue meditating every day now despite having school, but I’m really surprised my first time went well.",0

**FULL REVIEW** 

Video review: [https://www.facebook.com/liveanddare/videos/905385073160464/](https://www.facebook.com/liveanddare/videos/905385073160464/)

Links and research [here](https://liveanddare.com/mantra-meditation#Transcendental_Meditation).

&amp;#x200B;

**Overview / Summary**

I'm often asked if I recommend the TM technique/organization. I don't. And this video I discuss 5 reasons why not.  
(1) Identity Confusion — it's a spiritual approach to mantra meditation disguised as secular.

(2) Questionable Marketing — ex-TM teachers (and whistleblowers) have come out to say that the mantras are not unique to the individual. If that is the case, they shouldn't be advertized as if they were.

(3) The Effortlessness Myth — the core assumption of TM about meditation is flimsy at best.

(4) Cultish Background — More a problem in the past than right now, but worth being aware of. Warnings have been issued about the dangers of TM by the German government, the Vatican, the Cult Awareness Network, the Task Force on Missionaries and Cults

(5) Dubious Research — the papers that TM is based on to argue its ""superiority"" over styles of meditation are weak, and their conclusions are dubious.

(Note: all of this is just my own opinion, made based on many hours of research and talking with long-term TM practitioners.)

What do you think?",0
"I always found the idea of meditation to be sitting in quiet contemplation.

I was stupid wrong.

I’ve found through physical therapy that certain poses have certain spiritual energy surrounding them.

I honestly don’t know how to put it better but it’s something I can replicate and reproduce every time I get down on the floor now. It’s very weird.

If I hold these poses long enough I can feel the dissolving of my surroundings and my connection to my sensations

It’s like having both a physical and mental alignment in my imagination like a perfectly still unbroken surface of a lake.

It’s extremely visceral and gives me the shudders in an almost creepy way and I’ve lost time stuck in this moment of static energy.

Like balancing a pin perfect on its tip or walking an internal tightrope with your body.

It also has had massive implications in how interpret my own thinking and impulses, realising now they are truly optional",0
"When I meditate before bed I often feel a surge of serious restlessness and the need to move. I try to fight through it but I feel so uncomfortable to the point that after a minute of two I have to stop meditating. However, when I meditate 15 mins after I wake up it’s relaxing and I often try to stop my self from falling asleep. Not sure if it’s relevant but I have adhd which could be a factor in this happening. Also for contest I’ve been meditating 10-30 mins for 6 months consistently",0
"Recently meditation has been more than amazing for me (specially because I switch from doing so only at night and doing it in the morning as well) but I get a little stressed sometimes if I meditate less than an hour, thinking what my day will be without the ""right amount of time"".",0
"I've found lately that my favorite form of meditation is going for a walk without my cell phone. My imagination comes to me instantly as I wander through my subdivision, staring up at the pale blue sky. I love to cloud watch as I walk. I feel my mind instantly wanting to soar through the clouds like an airplane. Especially when you can see the shape of the moon peeking through the clouds in the evening sky. I imagine myself to feel weightless, although I am walking and my feet remain on the Earth. I take a deep breath and all of me is drifting away.",0
" 

I have found that those with **energy imbalance/grounding issues** look for guidance everywhere. They search all over the internet - read many articles, blogs, forums ; meet many doctors and therapists ; spends a lot of time, money and energy, yet they did not find something substantial that could give them the confidence that the problem could be solved in short span of time.

Many lose hope. Many lose the most important years of their life; some lose their jobs, relationships,etc.

For whatever this may have happened, I would always suggest someone to **learn from authentic teachers/organisation** who have years of specialisation  in this area.

I have done a lot of research on this topic.

A **Multi-prong approach** is needed to deal with this issue-

1. **GROUNDING EXERCISES-**

After unprepared awakening, energy gets stuck especially in throat, back of head, sinuses, shoulders,etc.

I am of the opinion that if we can **clear air passage ways with certain exercises** (TMJ, Neck, Sinus release exercises) , then its going to make huge difference in the way one feels.

All this exercises are aimed to - **clear Nasal pathway for air** and later **direct flow of breath along central channel of energy** **(Sushumna nadi)**.

We want **more and more air to flow through nose**, so that intensity of ""**fight and flight**"" mode can be reduced drastically. We are trying to hit from different angle to clear nose while doing the TMJ, neck, sinus release exercises.

I believe that many of the important psychic channels are in nose. So **clearing nasal passage** is of immense importance in dealing with energy imbalance issue.

Here are exercises you can consider doing-

* **ZHANG ZHUANG QIGONG STANDING MEDITATION**
* **DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING**
* **SINUS, NECK, TMJ EXERCISES**
* **STANDING MEDITATION- THE MASTER EXERCISE FOR ALL ENERGY IMBALANCE ISSUES**

&amp;#x200B;

2. **UNVEILING KNOT/GRANTHI IN NAVEL REGION-**

Brahma Granthi creates restlessness and inability to meditate. To unveil it one has to rise above thoughts, emotions and ego associated with lower 3 chakras with awareness and faith. Knowledge and awareness is the key. I'll give suggested book list.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Brahma Granthi is the first major block that sadhaka need to transcend. This granthi keeps a person under the illusion of the material benefits, physical pleasures, lethargy, ignorance and uncertainty.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Among all the most powerful is an illusion of physical pleasure. This granthi plays an important role, because it is responsible for the material man's thinking. It creates a kind of attraction in the nature of the human mind.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Illusions that are created by Brahma Granthi, may be represented as:  
• Permanent sexual thoughts and sexual activity  
• Permanent hunger, which is difficult to satisfy  
• Need of money, land and other tangible things  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The opening of this knot may also be due to some problems for the sadhaka, because it causes a strong increase of fever, a very strong desire of sexual satisfaction and a strong motivation for the material desires.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The work of this granthi associated with three major chakras - Muladhara chakra, Svadhishthana chakra and Manipur chakra.

&amp;#x200B;

One has to become **hollow and empty** from within. **Freeing subconscious and unconscious mind of suppressed/unconscious emotions and ego with knowledge and awareness is the key to unveil this knot.** One should be able to identify and differentiate between emotion/set of emotions/different flavours of ego when they arise in nervous system.

&amp;#x200B;

* **CRANIAL OSTEOPATHY/ CRANIOSACRAL THERAPY**

&amp;#x200B;

* **BACH FLOWER REMEDY**

It helps to **dissolve negative emotions** in the system like fear, uncertainty, over sensitivity, lack of interest, etc and **helps the body heal itself**.

When you forcefully awaken the energy, it tries to get rid of all the negativity or suppressed emotions from system and the Bach flower Remedy speeds up this process.

I highly recommend BACH FLOWER REMEDY.

"In a 2018 paper about monastic academies of the future, M. Bukiet lists three classic texts documenting the work of contemplative adepts. He thinks these will be central teachings for all future contemplatives.

&gt;Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras  
&gt;  
&gt;Tsongkhapa’s “The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment”  
&gt;  
&gt;Buddhaghosa’s “The Path of Purification”

I have not read the last two but plan to look into them for consideration. My current top three are:

* Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras
* Takpo Tashi Namgyal’s “Mahamudra: The Quintessence of Mind and Meditation
* Harold D. Roth trans. of “Original Tao: Inward Training (Nei-yeh)""

I know that there are many here that probably have many other resources in mind, not just three. But if you had to rank ***your top three*** resources for mediation purposes, what would they be?

Thanks for sharing.",0

"I normally do sitting meditation but lately I've been trying to meditate while lying in bed, either on my back or on my side, but it's like I can't even get started. I don't understand it, it's like I can't focus on the breath while having it ""feel good"" like it does in sitting meditation. Anyone know why this might be? Sometimes I can focus on the breath while lying down but it seems like it doesn't really go anywhere, like it's just a mechanical process or me forcing myself to follow the breath. 

Also what is really funny is that when I do sitting meditation too late at night, I'll get very drowsy and start nodding off, however, when I lay down in bed to go to sleep I am suddenly wide awake, and so I try to meditate laying down, and it doesn't make me sleepy at all, lol.",0
"I've been really wanting to get into meditation; I love the idea behind it and I see how powerful it can be. I've been reading the book 'The Mind Illuminated' to try and help me on this journey, the only issue is I was doing great with it. I was making a daily habit with mediation, I did for about a month, I got my practice up to 25-30 minutes a day. Life was good. It was easy to do with a still mind.

Well, things have changed. A lot of problems have risen within my family life, work life, and relationship life. Simply put, there are some BIG changes coming which are perceived as negative as of right now.. with all of these issues, my anxiety, depression, stress has been at an all time max. it constantly feels like my mind is cluttered and going a million miles an hour. I began putting meditation to the side because I felt too depressed to even try, it was too much ""effort"". I want to bring it back into my life because I felt like before I was just beginning to get the positive effects from meditation.. now each time I try and sit I can't seem to shut off that constant chatter, the obsessing looping thoughts - no matter how hard I try I can't push them away and focus on my breath. Being mindful has been difficult because things have been going to badly, it's almost as if I subconsciously do not want to be in the moment. 

How do I stop this and get that focus back?",0
How do I get back into meditation habit? I used to feel so good but I can’t do it recently these last few months have been rough since I got depersonalization. Meditation helped but now that it’s not as bad I stopped. I really need to mediate but for some reason I just can’t. I feel like crying right now. My mind is so mean to me. I tell myself I can’t feel love and I’m selfish and it’s not true I think I hope I just feel so lost right now. I don’t know how to act or what to do or what is right in social situations. I don’t know if this is what it’s like to be an adult or what happens when you leave adolescence behind but I can’t stop thinking about myself and I’m so insecure. Meditation used to make me feel so calm and good I feel like an asshole lately. I don’t even know why I’m wrong this right now. I used to think  it was cool to be a sociopath and it was a weird phase I idolized them but now everyone I see the word empathy my brain automatically is like “you don’t feel that” I’m crying now and my brain is fucked.,0
"The classic teaching on The Four Thoughts That Turn the Mind from Samsara, has helped me greatly to maintain a deep motivation to practice over the past three decades.  I'll share the opening lines which HH the 17th Karmapa gave several years ago. It's my belief that if you use these four thoughts to assist you in maintaining momentum in your daily life as well as practices, this will propel you along the way more consistently. Here's a short except, and the rest can be engaged from the attached link.

The Seventeenth Karmapa began his teaching by naming the Four Thoughts That Turn the Mind from Samsara: (1) the precious human rebirth; (2) death and impermanence; (3) karma as cause and effect; and (4) the defects of samsara.

"Earlier today I was at a grocery store, which was crowded because it's the weekend. Sometimes I get thoughts about how other people might judge me about various aspects of my behaviour there. These thoughts link to an unpleasant tense feeling which I guess involves anxiety and maybe shame. Somehow I let go of these thoughts, somehow just letting them be and not attaching them to my concept of self in the way which brought up those feelings. I felt a notable relief and a greater presence in the external world.

It wasn't like the thoughts weren't mine. Though I also can't say they seemed very clearly mine. It was more like I wasn't giving them the kind of significance found when I'm learning about and figuring out reality. They were just thoughts which appeared, not any kind of truth which was important and which I have to concern myself with.

When I did this, the thoughts faded. It seems the grasping at them which comes from feeling they are significant intensifies and prolongs them.

I'm not 100% certain that this is an okay thing to do. Afterwards I was wondering if it was escapist. Sometimes it seems I experience concerns about myself via anxiety about other people judging me for activities which aren't very loving to myself. In the more distant past, I used to buy sweet baked goods regularly at a grocery store, and I was anxious about cashiers judging me for that. Those things are unhealthy, and it's like the part of me which didn't want them expressed itself that way. Simply letting go of such things could be a further dissociation from emotions and escapism. I already know how to do various kinds of escapism in my mind, and don't want to learn more. But maybe I should have some faith in how others view this, and maybe it is something better than the escapism I've learned to do on my own in my mind.",0
"I am a creative type with thoughts and ideas always flowing through my head. This type of thinking is necessary for what I do (game development) both for the coding end of things and the creative aspect. It is also an essential part of who I am. Over the past few years I have had several mental disorders get much worse; OCD, anxiety, and ADHD. I also have big problems with discipline and impulse control. I decided I might try to get into to meditation to calm down my mind and help take control of things, however, I have been scared of meditating ever since a few years ago when I read some of The Mind Illuminated and practiced it a bit.

After every time I would meditate, my mind would be completely silent. No thoughts, no ideas, nothing. Even if I tried to conjure something up, it was just like there was nothing to conjure. All I had was pure awareness. It really freaked me out because my mind is usually going a million miles an hour. Obviously a calm mind is desirable, but to the point that it takes away my ability to think and be creative like the way I used to, that would not be good. So is this a normal effect of meditation? Is this something that will in the end make me less imaginative and ambitious? Is this just a step in the process or the end goal?",0
"Hello, r/meditation, I’m a teenage girl who is starting to try meditation I’m on a five day streak with guided meditation and I’m proud of myself. But free trials on apps like “Balance” only last so long and I don’t have the funds to buy a month of guidance that’s why I’m here. Does anybody here know short guided meditation apps/playlists from around 3 to 5 minutes 10 I also fine but I don’t know whether I can hold my attention for that long at this stage. I really hope you guys can help as I use meditation to lower stress and anxiety. I have tried looking at r/audiomeditation. But find that those recordings are a bit to long for me

Thank you in advance",0
Late last night I was driving and an image of myself popped up in my head from a few years back. The intensity of this image in my head was something I had never experienced before. I have to say it was not good emotions tied a long to it. Shame and embarrassment were the feelings that came to mind. In this moment it was the first time that I had actually truly became disgusted with who I once was. For some reason I feel like this directly tied with meditation as I practice everyday. If any of you have experienced this I would like your opinion on what is happening. Thanks.,0

"Almost all the meditation books I have read tell you to keep your spine erect, I have struggled with this for years due to having back and shoulder problems and although I am able to do it without as much problems it is problematic enough that it often can put me off practicing at all and I am just wondering if anyone else struggles with this and found they sometimes find their practice goes better when they lean back than be straight",0
"I'm curious about studying styles of meditation outside of the Buddhist and Hindu contexts that we usually encounter them in.

After I meditate I'm often left with this feeling that I need to let something go. I can feel it welling up inside of me and I always want to cry but I feel unable. I cry very infrequently but I feel like I'm holding on to something that I need to let go of. Any tips on how to allow myself to cry?,0
"If I were trying to meditate on sexual urges I guess it wouldn’t be totally strange to leak semen. However, it just kinda happened during my 30 minute meditation. I have been under a lot of stress lately and dealing with some shame from a traumatic event and usually when this happens I tend to go back to what comforts me as a safety net and that’s usually sexual feelings. During my meditation it was difficult for me to move this energy upward it felt like it was blocked. At the end of my meditation I noticed I had seminal fluid leaking. I’ve also  been practicing semen retention so I’m wondering if I just have too much energy stored right now and I’m not transmuting it correctly.",0
"I’ve been mediating for two months now, 30 mins at a time. I still can’t concentrate for more than 2 or 3 breaths before my mind starts to wander.

I’m interested in how long others last, and how long you’ve been mediating.",0
"As of last week I [25/M] decided to stick to meditating and have meditated for 5 consecutive days. I have started a course on Insight Timer for obsessive thinking which is 10-15 mins usually and listen to a love kindness meditate on youtube which is 15 mins. I have actually teared up several times during the love and kindness meditation. 

I’m hitting the gym and working out despite being tired or unmotivated and feel so great after. 

I have not yet fixed a sleeping schedule, but I’m trying my best. I’m sleeping at 1-2AM and waking up at 7:30AM and going back to bed from 10AM-1:30AM. I think this is important too. 

My diet has been very well, but as I am heavy lifting now I do think I need more bigger meals.

However, I still suffer from obsessive thinking. I’m fully aware that there is nothing wrong with me. Throughout the day I have moments of peace and calmness. But also get the occasional moment when I’m too much into my head. And keep obsessively thinking about the question “what if I’m suicidal” and I have seen a therapist about this and she said I show no signs of being suicidal and it’s simply my response mechanism for when I’m stressed. I have talked to friends, and family and everyone says the same thing. I also don’t feel suicidal, I don’t want to die or hurt myself. I actually wanna get rid of these thoughts. I don’t think of anything negative aside from this question. But my anxiety will produce chemicals throughout my body and my face (cheeks) will flair up and this gives me anxiety. 

Has anyone ever overcome this? Am I just too stuck in my head?",0
"Has helped me immensely. That is all.

Edit: thanks for all the upvotes and comments!",0
"I think I’m realizing that my entire life has been focused *against* meditation. I’ve always tried to remember song lyrics for times when I am bored or to try and keep me in a certain mindset while I perform activities. I recite things and cling to memories and try to recreate them in my head in order to remind myself of pain and truth. 

Recently this has been out of my control. Things just attack and invade my head. Everything is an echo. There’s never silence. I can’t look at something without connecting it to everything its related to. I can’t think about anything without turning over every single possibility imaginable. I can’t hear a word without trying to recall every important context of where I’ve heard this word. I can’t learn something new without feeling like I’ll be questioned on it. 

I feel like a slave to my own head and my own emotions. I sought darkness.. and now I feel like I am finally realizing the price I am paying.. Is there a specific type of meditation to help with this?",0
"Im fairly new to meditation, and was actually doing it while trying to have an astral projection.

I suddenly felt this overwhelming sensation that i was ok with death, and literally had a series of memories play in my mind from waaaay back to before i could walk (my first memory, havent revisited it in awhile and honestly forgot about it) and important memories of events in my life played out in chronological order.

It was extremely disturbing in all honesty and im wondering if this is common.

I probably could of just got up at any time but it was like i was in a trance and compelled to watch.

I also realized that i cant remember anything from 3rd grade...

And that my anxiety disorder, self consciousness and concentration issues began in 7th grade (anxiety), and 8th grade (concentration after a severe concussion and self consciousness after serious weight gain).

and depersonalization in 9th grade while in the shower in my old house.

depression last year (i knew this was recent but I was able to finally recall the events leading up to the trigger)

These things all skew perception and make it hard to pinpoint when they really started, but i remembered the exact moment tonight.

Maybe I can use this to really get to the root of my issues and fix them, though...

But by far one of the weirdest experiences of my life.

All this as im escaping alcoholism, im literally still feeling withdrawals.


Id like to add, this wasnt just ""memories"", it was VIVID. Not the typical greyed out old memories where you cant recall detail, it was truly bizzare and probably atypical.",0
"In Buddhism, there is what is called [Two truths doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine). Whatever blissful or mystical experiences one experiences, insights into things like non-self, impermanence, emptiness, they too just pass. Back to the breath. For I will surely get lost in thought again, and that is okay.

Mindfulness meditation leads to forgiveness. With healthy forgiveness and compassion, we do not excuse their behaviour. And we do so while maintaining our healthy boundaries - indeed, healthy boundaries likely result from states of forgiveness: for to reach these states requires forgiveness and compassion for yourself, knowing your own limits and imperfections, and what you deserve from a place of self-love. In fight or flight, I have felt anger. I have felt hatred. I have felt revenge. And when not mindful, it is projection. But, with mindfulness, they too are impermanent. They are not self. They are empty.

When I am not mindful, and that's a fuckload, split thinking and cognitive dissonance are some of my deeply engrained schemas - likely to manifest in and out of my mind until death. Subsequent anger after bouts of forgiveness can lead to perfectionsitic guilt, which regresses back to mind narratives of past and future - and that being my states of forgiveness weren't genuine. More and more, I hold my justified anger with mindfulness, compassion, and forgiveness. It is not mine. It is human emotions functioning, arising out of prior causes and conditions. And I see that forgiveness, like grief, is not linear - it is cyclic and unpredictable. It is not mine to control. And that's fucking cool.

For many, deep pain can be classified as 'trauma'. How bizarre it is to realise that the unconscious mind is in the body. Given that I am susceptible to intellectualise too much (probably these words, haha), when I found this out, it was like, ""what the fuck? Am I the last one to realise? Why didn't you all tell me?!"" How exciting that science is starting to see this more and more - The Body Keeps The Score indeed! And in my own experience, in states of mindfulness and focusing on Buddha's amazingggg three marks of existence, how this pain is not mine. It is inteergenrational trauma. It is unconscious scripts past down like emotional imprints. How curious.

With forgiveness, we are free of the past. We are free of the story between this person, largely fictitious, that reinforces the illusory self. With compassion, we see they did not choose their thoughts or their behaviour. They, too, are victims. And they project their pain onto you, however unconscious.

It is fear or love. Fear will never beat fear. Fear or love. Love. It is all Love.",0
"Like the title suggests, what should I exactly be doing when I meditate? Is it as easy as acknowledging your thoughts and letting them pass by you? How do you even acknowledge your thoughts without thinking about it? For example, would you just think I just thought about X or okay that’s nice but ignore it or just silently ignore it?

I have a feeling I’m missing an essential part about meditation.",0
"This is (roughly) how a friend summarized my explanation after I described the point of meditation.

Just like you train your brain to recognize dreams and gain control over them by repeatedly writing them down in dream diaries, meditation trains the brain to recognize when you live your life on autopilot, follow neurotic patterns, and so on, and puts you back into the driver seat.

It clearly doesn't capture all components of meditation, such as the improved focus, the reduced stress, the reminder that your desires and day-to-day struggles are not as important as you think, ... Yet I think it's quite a nice metaphor for this particular component. :)",0

"From what I've understood, mindfulness meditation is simply put emptying your mind and being aware while concentration meditation is focusing on something.

What will it take to drop clinging to views? (*ditthupadana*)

Most western folks are taught to believe in things, so it is natural for one who is interested in Buddhism to take up many views that are associated with Buddhism.

Here some common beliefs:

1. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds.
2. There is an afterlife.
3. And there are ascetics and brahins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.

There are some good reasons to have these beliefs, and they are very common in Asia and part of the Religion of Buddhism. These are ordinary right views that are common, held by the leaders of society down to the lowest.

There is another way to view things, the Buddha’s noble way. Noble right view is based on wisdom and investigation, to make the mind pure noble and free from ordinary views.

Most Buddhist and other folks who practice anapanasati and/as vipassana generally are looking for leaving dissatisfaction and enter into satisfaction (dukkha-dukkha-niroda), they are looking for freedom. Yet clinging to any of the above views will keep the mind trapped in ordinary views.

So for those who aspire to be free from unsatisfactory ness, What will it take to give up these ordinary common views and enter into Noble right view? What would convince you that anatta is real and can not be reborn? The Pali Cannon is not the infallible word of Buddha and is poorly teranslated? That it has been messed with by ordinary folks.

It boils down to the same thing: *Tell us what your price is. Where your line is drawn? Your conditions? What will it take to give up views?*

"I went in 55 minutes straight.
My biggest struggle was lowering my expectations of what was to come.
And I would say right around the last ten minutes I finally let go and let it all in.

Meaning I stoped trying so hard.
The whole time I could feel it.
My ego..thinking it could just try hard and get their. And that wasn't the case.

Once I stoped refusing to relax and and trying to navigate something or some space I truly don't know. I broke threw. But to what I'm not sure. The visuals weren't there. But this time I could feel something trying to heal me.
More specifically in my brain.
I could feel the vanes in my brain...
And they didn't feel damaged...I mean what would I know from my experiences.
But this time felt real like my energy was drawn to this point in my head and I felt like blood was finally circulating freely threw it and with a lot of power.

Here is a bit of my background on dmt before I finish...
I once met this lady when I broke threw under the blood moon this year.
It was a tragic week for me but I still decided to break threw ( I'm not the one to take a bad experience as bad their all just experiences) when I broke threw I was held by the most beautiful women warrior I've ever met. She was so beautiful I couldn't stand to look for more then a few seconds and incould tell she was a warrior but that explanation is for another time
...my little brain couldn't comprehend her, she closed my eyes and told me to relax and gave me all of the answers I ever needed up until that point. If you guys wanna know more I'll make a video and post it.

But the point being I've been receiving a deep love from something and I think it's her. Before my meditating ended tonight I felt my third eye Beginning to calm down and close and the vanes and space in my brain felt extremely clear, then I heard I love you. Now normally I have thoughts on top of thoughts in the beginning of my sessions. I'm a deep thinker and a quick one at that I also disassociate on a healthy level. So im aware of why and what I'm thinking and the tone and feeling. But this....This was another entitiy entirely and it felt like her...from my DMT trip, words escape me and I wish I could express this better but I know deep down she's been following me, 

PS side not : I stoped pulling tarot cards because I kept getting signs of her and my ex girlfriend popping up in the reading. I've literally pulled the same cards for weeks, and I'm not to good at there interpretation of them. So I finally gave in and up and couldn't handle the truth..which was hard to handle and frustrating because I didn't know how to reach the entity on the other side with out DMT or make amends with someone who we equally didn't want to see me as much as I didn't want to see her anymore....so those I began to search for healing and exploration to how we could meet and how I could forgive myself and ex girl. 
 And im shocked to say I'm not sure if life is much under our control even though we have choices that make us feel free I don't think we are to much free of how we really feel on the inside...only how we plan to get there..sorry if that sounds dark I just think freedom is 50% reality and the other 50 is something big the soul ... something I really need to get to know 

Thanks for reading ❤️🖤",0
"I really need to get this off my chest or my mind rather, it may seem silly, but for a long long time now. I've had a serious problem that has led to my self-help journey. This problem is a problem of not visual concentration because I have 20/20 vision, it is mental concentration. This may seem really ridiculous and it is to me as I write it out, but it's a mental problem of being unable to fully focus on an image as a whole like on a screen or a picture, drawing, art, etc. It started with anime for some reason, I guess it was something so foreign that I guess I couldn't understand it, I needed to know why they drew people or told stories the way they did. I needed to understand shapes and line work and the importance of that and what it means chemically, scientifically, culturally and other shit. Low and behold I realized I was just overthinking like an idiot. Discovered Sadhguru about overthinking and instantly stopped. I'm better now, but this for some reason has led me to search for something more for some reason, like I wanted to know the true meaning behind everything. I was and a little bit still am in fear of not enjoying things to their fullest, so in order to do that, I took things apart in order to find some info or evidence that would allow me to truly appreciate it in its highest form. I would focus on things like the shape of the hair, why is it so unorderly I guess, not fixed; in everything I did this. This problem came in stuff like animated movies, movies, and art in general. idk why, but i guess i needed to understand all to be all. Now I can't even focus on an image as a whole like in the present moment. It doesn't drive me nuts, but it empairs me fully enjoying something in the present. Sorry for a long story.",0
"hi, thanks for helping

1- how to forgive people who hurt you, been nasty (without any reason), bullied you

2-how to forgive life for being so unfair

3-how to forgive life for giving more to people who are 'bad', specifically people who has done bad stuff to me

4-how to forgive myself for a single past mistake, knowing that i am a perfectionist and really can't stand hurting anyone, or annoying them, etc.

a bit of background

concerning others: toxic household, bullied at school, rejected ALTHOUGH i was nice, modest, humble, physically well, , with an interesting life etc. teachers also unfair and nasty.

(for many reasons, my environment was bad and i didn't have an alternative for it)

concerning me: i uesd to be close with my mum and we'd argue. during the argument, she became cold and very distand, and it drove me crazy, which lead to bigger arguments. always felt guilty, didn't feel relieved until we made piece.

so i carry some guilt almost all the time. being bullied is a reason to this. i feel like i owe people something, i feel like i should please please etc.

i don't really care about people in my past, i hold no grudge against them but i definitely have an overall bitterness feeling. it affects how i interact with people currently.  it affects me as i feel i shouldn't be successful because people won't like me or will be threatened. i feel i shouldn't take care of myself because people won't like me. and it's true, when i used to be really smarter, more mature, than people of my age, and naturally gifted in many things (looks, money, voice, memory, academic abilities etc), i've NEVER had any appreciation except maybe a bit from my mum and a very few dear teachers. i was fought against, made fun of, people tried to bring me down, etc. so, i feel like if i let people be better than me, i get more peace of mind (it's true, believe it or not... until uni. at uni people changed and they ""like"" successful people who put effort in looks and studies and hobbies. but now it's too late, what's done is done and i feel like i want to be ""nobody"" so that i get no obstacles and hate and jealousy etc etc.

how can i get past everything i've been through? is there any way to forget everything related to past (especially knowing i have a very very good memory)?

second, i've done something quite awful during a long mental breakdown (not just months). a friend of mine, he hurt me, and i've done stuff in reaction to what he's done, that are not ethical. he doesn't know but if he did, he would be very hurt (understandable). i also feel i shouldn't be friends with him and shouldn't be cool and fun to be around with him because i'd be giving him a wrong insight about me . So yeah. not sure how to move forward. i think about it every single day. not sure how to be done with this. in addition to the guilt feeling i mentioned before, i now feel guilty because of this. it worsens the feeling that i don't deserve to be successful, pretty, etc etc.

any tip, advice, insight, similar experience is welcome.

p.s.: i always notice that ""good"", genuine people have a life that's shittiest than those who are not that good. it's not a coincidence, i'm talking about loads of people. anyone can explain ? :(",0

I was planning on buying dandapani's new course called unwavering focus, which you can purchase from the app. I was wondering how is that different from the online course he has. Also, if I am just looking to increase concentration should I buy the meditation course as well or just stick with unwavering focus because as a student $249 is a lot. How is the meditation course different from the unwavering focus? Is it worth an extra $200? I would highly appreciate your reply.

I’ve been meditating for a couple years now and a lot of the time, while I’m doing it, I’ll remember things from my childhood that I haven’t thought of in years. They are mostly visual scenes, but sometimes they are smells as well. I sometimes use tarot cards (just for fun) and I’ll experience the same thing while I’m picking out the cards; however, unlike when I’m meditating, the images are stronger and more concrete, if that makes sense?

Does anyone else experience this or something like it?? Would anyone be kind enough to explain why this happens? Is it just because of how relaxed I am? I’m very interested to know!",0

"Long story short, i had a lot of friends in middle school and was quite outgoing(still a quiet kid but i could at least make new friends and the majority of people liked me) . In high school we moved to a new town and i struggled to make friends there. I became very lonely throughout my high school career and lost my social skills. I am now in my senior year. Recently i have decided to work on getting over my social anxiety. I tried to be more fearless and be myself more. I've had good days but as soon as i start thinking about how well it is going, i immediately start overthinking and relapsing.

An old friend of mine and the only one i still have contact with said that his nieces friend needed a date for her prom. I decided to say yes because it could be a great opportunity to work om my social skills. Yesterday, me and thus girl went to go drink a coffee and get to know one another and it was really awkward. I just couldn't use the social skills that i have been working on for the past few months. I am so stressed now and i cant stop thinking about it and literally can't think about anything else besides how bad the date went and the fact that i have to go to prom with her on tuesday. I know this isn't evem so bad and that the logical thing to do would be to be more aware of these anxious thoughts and learn from them and from my mistakes i made during the date but i just cant escape the thought. Even ehen i was with my two friends today, i just sat there quietly because i could not enjoy myself in the moment as i usually do and kept thinking about that date. I have been having this knot feeling in my stomach that hasnt stopped. Even when i meditate, i cant stop thinking about it. I try to just observe the thought but i just cant. It's like my mind is trapped in a cage that i put myself in and threw the keys away. I have tried to do other things like reading and gaming just to get my mind of it but nothing works. I cant even enjoy those activities. This is driving me insane.",0

"It’s really hard for me to let go of anger. I want vengeance. I want to get even. I want those who have hurt me to also hurt. I want people to get what they deserve. I have a lot of hate in my heart. 

I know this isn’t helpful. On paper I have a relatively easy time rationalizing it. I just can’t seem to believe it. I can tell it to myself but the feelings don’t dissipate. I can’t quite grasp the concept that if person A wrongs me for selfish reasons, that they are somehow worse off and I am somehow better off. Maybe in the long run. But I feel like I need to justify it. 

I have used pain a lot to better myself. Every time I was hurt I would try and do something productive or successful to be better and drive forward. Then I got good at it. I would sometimes intentionally hurt myself since it provided a lot of fuel. Eventually I burnt out. But I’m realizing the hate is still there. It was once fire but now has turned to venom and poison. 

I think I am in a lot of pain. I cannot find peace at all. I try to meditate and talk to my support network, but eventually the darkness always falls on me. Does anyone have any advice?",0
"Hi all.  I hope your having a pleasant and mindful day. 😌

I've been going through some tough emotions lately, and although my normal breath focused meditation is helping directly somewhat, I think it potentially will help me more by making me realize how low my self-confidence is.  I've always been aware of my low self confidence, but I'm now becoming more aware of how it brings me to these negative emotional states in the first place.

Anyway, I'm looking for recommendations of some of your favorite loving kindness guided meditations with a focus on being kinder and more loving to yourself.

I've done a few loving kindness meditations in the past, but I think I would really benefit from adding one to my daily meditations.

Any recommendations will be greatly appreciated!  I hope you all can view the world just as it is today, and take solace in your own internal calm.

I went in with a new mantra.

And boy I wish I could really tell you In full detail but most words escape me. It all kind of happened at once. Beautiful colors and spaces within spaces. They only lasted a few moments. 
My heart knew I wasn't ready to go completely all of the way. Though my ego was pushing really hard with each heart beat that thumped I grew closer but I still harbor feelings against people I don't want to carry with me to where ever my spirit is breaking threw too

I have a history of anger and I can hold a grudge like an elephant.
So instead of going all of the way my instinct put on the breaks. My mind set believes I don't hold the pieces of peace yet but now that I have seen.. I know what's up..and I know what I have to do. 
And I'm going to have a burning session soon to free up what ever I can't reach like a deep tissue ache in my muscles that needs a professional. I just want to be safe so I can do what I came to do with no more distractions 😉

"“Sitting meditation is not, as is often supposed, a spiritual ‘exercise’, a practice followed for some ulterior object. From a Buddhist standpoint, it is simply the proper way to sit, and it seems perfectly natural to remain sitting so long as there is nothing else to be done, and so long as one is not consumed with nervous agitation. To the restless temperament of the West, sitting meditation may seem to be an unpleasant discipline, because we do not seem to be able to sit ‘just to sit’ without qualms of conscience, without feeling that we ought to be doing something more important to justify our existence. To propitiate this restless conscience, sitting meditation must therefore be regarded as an exercise, a discipline with an ulterior motive. Yet in the Buddhist sense, for where there is purpose, where there is seeking and grasping for results, there is no dhyana (Zen)” - Alan Watts :)",0

"For years I've adopted the common practice of ""catching"" myself thinking into the past or the future; utilizing the idea that time is a mind-derived concept. I wanted to create a visualization that could act as a reminder to help bring me back to the present moment, so I started to visualize a book. The left side of the book would designate the past while the right side of the book would represent the future. Ideally, I would exist at the binding of the book or at a single word of a page; this acting as the present moment.

As I held this visualization, it dawned on me that this representation may actually cause an identification with time. I'm saying ""I recognize past and future don't exist"" but at the same time creating its existence by visual representation. This realization created a shift in my perception; by viewing time as linear in this way, I hadn't fully let go of the hold time had on my life.

I'm finding it hard to put into words, but in meditative practice it may feel something like this:

* *""I've caught myself anxious about the future, therefor I will bring myself back to the present moment""*

vs.

* *""I've caught my mind perceiving the concept of future. I recognize this is an illusion of the mind and I accept that this present moment is all that exists""*

This was a meaningful shift to me so I'm hoping it may provide value to others. If anyone can elaborate on this idea I would love to hear it!",0

"Hello!

I've been meditating here and there for the past month. I hadn't noticed much of a difference in my mindset so I decided to take a more disciplined approach and make it a daily practice. I've meditated every day this week and the past two days ran into an interesting problem I didn't anticipate.

How the hell do you meditate when you just don't want to?

I power through the impulse saying ""To hell with it. Go make some coffee."" I set a timer. I lie down. I breathe. I try not to try too hard and just allow it to happen. Then the timer goes off yet I never quite got into the zone.

I learned that consistency is of the utmost importance when building a new habit two years ago when I got back into working out. Even when I really didn't want to do anything physical at all I still tried. Twenty push ups are better than zero push ups. Beyond building the habit there was definite benefit in just the attempt itself.

Aside from building or maintaining the habit, do you find benefit in the mere attempt at meditation? How does it feel to simply go through the motions?",0

"Meditation is important. Sleep is important. Exercise is important. I feel best on a day if I get at least 8 hrs sleep, 45 minutes of vigorous exercise, and 20 minutes of meditation.

"I get stuck on thoughts, sometimes repeating thought cycles dozens or even hundreds of times.  It's something I've discussed and had diagnosed as part of a clinical anxiety complex.

I do not really believe in all the ""energy"" stuffs. Thank you.

I'm looking for books or texts in spanish about meditation. Secular if possible. I have a friend who is very interested in meditation but prefers to read in spanish (and even I prefer it sometimes).

"Hello. Does anyone have the same problem as me? When I graduated from high school, I started to take meditation seriously. I felt some of the greatest joys and stillness during that period of my life. I remember going for walks at 11pm during winter and immersing myself in what seemed to be a distant world. However, when I started to work, take classes, and worry about what I would do with my life (parents would remind me that I have to make my own life), I stopped meditating. I recently realized why I stopped. When I meditate, my mind feels free and untethered. However, my mind eventually remembers the work, the school, the crossroads that I'm at as an adult and all of my social anxieties. I realized that that process of ""coming back"" to reality after meditation is painful. I know that the original Pali Canon recommended people into meditation to live a life in seclusion and in nature and I want to do that, but I live near D.C. in an urbanized area. For those like me, what do you do? I wish that there were more natural spaces scattered throughout my community to sit in.",0
"Staying present during formal practice is hard. But getting yourself to stay present throughout the day is even harder given all the distractions around us. What are some ways you stay present throughout the day? Or other ways to remind yourself to be in the “here and now”.

I’ve been using a mala bracelet and I’ve found that periodically ‘counting’ with it helps bring me back...... Breathe in, breathe out, 1 .... Breathe in, breathe out, 2 ... and so on. Just doing this from time to time is a helpful way to bring yourself back when you lose sight of the present.",0

"Hello all,

Recently I’ve been probing into meditation and I wanted to get advice on an experience I’ve been having. I’ve been trying to do some mindfulness meditation every once and a while when I need to walk an appreciable distance in my day to day life. When I try to just listen to my sensory perceptions, however, I can get into this trance like state that feels rather lonely and disturbing. It is a rather difficult emotional experience to explain but I’ll do my best to draw a picture. When I try to just notice sounds, sights, smells, etc. for what they are, i can’t help but feel like reality is, for lack of a better word, naked. I think it’s a similar feeling that would occur if one were to watch an animal body decompose or watch hundreds of insect larvae hatch from a breeding ground - this kind of detached observation of something vulgar, intensely interested in itself, and just inevitably sort of there. I know I probably already sound very pretentious, but I’ll risk sounding even more so by saying that the “thereness” of the world overwhelms me, leaving me feel both totally isolated as an observer of things and in a trance because of how inescapable this all feels. It’s like being stuck in a bad situation for too long, even if you struggled at the beginning eventually you just accept the place you’re in with a detached, unpleasant indifference. 

Certainly I can see someone telling me that it isn’t reality saying these things to me, but what I with my preconceptions on existence (ie that it’s vulgar, overwhelming, etc) am saying to myself, but I can’t seem to help it; as much as I try to unravel the thread further, there doesn’t seem to be a level of experience beyond this kind of state where things do nothing but nakedly exist. 

Is there any sort of mental space I should try to get myself into before I try mindfulness, or anything I may be doing wrong? Because listening to the world as I know how to do clearly doesn’t work. I’ve heard that meditative practices often try to transcend one’s sense of self for pure presence in the moment - based on my (admittedly few) experiences, that sounds really dreadful to me, and I can’t conceptualize a way in which that would be something worth working towards.",0
"So I normally don't share my experience. I have a I firm belief what we go threw can be often individual. But I'm learning slowly otherwise to still try and share.

I have been practicing meditating for over five or six years now. Slowly picking up the pace as time passed and life became more difficult 💔. 

I normally had a basic time. Especially over the past three years. Ya know how it goes. You learn to let go and build on yourself.
It's all been a blast, tones of tears plenty of smiles and a few cries that I never knew my heart was holding on too. Dad issues bad relationships and what ever I neglected along the way. I've also grown adept to my own energy 

But I've come to the big punch.
My anger, and lack of love. 

Now  to give you a hint most of my relationships friendship or love ship. Have been heavley karmic, and it finally dawned on me I'm the oldest male still around in my family ( grandfather dead. Dad miss placed, uncle is to far gone in his brain due to drugs to know what's up from down) I'm the one people come to for a lot. It's no burden though. But I started to notice the lack of true significant others ( love ) in my family's lineage. Now I've over looked this several times...until today. 
a lot of pieces fell together kind of all at once like when you don't know the answer to a question on a test so you skip it and your forced to come back because you want a 100% on this thing we call life.. 

to not lose your attention I'll wrap this up quick and simple . I decided to ask myself and what ever good spirits that follow my life and my family's life what's the deal with my anger why does my family struggle with love, I mean it's deep man real deep, and it's even deeper for the woman in my family, mom divorced two and the third died of a heart attack at a really early age. Dude was an athlete who's family had no prior history just to give you a taste. Me my luck's been a bit better but to no avail still kinda the same just no actual death

So I said screw it I need to know.
And with deep affirmation I dove deep.
Now I'm able to meditate for about an hour before my (will) realizes we have other stuff to do, so here is the best part... 
I asked the same question over and over again why am I angry.. I need the answer was always the under thought as well ..not want or please.. simply keeping the vibe I know the answer is here some where.

I was basically on the hunt for the White rabbit in my life that always got away. And with a steady fast heart Im sure I came into contact with something epic. 
While pushing my energy to poor from my body...which was kinda foolish with out the right protection I might add I eventually was pushed from the right side of my body.

Now I know the difference between your body flinching during meditation and being pushed.

The only problem is I didn't have time to retrain my focus.. remember I'm only adept to this.

The next stage was quick I felt warm and all of my energy I had been collecting around my body swopped away super quick.
Now normally I get super warm at the beginning of my meditating which makes sense to me because I'm coming into focus.
I eventually normalize and get used to the heat. 

Not knowing how to handle it I called for friends and family living and none living to help aid in a quick recovery so I could bounce back and chase what ever had done this to me  so it could do not do it again. Because it didn't feel right or justified..
I came to the conclusion a true friendly entity comes in peace not but force. It's smooth and consenting like a puzzle piece that most go to it's place by design.

After a some what of a quick recovery from imagery and breathing techniques brought threw a thought cycle I was normalized again and feeling my flow. 

I hauleted my rage for I am not the one to be pushed.
And thought back to what I was thinking before this had occurred..ya k ow action reaction things don't happen for no real reason in my life 

I remember thinking I would die to help my family figure this out I would give up myself to know what I can do to help my family and ancestors be stronger for the past and Future *and that's when it came*

So with a good eye on what I wanted I restrained myself from over reacting.
I've heard succubus will just consume more energy from you if you keep trying to dish out to attack, ive heard from others that they had to change the emotions of the attack to throw them off to do real damage..but I wanted to not fight with rage just peace.
 
I've learned from the repercussions of war with real people and I can only imagine what it's like to fight on an astral plane. The spiritual suffering after has to be insane.

So I always assure in this mantra of peace
( I do not wish to make energy to harm damage or cause pain, if you stay you will be transformed by my love and will to live)


I know what it's like to hunger threw anger and other negative emotions. 

So I'd rather not hurt anything that's just trying to survive. 
And it worked I slowly came back to full intense body vibe and flow and after a swift check of my surroundings I kept hearing small sounds all over my room I never hear much before while meditating. But this time was different it was my first time trying binureal beats 
Now normally I can pick up on this stuff because I'm not wearing headphones , it's ether the (A/C or my cat) and it definitely wasn't the A/C Becuase I couldn't hear or feel it and I had not heard my cat actually messing around 
...in fact he came back into the room about two minutes after I was done
And my cats a dick when he wants to be childish he goes all out..now me and my cat are super close and cool like we talk to each other. Even though it's just a bunch of loud meows and me just asking simple obvious questions he only does it primarily with me, so it's comforting to so the least. I came to the conclusion what ever it was had to be messing with the posters on my Walls...I have a bunch that aren't properly taped down. 

This may sound insane I know ..so I did hesitate to share and I'm really glad you read this. I'm going to have to make some  protective moves from here on out so I don't end up like Alice I wonderland and I'll let you guys know how my family's anger works out from here.

I have a feeling it's only just getting started.",0
"While I’m on my second 5 minute meditation I see blue orbs/disc getting smaller, and getting larger as time goes. I looked up what the blue disc or one can be, and I came across something called a blue pearl. If I’m not mistaking, when you see the blue pearl it means you either see God, your soul in this universe, or it’s your eyes being closed so long that your eyes retinas makes this possible. Not being egotistical about it, I just want to know the true meaning behind it, thanks :)",0

"It’s like my neck gave up supporting my head and then it starts to slowly fall backward and my eyes also feel like they are trying to open fully.

"I direct my attention to a particular muscle (I feel slight tingles), and subsequently when I consciously relax that muscle (heavy tingles). 

1) does anyone experience this
2) what’s happening here physiologically? 

Also, How does that translate when this attention is then shifted to the brain? My intuition is that you could direct blood flow and/or electrical activity to specific parts of your brain and so presumably giving the frontal lobe more attention may enhance executive functioning.

What do you guys think? any research on this is much appreciated",0
"I meditate daily, sometimes alone, sometimes with a meditation group on campus, sometimes both. 

I attend weekly Buddhist groups.

I have read enough books to have a pretty solid grasp on how to meditate.

What can I do to ensure I keep advancing and growing in my practice? Retreats?(I don't really have time for that right now, I am a busy college student.) Longer meditation sessions? More books? Nothing?

"Hello! 

So recently I’ve had this feeling of tension or pressure right in between my eyebrows. It feels like the beginning of a headache or as if I was furrowing my brows except, I’m not.

"I’ve been meditating daily for the past 2 months now. I use Headspace as my meditation app of choice. A month ago I went through a breakup and I’ve been heartbroken ever since and I find meditation very helpful. 

Ever since the breakup, I started meditating even more, a minimum of 2 to 5 times daily instead of once everyday when I started out. It definitely helps me with thoughts about my relationship. 

Though, only recently that I started feeling my heartbeat. It’s the same kind of feeling you would feel while going on a run or while you’re nervous. 

At first, I thought that it was because of the breakup, because when I close my eyes, I start to feel it. I tried putting my hand on my chest but I don’t feel anything. It’s weird because I thought my heart beats faster just like when I run, you know when you run and your heart beats fast, you can feel it with your hand. In my chest, I feel like it goes faster but I don’t feel anything with my hand. 

I wonder if anyone feels this also. I also would like to mention that I feel so much calmer after meditating, it puts me in a very calm enjoyable state. I don’t know if that’s the reason behind it, meaning I’m just more in tune with my body.",0

Namaste.. I am a spiritual seeker and used to see lots of videos and read spiritual books. But all books and videos on YouTube were incomplete and was not helping any more.

"Anyone’s rumination and intrusive thinking worse on CBD because it causes lack of motivation and discipline?!

I’ve been taking 15 mg full spectrum CBD oil capsules (with low THC) 1-2/day. I’ve noticed it calms my PTSD startle responses in public but it also makes me become more apathetic, unmotivated, and lazier. I notice I have less discipline to practice meditation and stop myself from ruminating and thinking of intrusive thoughts. My mind keeps resisting the CBD calmness and I keep ruminating non stop. This is my second day of migraines and I think it’s because of the nonstop ruminating. I think the CBD is making this worse. I also wonder if my mind is ruminating even more with cbd because it is not used to the calmness and is trying to cause mental distress to go back to that fight or flight State I am used to as a form of self sabotage (I keep thinking about distressing memories). I also notice CBD oil makes it harder for me to process my emotions as it has a numbing effect. Maybe I am taking too much?",0

"my alarm goes off and I immediately sit up take my meditation pillow place it under my butt and focus on breath for half an hour. 

This morning I wake up and to my pleasure I find that both nostrils are functioning perfectly! Wonderful!

Within moments after sitting up, my nose starts running and then I start sneezing uncontrollably for at least a couple minutes. Reset the timer.

I will not waiver. Taking a small piece of tissue paper I push it up one nostril, apparently the sinuses decided it's  time to drain the swamp,  and each time I need to breathe in I pull out that other nostril  with my fingers.

I refused to succumb!

"Before the interview, I was waiting at ths lobby and felt nervous, but decided to pay mindful attention to the surroundings and notice the people coming to work instead, and anxiety subsided.

Although, when I got called in to do a written test as the first stage of the interview, I kind got lost in thought when planning and writing the essay, and barely made the time limit. 

This leads me to the question: what does being mindful in the context of doing a writing task or task that involves thinking mean? If you become so absorbed in the task that you lose track/awareness of the physical surroundings, is that comsidered as being mindful? Are you supposed to become ""swallowed up"" by the task? To illustrate, I am typimg this on the train, and while typing this I was not aware of the passing of stops, and before I knew it it was my stop. Does mindfulness mean being aware of how the train is stopping at every station while I type this, or does mindfulness include being so absorbed in a task until you block out everything else?

EDIT: I guess the gist of it is: if you focus completely on doing one thing to the extent of blocking out everything else, such as typing this post on my phone while on the train, to the extemt that I was not aware of the passing of stops - does that count as being mindful?",0
"The title is a more ""pretty"" way of saying that when I meditate I will eventually hit a point where there's a sensation in my finger tips.

This feeling starts to envelope my body from my spine and can sometimes feel frightening, but also very warm and comforting. Then I'm left sitting there with what feels like no body just watching my thoughts roll by. Some of which can be a bit anxious, and I can sometimes feed into them but I do my best to accept and welcome them and back into this weird void I go. And I enjoy it. It's something magically relaxing and somewhat idk emotional or informational? Idk if this is something that is supposed to happen or if other people feel this as well but I just wanted to share my experience with everyone. Because honestly it feels amazing. And terrifying.

"Yesterday I went to a local Buddhist meditation group after a few months of not attending. I have been struggling a bit mentally, and decided to go as I didn't have that much going on. Honestly it was more for the community aspect than the teachings. Everyone there has at least 30 years on me, so I get a cool perspective.

Anyway after the meditation when I open my eyes my ears started ringing very loudly and my vision fogged up. It was similar to a head rush (I get them a lot) but I was sitting down the whole time. I had just drank 2 glasses of water so I knew it wasn't dehydration. It didn't come with any alternative thoughts or feelings that stood out, which has happened to me with before. The ear ringing was extremely loud, louder than everyone in the room. I've also been having a ton of ear ringing in general. 

I went over to my friends house after the and gave his mom a hug. She said ""You are sad, why are you sad?""

I sorta just laughed it off and said ""I didn't know I was sad."" I had a dream a while back where my girlfriend told me that I have a big ball of sadness, and this reminded me of it. But compared to how my mood has been the past few weeks I was in a good mood. 

Anyway that is just some background information, my main reason for posting this is to get some different opinions on this ringing and dizziness. I don't know what to think of it. Thanks",0

*“Prem” is a Hindi word which means “Love” and the meaning of “ Nida “ is Nest. So,* ***Osho Prem Nida****is like a nest that nurtures love &amp;joy, nourishes the soul &amp; rejuvenates the body.*  *It is a place of* divine potential for sentient experience, ultimate happiness, and deep contentment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Location** \- 

 Osho Prem Nida, an ashram in the lap of nature, is located in the village Daluwala within limits of Rajaji Nation Park between Roorkee &amp; Haridwar ( Uttrakhand). Amidst the greenery &amp; jungle, the ashram is spread over 32 acres.OshoPremNida was inaugurated on 25 July 2010 on the day of Gurupurnima and the wilderness of nature has been preserved while designing the ashram.

&amp;#x200B;

**Natural Beauty-**

The ashram is surrounded by Shivalik ranges. The serene environment of the ashram has calmness of the trees, the fragrance of flowers, chirping of birds and whistling winds. During clear nights its seems that stars are bestowing all their coolness on the Ashram. Proximity to Ganga also provides a lot of spiritual energy which helps in meditation energizing mind and body. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Nature heals and soothes-**

  

Being in nature reduces anger, fear, depression, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only provides better emotional strength, but it also contributes to the physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones. In the long run, it reduces mortality.

***""Nature is fuel for the soul, ""*** says Richard Ryan

&amp;#x200B;

**Meditation in Nature -** 

 The abundance of positive energy in nature removes negativity from the mind &amp; body. The awareness of natural beauty is a step towards egolessness.  Raw greenery, Bamboo trees, wildflowers bring the calmness of thoughts and revitalizes the body- such undisturbed wilderness makes it a perfect getaway for mystical experiences.

Meditating in nature is not just good for mind, body &amp; soul it is also good for plants &amp; animals. They are more healthy and peaceful. 

It has been experienced by Mahavir- “***By meditating in nature we connect, pray and communicate with trees , plants, animals, birds, crystal &amp; water, etc.”***

The proximity of the river Ganga also brings divine effect. The sound of water also has a tranquilizing effect on the mind. Ganga has been considered sacred for the very simple reason that the meditation has been done by many saints on the banks of this holy river. The water gets energized due to the power of meditation and drinking that water makes us peaceful.

Water molecules react differently on being exposed to positive or negative thoughts, so we can appreciate the fact that as our bodies are 70% water our thoughts and emotion will play a big role in our health and wellbeing.",0
"I’ve been trying to practice meditation, and I’m finding it to be extremely frustrating as opposed to calming. I try to focus on something such as my breathing and to just allow thoughts to enter and leave without paying much attention, but my mind just becomes agitated and unable to focus. It feels impossible for me to make any progress, and if anything, my failing to do so just  increase negative feelings. I’m not doing this to find or obtain anything, just to sit and breathe and be present, but I cannot for the life of me practice anything remotely close to that. 

I deal with a lot of anxiety and irritability, so I could certainly benefit from the practice, but it feels like I don’t have the capability to do so, which only serves to amplify the anxiety/irritability. I usually feel worse after trying to meditate than before.",0

"Hello. I consider myself very lucky to live near the beach. I try my best to walk on the beach to observe, listen, meditate and stretch a few times a week. Lately I’ve been pausing and watching more particularly at sunset or early in the morning calm. I started recording the landscapes to watch and listen to them in my free time. They help me relax during breaks at work or go to sleep. It’s simple, I just capture the stillness of the moment and the waves/ landscape are perfect white noise to ease the mind. I put the videos online, don’t think it’s for everyone - but maybe it’ll help y’all find stillness.

I'm new to meditation practice (a few weeks), but I have been meditating most evenings before bed and have been able to really reach a meditative state for at least part of the meditation. It's a pretty awesome feeling and im keen to continue and build on my practice. 

Last night I listened to a guided healing mediation by Michael Sealey on YouTube. I listened to it with headphones in, because my partner was sleeping next to me and didn't feel like meditating. I fell asleep before the meditation ended. 

I had the most intense, visual dream of my ex boyfriend. We dated for 5 years, from age 19-24 (relevant). In my dream we were reconnecting and talking about what has happened in each other's life since we broke up. We hugged very intensely and I told him about my life. It was amiable.  Note that I have zero contact with my ex, he lives across the country now and we don't have each other on social media. 

While my current partner is at work he texts me ""I had a really weird dream about your ex boyfriend. I was having visions of you except younger, with black hair and kinda emo. You guys were hugging and I felt sad and jealous in the dream"". It's true that I did look ""kind of emo"" in my early 20s (and had black hair), and he hasn't seen many pictures of me from that time. 

I have to note that my current partner and I live in Ontario, and I grew up in Alberta (where my ex lives). There's zero chance that my partner has seen photos of my ex or has mutual friends etc. He's not someone I talk about a lot so it is random for him to have a dream of him. 

Is this a phenomenon that anyone is familiar with?  

I never forgave my ex for a lot of things that he did to me (infidelity, lying, manipulation).  I feel that my repressed subconscious wants me to forgive him. Tips? Thoughts? Opinions? Have you experienced something similar?",0
How do you end your meditations? I've been meditating for about a month and find that I get particularly anxious about meditating beyond the time I've set aside. Using a standard timer is harsh and quite unpleasant but I need some way of trusting that I'm going to reengage with the world at am appropriate time. Suggestions?,0
So right now I meditate 25 minutes in the morning and 25 before bed.  My dilemma is that I’m not very consistent meditating in the evening.  Would meditating 50 minutes in the morning be better if it means I’m more consistent? And would jumping from 25 minutes to 50 minutes be too much?,0
"Since I meditated yesterday I see a massive crack over my vision  that consist of colors that change rapidly, when I focus on it it just goes a bit more to the left and shortly after focusing it goes back to the middle. It's fascinating but really annoying. I can't really see what I am writing because that crack is going over the letters I am typing. It just appeared 14 hours after meditating while I was on my phone.",0

"Hello /r/meditation,

I'm looking for guided imagery or other meditative practice that would focus on cultivating and experiencing an emotion.

I know an example of such guided imagery where you have a trigger that would make you build the emotion up, and then you let it go as soon as the trigger is no more there.

I would love to learn about similar techniques if anybody can advise on it",0

"I’ve been trying to meditate on and off for around two years, never getting further than a streak of a week or two of daily practice. I’m currently using the Headspace app, even though I find the narrator’s voice unpleasant, because at least it’s very simple.  
 
Everything I read and hear about meditation seems to say the easiest place to start is to focus on your breathing. I don’t under how to do this, though. I can’t focus on something with no words. As in, if I’m trying to put my focus onto my breathing, or for that matter instrumental music or something visual, my inner monologue is still running. Not always in a bad way, but obviously it’s not great when trying to meditate. The Headspace instructions talk about “observing your thoughts and letting them go” but although I can consciously think “that was a thought, I don’t need to dwell on it,” my brain moves on to a different thought, rather than to even a second of wordlessness. I don’t know how my brain can even exist without words to be honest - there isn’t a second of my life where words aren’t going through my mind. 

I’m not spiritual, so mantras don’t appeal to me (I’m also not a fan of affirmations), and have quite bad anxiety; the aim is to get to a point where I don’t overthink so much and can more easily distance myself from what I worry about.",0
"Hi guys, I am going to start going on the path of enlightenment. I just need to ask a few questions before I get started. 

I have ADHD, would that make meditation more harder for me? 

Does being on medication for ADHD like adderall bad or good for your path of enlightenment? 

Do you breath in through your nose and out of your mouth?

I have hearing aids, so when I'm not wearing them I can barely like hear anything. So I was wondering if I should meditate in silence or do it while listening to meditation musics?

I'm also wondering if there is any other sites or music that can help me tune into the universal energies more and more. 

And one last thing, I used to smoke weed daily but now its occasionally. Does weed messes up your enlightenment? And is it okay to meditate when you're high?

Thank you, any help is greatly appreciated.

Im also going to meditate while lying down since I find it more comfortable.",0
"I had a really rough day today. Don't need to get into it but work was a bitch and my personal life threw a curveball at me.

I got home feeling angry and frustrated, and normally my go-to stress reliever is weed (see username) but instead I decided to take a different approach.

Now I'm no stranger to meditation, and I actually try and do it every day, and have been for a decent chunk of time now. But I've only recently actually tried to apply the Wim Hof breathing method into my arsenal as well. Never tried the cold shower part before though.

I tried the cold shower today, and let me tell you it was the greatest damn shower I've ever taken. I hate the cold. I suck it up because there's no reason to complain about it, but I still hate it.

For me to be able to step into a freezing cold shower and go from ""OHMYGODTHISFUCKINGSUCKS"" to ""you know, I like this a lot"" in less than 30 seconds is nothing short of a miracle. I finished my shower and stepped out feeling like a new man. 

I can't believe how long it has taken me to finally try this, but now I'm going to do everything I can to incorporate the shower into my daily routine as well. I feel as good and confident now as I really ever do, not to mention the health benefits associated with taking colder showers. 

TL;DR - Cold shower made me happy instead of more angry.",0

"Hi everyone!

I have dabbled on and off over the years with meditation and recently I have found new level of awareness and commitment to the practice.  (for me it's been the app headspace that's helped tremendously, something about it just clicks for me)

I am on a one week streak and want to keep at it.  But one thing derails me a little bit at times.... My cats.  I love them so much! They've been a great help in the past when struggling with depression.  They're always there to rub against me, fwop on my lap, one even drools when I give him big pets.  

I recently realized they're a great practice in being mindful, they bring my awareness to the moment and help keep my mind clear when distracted with anxious thoughts.  However, sometimes when meditating, they become the distraction.  I do my best to include their presence as a part of my meditation (being aware of my surroundings) .  But there are days when I just don't want to be physically disturbed when meditating.  These cats are very Codependent, and when given the opportunity to lay on my lap, they take it. 

I am still in the swing of things of relearning awareness, letting thoughts pass, letting go of distraction.  I have tried isolating myself in my bedroom... But they scratch at the door and meow for me to let them in.  Often my only solution is to give in to their needs, give them the attention they seek, and wait for them to calm down and nap next to me. I do this so I feel as though I will be free to meditate with minimal disturbances.  The time I spend with them beforehand is used as practice to be mindful, and help calm my often racing mind. I have had success with this, but it can sometimes feel as a time sink, and I am struggling with not letting these thoughts become obsessive. 

Have anyone else here shared similar experiences with pets? How have you coped with the extra distraction of your beloved partners? I would love to get some extra insight on the topic.",0
"I’ve been doing meditation on and off for the past 2 years. Today during my practice I found a very entertaining way to stay focused on the breath.

I would picture myself sitting in the center of the universe, then as I breathed in I watched all of the stars and planets get sucked into my body. After this, all I could see was white. I would hold the universe in my lungs for a bit, then exhale and watch the planets &amp; stars come shooting back out. I would take a second to look around the beautiful universe I created and was apart of, then inhale again. 

Over and over I watched the destruction and construction of my own solar system as I breathed in and out. 

It really made me feel at peace &amp; made me feel as if I were really outside of the entire universe. I was there alone with just my body and breath, quite an amazing feeling :) 

Let me know what you guys do/if you found this helpful! Have a good day &amp; stay mindful!",0

"I have a problem. Most times, when i focus on my breath, i have the same problem. I see but mostly hear things, in basiclly the same way as in dreams. They are very random, and i am not thinking activly. When i have them i have to options:
1.Observe them and see where they are going. This has allways resultet with me falling asleep
2. Focus very hard on my breath. This feels like waking up, but it only lasts around 5 sekunds, before those ""thoughts"" return. This also very exhausting since it is just like fighting falling asleep, even if it is alot slower, compared to times where i am just tired.

I know the solution is easy: just keep my eyes open.
But i really enjoy meditating with my eyes closed.(when i don't have these thoughts)

So that is why i am asking you, if you have had any similar experiences or maybe even know what i am talking about.
Or if you don't, i would really appreaciate it, if you could share your experiences. Or if you would advise me to keep on ""fighting"" those ""thoughts"" or if i should follow them, to maybe find there roots.

Also: I get enough sleep(around 7.30-9h) each night. But i do feel tired quite often.

Thank you in advance.",0
"[Correct vs Incorrect posture](https://i.imgur.com/avf9M8m.jpg)

&gt;""The posture without excessive lordosis (right picture) is indeed healthier for the spine...less prone long-term to disc herniation and other issues. But in terms of zazen, someone sitting with pelvis tilted and back curved as in the left photo cannot breathe deeply at all...the diaphragm cannot move freely and fully. This means that the method of breath cultivation that is foundational in Rinzai practice, and upon which cultivation of profound samadhi and the ability to bodily work with practice methods like koan/wato depends, will be impossible.""  ~Roshi Meido Moore

Of course that is from a Rinzai zen perspective, but the physical effects with a posture like that are universal. The diaphragm will not move freely and you will wind up with a sore back or worse. 

Some people like to claim posture isn't important. Well, it is important if you don't want back pain!",0
"I've seen a few people in this thread saying that there feelings of anxiety worsen when meditating. I've just come across this article, that some people may find interesting or an answer.

"I was meditating during my train ride when I realized something that I'd consider very important. You need white to have black and you need black to have white. A white painting on a white background is just white and not a painting, just like a black painting on a black background is just black and not a painting. To have a painting you need at least both of those.

I've noticed during the my meditation on my train ride that my awareness is the same. When I focus on something I also focus on nothing. It's paradoxical, but it's the way my awareness works. Focus on one thing and you'll find yourself focusing on nothing. Focus on nothing and you'll find yourself focusing on something. If I try to focus on something it won't work, it seems that I either have to jump to something else or nothing at all. The same happens when I try to focus on nothing, it doesn't work. I jump back to something. But interestingly enough if I start observing both my focus on something and nothing I can maintain it. 

So what does this teach me? Perhaps that it's impossible to ever focus on only emptiness itself? Perhaps it's impossible to ever focus on only something? Perhaps I should try focusing on something and at the same on nothing at all, doing the illogical and paradoxical.",0
"Stillness is defined by a lack of movement. What is calm and still in nature moves slowly or not at all, with a vastness and consistency that humbles as much as it inspires. I look at the stolid dependability of a tree or a boulder and remember that we have much to learn about life from these objects that we write off as lifeless.

As soon as you begin to focus on an object with a certain benign indifference, you’ll find life in it. Everything is charged with some sort of energy. I don’t mean this in a hippie dippie acid dream sense, but instead in a simple perceptual sense. The energy of a given external stimulus is determined by how you judge it. If you train your attention to be neutral, you uncover unforeseen opportunities and begin to see nuances.

Meditation practice challenges us to find this stillness. By willfully exposing ourselves to a lack of movement, we grant ourselves permission to tune into the spontaneous stillness of nature. Finding the stillness is much like zoning in to a special frequency. Most of the time we’re tuned to a loud and chaotic frequency full of ambitions, desires, judgments and anxieties, but a frequency of meditative stillness exists pervasively beneath all of this. Like darkness, it precedes light. It floats under what we perceive to be reality, and as a result it often reflects deeper truths than what we see on the surface.

My mind always tries to throw off the stillness. This is the specialty of the human; it arrogantly and naively attempts to assert its own subjectivity on an objective and uncaring whole. Nature is the substructure, human projection the superstructure. We build an artificial reality on top of a natural reality that already exists, and thus over time the layers thicken and we become less aware of true reality. Meditation is a truly revelatory act in these times; it helps us slowly return to these natural depths and contemplate what true being is. This is a practice that society as a whole has long forgotten. Reviving it is key to our survival and humility as a species.

"Let me just start by saying I stopped consuming the news a long time ago and am no longer personally on social media, but sometimes certain news stories make it back to me. Sometimes I can't help reading more when something really strikes fear in me but that's rare. When it does happen though, I'm literally unable to take myself out of swimming in those icky feelings for an uncomfortable amount of time.

When I hear something disturbing or depressing it can make me feel super down for hours to days in a way that many of my ""local"" thoughts don't. Especially things that evoke fear (like mass shootings) or  or something just depressing (like the opioid epidemic) or gross excerpts (like reading about an incel who tweeted an extremely sexually derogatory thing about women) - all these tend to make me fearful of the world or wary about other people. The latter is a stronger emotion. It does make the world seem like a truly dark and gross place for a while.

I try to distract myself, if I have the time, by watching/reading about good people and positive things in the world. It doesn't necessarily work. These thoughts in particular are really sticky and take a long time to unstick. While I'm trying to unstick from these thoughts, or if i don't have the time and have to power through a task, my day takes on a totally different mood. I'm aware of what's happening, but I can't see it and disengage with it as I can with other thoughts. These thoughts make me fearful of the people that are around since, for some unfounded reason, I never thought people like the people in the news actually existed before the internet/social media really took over. I'm not saying I'm perfect, just that I am perhaps naive and sheltered, but learning about negative reality doesn't make me happier *or*, more importantly, more effective at helping.

I've been meditating 2-3x for 2 years and it's still something I can't seem to  be fully aware of, or have the choice to disengage with. What can I do to deal with this?",0
"I already meditate for a clear mind, but can I also enhance my body?",0
"It has been 24 days since I broke up with my ex. It has been hard for me. After a meditation session today, I began to feel a deep sadness in my heart. I realized that it was more than I had been feeling before this. I realized that instead of slowing down to properly feel my emotions, I was going fast and distracting myself with everything I could after the breakup.

Now, more than three weeks after, it all released. I was on a walk when, stemming from the sadness I was feeling, sobs began to overcome me. It was the first time I truly felt the grief of loss after I broke up with her... So I let myself cry. I let it all out. I didn't hold back. Waves of emotion passed through me, and I cried hard. I sat there and felt it all.

After that, I felt a little bit better. I can only hope that this experience and hardship will one day have me coming out the other end a stronger person. It's amazing how meditation can allow us to look into ourselves and release what needs to be released. Because in order to move on, you have to feel all the emotions you want to avoid.

Just wanted to share my experience. Thanks for reading.",0

"Hello!

So I've been meditating for some time and have been doing it in various ways. Now as I'm learning about posture and my goal is to train myself to sit in a seated meditation for hours on end without having a hard time physically.

Whwt do I mean by that? Whenever I meditate, my legs in cross legged posture go numb after 20min. Also when I do that posture, my right side of the back is doing all the work to hold the posture.

Any suggestions how can I train my left and right back imbalances? And maybe tips for current meditation daily practice that would alleviate the load and I'd be able to sit for 40mins or even longer?",0
"I have been meditating quite successfully for about 2 years now. Simple mindfulness meditation, concentrating on the breath, acknowledging thoughts and letting them go. I use it to calm my mind and, through that, to relax my muscles which tense up whenever my thoughts are too many and too chaotic. With that, I have a very reliable sign and meter for my mental well being - if I meditate enough, I can be almost relaxed; if I don't, things get tense and painful.

Now for my question: After about 15 minutes there often is a moment when I forget to watch my breath and thoughts and get swept away in some daydream. When this happens, it is accompanied by a peaceful feeling, a calm mind (not empty though) and a noticeable relaxation of the muscles.

I enjoy this a lot. But isn't this kinda the opposite of what we are trying to achieve when focusing on the breath and letting thoughts pass in order to have fewer of them?

In the first 10 minutes I would actively recognize upcoming thoughts, label them, return to my breath. While this in itself feels good, it also feels a bit like work. I'm still doing something, focusing. And then the real freedom seems to come only when I fail in being mindful?

What do you all think of that?",0
"I think this is a relevant sub to post this question in. 

There's this common problem that a lot of people have. They might enjoy an activity or hobby.......however after a certain point, it starts to become a drag. The point can vary from people to people. Some people don't even have a point if the hobby in question is their number one passion. However for most activities and most people, this point exist. Especially if its something that requires long hours of work like Animation or programming. They don't necessarily hate the activity after going beyond this point, but they lose motivation and that spark that makes the activity really fun. It becomes monotonous after this point. 

I have this problem with this animation. When I started it as a hobby, I used to love it. Used to spend hours every day working on my own projects. But then when I pursued it further at university and it became more of a job to me......that's when it lost its spark. Felt like a drag. I still feel motivation from time to time but its not as exciting as it was before when it was a hobby. 

This is a mental thing. When it was a hobby, I chose to do it. When it became like a job, I was forced to do it. So even though I was doing the exact same thing and spending the same number of hours, the motivation depended on what context I was working in. So I know this is all in the head, and nothing else. 

Is it possible to use the same philosophies used in meditation to make yourself voluntarily enjoy an activity even though it seems like a drag? How do you make your mind do it? Whenever I enjoy my work, the quality of it improves, so enjoyment is very important.",0
"So after a bad break up from a long term relationship (14-19)  I have been meditating every day using headspace for about 70 days. 

I'm finding that being in a mindful state and letting thoughts pass me by and focusing in the moment just leaves me with a sort of sad aftertaste or tone to my life and is quite easy to still react negatively to some troubling persistent thoughts. And these thoughts are almost always there. 

Whereas recently, I have been adopting the 'fuck thinking or caring about that' mentality and it seems to be working in terms of im not getting sad anymore and its more mild anger which is directed at work and actually makes me work harder. ( I work in house removals so the anger rush gets taken out on me carrying boxes upstairs fast lol and is followed by a sense of relief and joy)

I really want to stay with the meditation journey and be filled with gratitude and compassion whilst letting thoughts go BUT im thinking a sort of anger mentality is more effective right now? I'm interested to know what anyone thinks, thanks.",0
"I've been reading Alan Watts recently, and he makes this beautiful point about concentration, and that to not debate the nature of why you're concentrating or whether you're concentrating or not, but to just do it.

I applied that for the first time today, it was something I was already beginning to understand, and then today, though not for long, there were times where it was pure consciousness, pure concentration. It would last a maximum of like five seconds and then my mind would go 'this is great' and hence ruin the whole thing. But I'm not disheartened by that. I know where I'm going with this now. 

It's weird. What I'd thought meditation was has now changed, but for the better. It's actually really so painfully simple conceptually, and it's actually this over simplicity which makes things hard. All meditation requires is to simply 'be'. That's it. Don't think about whether you're sat in the right position, or whether you're doing it for long enough, or any of those things. Just be. Relax, breathe naturally and don't complicate things.

I meditated for half an hour today, and that's my new personal record. I hate to turn it into an achievement because ultimately that's not the end goal, about doing it for longer. What matters is that I feel as if it's not as hard as I thought it was now. When I started out meditating, I was putting so much pressure on myself and ultimately my ego would always bounce back when things weren't going my way and I would just give up because eventually what I'd think is, 'oh ffs this isn't working there's no point.' Part of the beauty is to actually explore that. Recognising that you are finding it difficult and getting back to just 'being'. 

I'm sure there will be a lot of experts who might see this as basic shit or even think I'm not doing it properly, but I write this for beginners like myself to persevere and to not put pressure on themselves. Even if you have a session where your ego is louder than normal and you can't seem to concentrate for one second, stick with it. You're building resistance through becoming the observer, and if you are like me, it will become easier with time.",0
"Until about 2-3 weeks ago i was in one of the worst depressive episodes of my life (lasted almost all summer). I started meditating again mid last month. I didn’t really notice anything until today when I was in the car and noticed how happy I was. Or how calm I was. Or how I don’t spiral when something goes wrong. And it just kind of happened... I don’t know when in the last 2-3 weeks it happened but it did.

My one advice for everyone is to stop constantly checking your progress. Keep meditating and one day hopefully you too will be in the middle of an errand and just realize how different life suddenly is.",0
"Was watching Sam Harris talk to the minimalists today. He said that if he had to give a pithy answer about living a meaningful life and keeping suffering to a minimum then it would be that ""when you're suffering you're lost in thought.""

It's no secret that most of us spend most of our lives lost in thought, though for people with OCD I would suspect it's even worse. Intrusive thoughts can come in at any time and spoil any ""presence"" one is lucky enough to stumble across at any given moment. 

I'm not going to beat around the bush here, I'm very depressed and anxious and suicidal and life for me is generally quite painful. Mostly due to internal rather than external circumstances. I have a good life, family etc. My job makes me pretty miserable in fairness but I'm fairly confident most of my problems are due to my state of mind. 

I do meditate for ten minutes every day, I have been since late last year and I'm tempted to say it has been helping somewhat, though as this post indicates it's clearly not enough on its own. 

I'm gonna go get some therapy in an attempt to try and make life less painful. Lately, I've often been waking up with morning anxiety and morning sickness (dry heaving, unable to eat). Occasionally my first thought, when I wake up, is ""your parents are going to die one day"", and that sends my head into a spin. 

Why do I have to worry about things I can't control, things that haven't happened yet. There's no utility in this worry whatsoever. It's just pointless. 

Anyway, as I said I'm gonna go and get some CBT in an effort to combat this. I'm almost afraid to honestly because I've had my hopes raised and destroyed so many times that I'm afraid of feeling that again because it's awful and fills me with the deepest despair. 

I suppose the point of this post is to ask, how feasible is it for a person with OCD to reach a state of mindfulness with only meditation in their psychological toolkit or is much more needed just to get you through one's life. I've tried medication and I'm not a fan. CBT is the only thing I've never really committed to. 

Because ultimately, if it's difficult for a regular person to reduce the quantity of though interrupting the present moment then for a person with OCD it must be ultra-hard. And I'm not sure I can cope anymore.

"I had a very emotionally stressful weekend that triggered a lot of my past troubles and made my anxiety flare up really bad. Last night I laid in bed meditating asking for my spirit guides and guardian angels to come and help guide me. Guide me to my right path and to help me release any negative energy, thoughts, or fears that were keeping me from my truth. I felt tears drop as I was thinking these things and I believed them with all sincerity. As I was continuing my request. My eyes, which were closed, went from seeing darkness to a bright sky blue. Not as if there was a light in my room, that’s just the color it changed too. Then I heard, not with my ears, but in my mind another thought other than mine that said, “ I am Mother Mary.” Right at that moment I felt a huge sense of relief, like an end to my sadness. I felt comforted and calmed, and I started singing “Let It Be” by The Beatles in my mind out of nowhere. My meditation was disrupted by my neighbors and I came out of it. I know I wasn’t asleep yet because I am aware of all my thoughts and sounds around me. I laid there for a few minutes trying to process what had just happened. I still can’t figure it out.

I judge more often, become reactive. I know I should not be doing it, at least I am aware of ego doing that. I feels like I am going backwards and my ego is dominating me more than before. There are so many ideas and concept in my head, my mind always try to reach a conclusion from them to justify my action. I felt a huge shift in my motivation, level of happiness, satisfaction in the beginning of this year. I accomplished things which I never thought  I could do. I felt good all time like being high 24/7. I felt real joy and fullfuillment. Suddenly it all stopped. Everything started to seem meaningless, depressing. The self improving, spiritual ideas don’t interest me anymore. Nothing feels real anymore. I feel like a negative fearful energy always trapped inside me. I crave for that lost good feeling I used to feel. I always keep searching in my head what was that idea that triggered the transformation.  Why am i not progressing anymore? Should I increase the duration of meditation or follow any different technique? How do I stop this downward spiral of depression and self judgement?",0
"I started to like her last year during our high school dance lessons, then it developed to a slight crush for the rest of the past school year. Summer break seemed to diminish my crush on her. Then I started my meditation and NoFap journey. Everything looked fine.

During the past few weeks, I noticed that I still have feelings for her, this time (maybe because of meditation etc.) it feels much stronger. When I have nothing else to do, I can't stop thinking about her.

I haven't told her, I decided that will dedicate the rest of this year to meditation and celibacy. Because I think I need to work on my self esteem, confidence and school duties first, and meditation seems to be very helpful.

My question is: How to deal with such intense emotions, noticing them and reminding myself that it will pass, barely seems to affect them.",0

"Hi all! 

I’m somewhat new to the community and I’ve been inspired to get into meditating more seriously. So far I’ve really only done it as a component of a yoga class or way to fall asleep, but I’d like to pick it up as a daily habit. Since I’m so new I’d like to start with guided meditations to help me stay on track and learn how to meditate better. 

I’m looking specifically for improved focus and more self control- I feel like I’m lacking in my ability to control my brain from just autopiloting to social media (yeah, the irony of this post is not lost on me), I’m not as good about saying no to sweets as I should be, and I just generally have a hard time with my attention span and focus. I would just like to generally improve those areas!

Can you recommend some specific apps/courses/videos that may have helped you in these arenas? I’ve checked out insight timer a bit and would love a specific course/session recommendation.  Thanks!",0

"I've found Sam Harris's Waking Up app to be very helpful in learning how to meditate. This is partly because Sam goes so far out of his way to avoid anything that might even get close to bordering on belief. But as I get a little more comfortable with the practice, and listen to other well known figures like Ram Dass (who unlike Sam talks enthusiastically and with apparent sincerity about Hindu gods like Hanuman), I find myself getting more and more curious about the religious underpinnings of the practice. At the same time, I'm a typical western secularist and wouldn't have much ability to tolerate blatant proselytizing. Does anyone have any recommendations for good sources on Hindu or Buddhist belief that sort of fit into that niche of taking the belief seriously without trying to convert you?",0
"My task is to stop berating myself when I make mistakes.

I don’t need to feel any shame for my actions that are performed with good intentions. I just need to take note of how I can modify my behavior, and try my best to implement that behavior.

I do not intend to inconvenience or confuse people. Sometimes I go on autopilot and get lost in thought, and I make mistakes because of it. THIS IS THE STAGE I AM IN. I don’t need to hate myself for this. What I need to do is continue to work toward good mental and physical health, and peacefulness.

I failed to deal with some painful losses in my life in a healthy way, so I turned to alcohol for about a year. This is the main reason I lack mental clarity. Now that I’m sober and getting healthier physically, mentally, and emotionally, I know my life is going to get easier and simple tasks aren’t going to feel like such a burden. So right now, my task is to trust that all is coming in time and practice, and I shouldn’t hate myself for the stage I’m at, even though I'm not satisfied with it. I can hold onto that dissatisfaction with myself lovingly. Deep down, I love myself, so I want to be healthy and have great mental clarity.

I don't think people choose to become addicts. No one wants that. Many people are ignorant of how addictions form, and they're egotistical thinking that they are above chemical dependency. That ego has to come from somewhere, I don't even think we choose to have big egos or choose to be arrogant/selfish/etc..

There was no buddhism, no yoga or meditation teacher, no therapist in my world growing up. I became conditioned to respond to things a certain way, and while I did use my will to make lots of choices that shaped who I am, I was only presented with so many options for how I was going to respond to the world. I often felt forced to go along with things and do what was expected of me by my parents and friends.

Because literally ALL of my friends in the neighborhood were homophobic, (white suburb in Southern U.S.) I felt like I had no choice but to be too, so for a few years when I was about 8-12, I made very hateful ""jokes"" about gay people just to be included. I wasn't strong enough to choose to stand up to my friends, which is too bad, but should I hate myself for it? I have to believe that hateful people, egomaniacs and addicts deserve love too. I can't just hate myself forever, even though I now view things like homophobia as one of the worst traits a human being can possibly have. I might have been a brat, but I wasn't evil. I was just scared of being rejected by my friends. It may not have even occurred to me that being gay could possibly be anything other than wrong. That was just the reality I was presented with.

In general, I highly doubt people are gonna harm themselves with alcohol or anything else if they're emotionally well-adjusted and happy- I don't know yet what the ""root cause"" is that makes alcohol feel so good to me, all I know is that I've always had anxiety even since I was around middle school age (24 now), and alcohol has always taken it away.

I am going to manage my anxiety and stay sober. And I know that you are going to achieve whatever sort of peacefulness you are searching for too &lt;3 Thanks for reading my emotionally-charged ranting :D",0
"Hi all!

We all know that it can be hard to start and maintain a regular sitting practice. So I wondered if anyone would care to join me in a daily meditation challenge for October?

I've set up a monthly meditation challenge for the last eighteen months, and it's really seemed to strike a chord here and received lots of engagement and positive feedback over that time. I stuck to daily meditation throughout much of that time myself (struggled a little some months, but I do have a two year old son at the moment!), and many others who took part have managed consistent practice throughout that time. It provided a lovely sense of community and lots of encouragement.

So, here's the deal:

You choose how much time you want to spend meditating each day, and what sort of meditation you're going to practice. But you commit to practicing every day for the month of October, and maybe check in on here with others who are doing the same. The idea is to have some group support/accountability, to help you stick to daily practice all month long.

If it goes well, then we rinse and repeat for the month of November. I'll make a new post for that when the time comes.

Post a comment below if you'd like to take part. And if you'd like an accountability partner to really help see you through your daily practice, post a comment below that says ""accountability partner needed"". Then wait for someone else to reply to your comment, and say ""I'll be your partner"". You can help keep each other in check throughout the month.

For those who use Insight Timer, there is a group for this called Meditation Month. Feel free to join up and find some extra accountability there.

For those who use it, there is also a discord server for this. I won't be over there myself, but if you want to join the url is https://discord.gg/afyEk32 - thanks to /u/3DimenZ for setting it up.

Good luck folks. Hope this helps some of you start a meditation habit and others get back into one.

TLDR: Encouragement and support for people trying to make daily meditation stick!

NOTE: I like to encourage everyone who wants to take part and who leaves a comment below by wishing them luck and other little things in response. But I don't reply to people who have asked for an accountability partner in their comment because I don't want them to get a little ""new message"" icon and get hopeful only to find it's me saying ""good luck!"", and also because I think people scanning comments to see if anyone needs a partner might more easily look past those that already have a reply, even if the reply is just from me and isn't actually an offer to be a partner. Just wanted to let those folks who don't get a reply from me know that it's nothing personal! I wish you luck too, and am pleased you're taking part! :)

NOTE 2: Since starting these monthly challenges, the Insight Timer group has grown to 900+ members, and the Discord even more than that! So join in and help make meditation a regular part of your life!

I feel great. Actually.

But I'm also spinning off the planet. I would like to get grounded.

It's not one of those experiences I've had where I'm spinning of into a world of metaphysical Ideas.

Something within me wants out. It's a brilliant light in my chest. Invincible, indestructible.

Maybe I don't need to do anything. Maybe 

Just.

Allow. It's all part of the experience that's happening.

Who am I, Really? The cosmic web of interbeing, that's me. And you. Oh it's all soo true. Yea a man.

Jesus man calm the fuck down. It's just some kinda increased awareness thing happening, Or conciosusness. I don't know how to differentiate between the two.

"I just started meditating this week, but I've found meditating to be really helpful for my anxiety and work productivity.  When my mind would normally run off through stressful fantasy scenarios and worries I've been able to catch it and recenter my focus on either my breath or what I'm doing.  Sleeping was really really difficult for me because my mind would race even faster, thinking about and imagining anything and everything.  I've been using the same techniques to help me sleep at night and it works, my mind still wants to take off but I try not to let thoughts get carried away and I've been able to sleep (so far) a 24h 30m cycle whereas before I was on maybe a 30h cycle roughly, depending on the day.  Still have to get better at the waking up part to actually keep 24 hours lol.

So the part this is all leading up to.  Ever since I started this, my dreams have been *really* vivid, on the level of my most vivid dreams and it's every night.  I'm also waking up multiple times throughout the night, however I don't know if that's new or if I'm just noticing it now but that's also every night, usually once in the middle of the night and once around sunrise.  I guess it's not a huge issue, but I wake up every morning feeling like I got woken up from really deep sleep, and while the dreams aren't nightmares or stressful it's still weird having them be so intense consistently.",0
"Hello all,

I’m currently studying abroad and taking some time in solitude to do a little introspection. I’ve practiced meditation inconsistently for years, but for the last 6 weeks I’ve been going at it twice a day and I feel amazing.

I write to you all because I’ve recently noticed the lack of control my significant other has over her emotions. I’ve always been the more level headed one in the relationship, and I try not to let her mood effect mine (a difficult task I find myself struggling with, but one I’m getting better at through my practice).

Furthermore, I’ve tried to explain the benefits of practice but she hasn’t taken to it. I’m nearing the end of my college career and we will soon be discussing whether we should end it as a college fling, or make an effort to stay together. I’m not here to ask for relationship advice, instead I’m curious if anyone has any input based on their current/past relationships.

Does your significant other practice meditation? If not, do you find yourself bothered by their lack of emotional understanding/insight which you’ve gained through your practice? Am I looking at this the wrong way, and should instead learn to accept her mood as external and focus on my internal sense of calm?

Any and all responses would be appreciated :)",0
"Most people experience thoughts verbally. Fewer people are aware of the conceptual structure of thought. It's actually possible to experience the concept without the verbal thought that arises.

Very few people are aware that emotions are the carrier wave of thought. It's possible to develop an awareness that discerns the concept, the verbalization, and the underlying emotional tone of thought.

Generally speaking, if you have a thought, particularly one you have identified with, then that thought is always carried by emotional current. Ordinary thought, for the vast majority of people, is never truly rational.

Since these emotions are carrier waves of thought and concepts, there is a kind of negotiation that takes place in your mind and body. What may seem conceptually illogical to other people feels logical to yourself, because the way two thoughts link together are carried by the same emotional current, or have resonance.

Thoughts that seem irrational has more to do with thoughts carried by dissonant emotional current, than it does with concepts that are actually logical.

When an emotional current that carries a thought is unpleasant, people try not to think about that thought. That is experienced anywhere from that nagging itch in your subconscious, to violent emotions that lead to personal attacks to other people, to outright ignorance where the person literally blocks it out of their mind. These are aversions.

When an emotional current carries a thought that is pleasant, people try to cling on to it. These are graspings. Grasping is part of how we form identities around thoughts. These thoughts come in the form of, ""I am ..."". For example, careers (""I am a scientist"", ""I am a mechanic"", ""I am a software engineer""), group memberships (""I am a Quoran""), nationalism (""I am American""), racial identity (""I am Asian""), gender identity (""I am male"", ""I am female"", ""I am transgendered""). We do this to form various stories or narratives about our lives (""I am a good person"", ""I am persecuted"", ""I am a hero-entrepreneur"", ""I am a hacker living at the edge of the law"").

Sometimes the emotional current, driven by the carrot (graspings) and stick (aversions), often time leads thought patterns into a loop. It's not that there is a logical loop, it's that the emotional current that carries those thoughts goes in loops.

There is no way to logic your way out of these kinds of loops, or truly validate your own thoughts. That's because, in order to use logic, the way most people use it, requires an emotional current to carry thoughts. The typical emotional current someone uses to logic their way out of things is forms of self-judgement, denial, etc.

There is a very fast and simple way to get to the stillness, from which you stop this identity. (The fast way is not necessarily the easiest way):

- Take an inhale.
- Let it go in an exhale.
- Take an inhale
- Let it go in an exhale. As you let it go, find that gap between the exhale and the inhale. This gap is natural. This is a gap of stillness, where it feels like everything stops. Try this as many times as you can get this.
- Once you can find that gap of stillness between the exhale and the inhale, look for the gap of stillness between the inhale and exhale.
- When you can clearly find the stillness between the two parts of breath, look for the stillness from which the breath arises. What will happen is that the experience of that stillness will start to grow until it becomes continuous.
- Flip your perception, where that stillness is the vast reality, and the breath merely arises and passes in the stillness.

Stay there. You will likely notice that thoughts will start arising and passing in this stillness. Just as you recognize the breath as empty, recognize the thought, it's underlying emotions, and the sensations as empty.

A related technique is to learn to ""listen to the silence."" Silence is where all sounds arises from. So first get comfortable with finding the stillness in the breath. Then, be aware of the internal dialogues that arises. Then listen to the sound of the internal dialogue, not necessarily the content. Then listen to Silence from which that sound arises from. That Silence is the same as the stillness, experienced aurally rather than kinesthetically. If you can listen to the silence, it is one of the fastest ways to sort out what is bullshit in your mind.

"Identification with thought.

Human beings are the most self-suffering creatures on this planet and the greatest irony is, that we are suffering because of our own actions. We have almost wiped out half the species from the planet to bring well being to ourselves and in spite of all our ""comfort"" we are still not happy. 

The fundamental reason for this discontent and unhappiness is that we are not able to handle our own mind - we are too identified with our own thought process. The nature of the mind is such that once it gets identified with anything, it will only think about that. 

So if you are really interested in your own wellbeing, the first and foremost thing which you need to do is to stop identifying with your own thoughts, they are not even yours. Your thoughts are essentially coming from all of the information which you have collected from your environment, filtered through all your prejudices, judgement and conditioning.

This entire concept of non identification with your ""own"" thoughts is hard for most people to grasp, but this is truly the source of most of our self inflicted suffering.",0

"Practicing mindfulness with the knowledge that noting bad thoughts can make you happy sometimes sets it up in the mind as process with a result - making certain negative/limiting thoughts bad guys in that process that 'need' to be noted. 
This directly opposes the larger idea that thoughts are mental events that don't inherently have power.

Sometimes, that means I seek immediate feedback that I did it right when using mental noting (maybe wanting the feeling to disappear or to feel some internal click after I note a thought). This is thrown me into a loop with off-the-cushion the practice for about a year now. 

So, how can you practice noting/mindfulness without seeking a result when you know doing it right can make you happy?",0

"Hello Reddit. For the past dozen or so weeks I have been meditating daily, the majority of which with the guidance of the Waking Up app. It has been great, and I am keen to explore my practice further. 

Lately I have started to notice that during my formal meditation sessions I can spend quite long periods lost in thought. Of course, the more I meditate, the more I realise I am lost in thought (read: the more I realise how crazy I am), and I start to notice thoughts in all kinds of dusty nooks and crannies. But even though I feel this deepening of awareness, I feel like my concentration could be improved. In particular I would like to be able to concentrate on my breath longer without getting lost in thought (sometimes I'll get lost in thought and snap out of it, ""Okay man, it's time to focus on your breath,"" only to get lost in the same train of thought seconds later). (As a side note: I find it totally amazing how 'lost' you can be while lost in thought. Sometimes snapping out of a train of thought is as jarring as opening your eyes onto a brightly lit landscape.)

So my question is, can you recommend some complementary meditation to supplement my daily mindfulness practice? Is this a matter of 'keep practicing'? In a conversation between Joseph Goldstein and Sam Harris, Goldstein talks about the concentration he developed from his Metta meditations. I am considering adding a daily Metta session to my practice.

"Why one does not see ‘what is True’?

One is carried away as if science, economics or religion-spirituality will remove or undo pain and uncertainty one faces in daily life.

One is carried away as if some one else (guru and so on) has solved the enigma of life and is living as relieved, pleased.

One is carried away as if addition to possessions, relations or knowledge will give one stable relief, stable pleasure.

All pain and uncertainty is psychological discomfort, if you are not in immediate physical danger. Unless you absorb this discomfort without any explanation, there is no chance of seeing ‘what is True’.

The drill I was doing was to stare at the backboard while dribbling the ball to the right hand, left hand, through the legs etc.  Now this isn't hard for everybody but doing this while keeping awareness of your feet and hands and keeping a steady stream of vision on the hoop was challenging. I realized my eyes would be pointed at the hoop while dribbling but I wouldn't actually be looking at the hoop. It was almost like I was day dreaming because I was focused on something I couldn't see. And I found trying to stare at one spot, while keeping a dribble without going into this day dream mode was challenging.

The way awareness makes sense to me is to look at your awareness as an empty space.  The space is filled up with your body and sense organs. So you have the *basic 5 senses*  but **two additional senses** as well which are **thoughts and feelings**. The world is pretty much just a sea of vibrations, and your sense organs pick up different types of vibrations. The goal is to give all of these senses the same amount of attention and not to play favorites.  We play favorites to our vision when watching TV. Our hearing when listening to music and our thoughts when over thinking. Obviously some senses will dominate others depending on what your doing but you can always feel what's going on with your body no matter what's going on. An easy way to turn inward is feeling every step as you walk (or manual breathing) or while doing any activity will help you access deeper dimensions of life. Your field of awareness doesn't strive to be aware of anything, these senses just fall into your field of awareness like water filling up a cup. **So you don't expand your awareness forcefully, you learn to be more receptive**.   Being aware of your inner space while having external things going on feels like being in 2 dimensions of reality at once and is fascinating to me.

So being aware of the sensations of the ball on my fingers, the hoop, the sounds from the ball and the rest of the park, the ground underneath my feet, are all objects in my awareness.  I couldn't be aware of all of these things (not to mention my breath) at the same time for more then a few seconds because the brain naturally filters out things that are not of use at the time.  Most of us are just as unaware of these things in everyday life and I realize I can bring this basketball practice drill into everyday life. Like while talking to someone sometimes you feel like a floating head. Now I try to feel my feet on the floor and feel my hands and notice my breath. Even though I can't sustain this attention on these objects in my awareness for a long time it feels very natural and is a very good way to stay in the moment. Because staying in the moment is sort of like double dutch. You have to Jump into it and just GO.

By maintaining awareness throughout the day I can notice when a headache might be about to form and can adjust whatever I need to. I feel stomach aches when they're just forming and can start taking deep belly breaths.  I notice thought loops and can stop feeding them quicker. Thoughts are just in your head so by feeling your feet on the floor you'll notice those thoughts really aren't that big of a deal and are just one aspect of who you are. I hope this explanation helps the people who never could quite grasp awareness or realize the depths of it.",0
Today marks a year of meditation. In some ways it has changed my life and in others I am not if anything has changed. Either way It is very fulfilling for me to practice staying present with my self and my life. Thanks for listening.,0

"I’m been meditating for half a year now. At first the change I felt was subtle, but overtime the changes were becoming more obvious. With all of this said I have definitely made some progress but I don’t feel like I’m where I’m “suppose” to be at 6 months. People talk of meditating for 2 months and are already seeing drastic changes, while I’m still dealing with monkey mind and can’t concentrate on my breathe to save me life. I asked myself (as well as others) what I was doing wrong, but I realize there’s no wrong or right way as long as I’m getting what I need out out a meditation; I can’t help but feel annoyed with myself that I haven’t mastered my “monkey mind by now”.",0

"Hey all, quick question on if anyone has the full playlist of the  ""Taoist Breathing"" by Bruce Frantzis, the playlist helped me a lot before it was taken off youtube and I even tried to buy it on his website but the website stopped working after I confirmed payment, please help. Here is the first video on youtube:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_CTPTZeD3Xs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTPTZeD3Xs)",0
"I posted something similar a few weeks ago but this has been bothering me so I figured I would post again. 

I have a really, really hard time being myself in a lot of social situations. I am still ""myself"", but a less fun/goofy/outgoing version of me, and as hard as I try I can't ""turn myself on"" (you know what I mean) and I almost am become exhausted just by trying to force myself to be myself. And I find myself unable to relax and feel uncomfortable/strained when socializing sometimes. It really pisses me off, because I will meet people and they will tell me I seem like a more shy person and introverted, but I know that they aren't getting the full version of me. Now, there have been plenty of times where somehow I've had no problem being myself and everything goes fantastically, but I can never figure out what that mental block is that is preventing me in the other situations. 

I always notice in social situations I feel me judging myself the whole time wondering if I look stupid, sound stupid, etc. And I find myself trying to please others (not by lying and saying stuff that they would like, but by saying nothing that would offend/upset/annoy etc) that I am interacting with, not directly, but it is kind of subconscious. 

Some back story: I used to be in a codependent relationship that I have since healed from, but I notice some codependent traits in myself sometimes, although I don't consider myself a codependent person completely. For example, at times, a big desire for acceptance, perfectionism, somewhat controlling, lack of trust, and low self worth. 

Another side note: I grew up religious but I am kind of reforming my beliefs on many things. For example, I started drinking alcohol but my whole lfe growing up I hated alcohol and thought it was a big sin and thought it was stupid but now I am doing it. So I am experiencing some cognitive dissonance as well. 

Sometimes I question ""who am I really"" and ""what do I actually believe about this thing?"" And all of this stuff can make it hard for me to connect with new people. I just care way too much about what people think about me (and I don't know why because I have plenty of things to be proud of and confident about) and I don't know how to stop it. Sorry for the massive amount of text, but thanks in advance for any help/tips/advice.",0
"I started meditating following Sam's (waking up) course three weeks ago. It's all interesting and makes sense to me, but even I'm trying to follow all of his lessons and following the instructions the best I can, nothing special was felt or experienced, besides the fact that I'm more relaxed and less reactive to my negative thoughts.

Today was different, after meditating and ending my session I went to bed as usual but.... jez. My attention was very very sharp, I felt some waves of pleasure going through my belly and it was like the whole stream of thought became very slow. I tried to maintain that good feeling of peace and happiness but it only lasted for 5 minutes.

Is it a thing that experienced mediators can reach with more facility? Should I increase the time of my sessions in order to feel it again? Thanks for reading.",0
I’ve never really been an anxious or stressed person until recently. I’m a senior in college and honestly just worrying about what I’m going to do after I graduate. I’ve wanted to start meditation for a while and I feel like it’s a perfect time for me to fully commit.,0
"I've been using this video's method of mindfulness breathing meditation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMMerxh_12U

Part of the advice it gives is to set an alarm timer to go off after your 5/10/20 minutes so you're not constantly wondering about your remaining time. That's all well and good, but I noticed that when it rings, even though it is pretty low volume and super soft in tone, it never fails to startle me. To the point where I'm sometimes reticent to start meditating, knowing a mini-jumpscare awaits at the end.

Has anyone encountered this? How did you solve this problem?",0
"I have been meditating for over 3 years now. I learned through headspace and then moved onto like 15-20 minutes of just silence. When I first started meditation I did it every day for a year and then I continued to be very structured with it until recently. 

My wife and I have a 4 month old daughter and she has been the focus every since she came out so my practice has slacked to 1-3 days a week tops. I tend to only meditate in the morning. 

Very recently though at work I got my own office and started to meditate in the afternoon. I will focus on my breath and quickly fall into this deep state of sleep/stillness. It’s hard for me to describe but I felt myself going from 10-15 minutes to 20-30 minute sessions. I don’t think it’s sleep because I have fallen asleep during it before and my head will nod out and I will awaken. It reminds me of when I would do a sensory deprivation tank or the short time when I was testing out mantra meditation. I’m not exactly conscious but then again I’m not completely unconscious. 

What would you call this state I reach? Any insight on what this is and how to treat this would be much appreciated. I feel like I stumbled upon something amazing but I would love some more information on it.",0

"I grew up in an unhealthy environment and developed a weak personality as a result. I'm meditating for quiet a while now, but i don't feel like im getting anywhere. Not focusing on your ego and the storylines about yourself and not resisting things are often a big topic in the meditation-app i'm using (headspace), but it's not like there is no identity at all, there is undeniably a core of your personality you can't change. And how am i supposed to not resist if this core of my personality is unfit for living? And even if i manage to accept all this, i'm still leading a pointless, hollow life. I don't know what to do right now and feel like i'm about to end it soon, if i can find the courage for it. Did anybody go through similar problems? Can anybody help me?",0
"I just wanted to share the experience.

It felt AMAZING!

Just sat on the stairs, put on my earphones, played chill sounds.

Like this morning, 30 minutes after woke up, felt nice warm, very relaxed, not hungry.

Decided to try meditate again before breakfast. But no, it just feels so much different than on day-time.

Losing concentration a lot faster, unable to reach any deeper stages. Basically it is more like just sitting, not meditation at all althought basically following same procedure as usually. Persistence or so, is a lot weaker, even if i'd keep sitting, it would not go anywhere close what i can meditate on day-time.

"Hi friends,    
I was on a retreat for a week. Some lectures were about meditation &amp; mindfulness. Here are some notes, which you might find interesting:
  
**Meditation**  
 * is to develop and cultivate mindfulness and positive mental states and learn to maintain stable attention.  
 * sequence: sitting posture, intentions, bodyscan+relaxation, and only then to the mediation object+background awareness.   
* the mind is trained through intentions (e.g. mindful, loving, alert, interested, confident), repetitions (joy, gratitude after distraction &amp; intentions) &amp; positive conditioning.  
* getting to know, training, healing the mind  
  
**Mindfulness**   
* is the optimal/appropriate interaction between attention and background awareness.   
* comes from ""sati"", literally translated: to remember  
* collection is the consequence of regular mindfulness practice.  
* practice of Metta as a balance to mindfulness  
* four basics: body+movement, mood+feelings, sensations (pleasant, neutral, unpleasant), reality  
* four areas: Environment, Self, Other, Reality  
* thoughts about the future and the past are mindful when they are done consciously and intentionally.   
  
I had my notes translated from German by Deepl, so some terms may not be entirely consistent.  
Greetings with Metta",0
"So I have done some meditation before. I have the headspace app and I have done some longer guided meditations on YouTube. I’ve tried doing meditation on my own but struggled real hard. I suffer with mental illness and it is really quite bad at the moment. I have frequent panic attacks and am not able to work. The little headspace meditations don’t seem to be helping a whole lot. I looked into a transcendental meditation class near me but it is very expensive and I’m not really sure its what I need. 
Does anyone have any suggestions? I’ve been told by some people that o have to let go of expectations or wanting a particular outcome from meditation but this level of anxiety is making my life intolerable and I would love to explore this more as I have tried MANY meds and do and will continue to revive therapy.",0
"...so I did a reset: I took a month off, started reading The Mind Illuminated (thanks to everyone who suggested that), and started over with 5 minutes, twice a day--increasing it by a minute every week until I hit twenty minutes twice a day.  

And I'm fed up again. 

[As before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/b5ibal/two_years_of_daily_meditationand_its_still_a_chore/), my twice daily sits are just a chore.   I'm convinced my *technique* is better (thanks to the book), but the results/rewards/experience is still essentially a slog.  I can't say I haven't gotten *anything* from the practice, but the rewards aren't outweighing the challenges.   

The sessions are rarely *unpleasant*\--I can physically sit for the 20 minutes--but after almost three years it would be nice to find myself *welcoming* the opportunity to sit rather than the ever-present ""Ugh, I've got to do *this* again..."".  

So why not just stop?    That's what I'm wrestling with at the moment.   If this is an important (inevitable?) part of the process, then I'd hate to give up at an important milestone.  On the other hand, if this just isn't for me, then why keep banging my head against this wall?",0

DIAMOND SUTRA

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK9u7Jz-vNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK9u7Jz-vNA)

&amp;#x200B;

3:42 - no form or phenomenon (ego, personality, self, separate person, universal self)

&amp;#x200B;

4:10 - Be detached(react calmly to highly emotional circumstances) when practicing compassion and charity without regard to appearances, without regard to form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or any quality of any kind.  

&amp;#x200B;

6:08 - All forms are illusive and unreal.

&amp;#x200B;

7:54 - Discard all arbitrary notions of the existence of a personal self, of other people, or a universal self.  But also discard any notions of the NON EXISTENCE of a personal self, other people or universal self.

&amp;#x200B;

8:30 - Discard not only all conceptions of your own selfhood, other selves, or universal self, but ALSO discard all notions of the non existence of such concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

9:03 - All of the above statements are like a Raft used to cross a river.  Once the river is crossed (you realize you are in the state of enlightenment), you don't need to think about any of these ideas or concepts anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

9:37 - No independently existing object of mind called the highest most fulfilled enlightened mind.  Because there are no separate independent things. Neither is nor is it not.

10:34 - Enlightenment is realized through an internally intuitive process. 

(like laughing at a joke)

&amp;#x200B;

12:16 - A true disciple who enters the stream of enlightenment doesn't see himself as a separate person entering any stream.  He doesn't even consider the concept at all.  He doesn't differentiate himself from others and has no regard for name shape sound odour taste touch or any quality can truly be called a disciple who's entered the stream.

&amp;#x200B;

12:55 - No passing away or coming into existence.  There is no one returning and no one not returning. 14:31

&amp;#x200B;

15:18 - A paradise cannot be created nor can it not be uncreated ??

Develop a mind that is in no way dependent upon sites sounds smells tastes sensory sensations or any mental conceptions.  Develop a mind that does not rely on anything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

22:44 - Buddhas discard all arbitrary conceptions of form and phenomenon, transcended all perceptions, and penetrated the illusion of all forms.

&amp;#x200B;

24:34 - Disciples should leave behind all distinctions of phenomenon, and not allow the mind to be evoked by the senses, sound, odors, flavours, sensory touch or any other qualities.  Stay independent of any thought that arises in your mind.  

&amp;#x200B;

30:38 - Help lead all beings to the shore of awakening but after they have been liberated, know that in truth not a single being has been liberated.  Because if a disciple cherishes the idea of a self, a person, a living being or a universal self, then that person is not an authentic disciple.  Why? Because there is NO independently existing object of mind called the highest most fulfilled awakened mind.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*33:15 - A true disciple knows that there is no such thing as a self, a person, a living being or universal self.  All things are devoid of selfhood or individuality.

&amp;#x200B;

38:40 - When you attain perfect Enlightenment you will feel as if nothing has been acquired.

You will come to the realization that you were always in that state.  It is neither a high state or a low state.  It's the state that you're in right now yet you don't have the wisdom yet to realize that you are already in it and were always in it.

&amp;#x200B;

39:45 - Be ethical and kind knowing there is no distinction between yourself and the selfhood of others. Practice kindness and charity without attachment.

&amp;#x200B;

48:53 - Your existence is very much like your existence in a dream.  Your dream self is not the real you.  It is a creation of your mind, much like all the objects and the people in that dream.",0
"I made an **[app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UnjinxApps.brainWaves&amp;referrer=present)** to help users to build and maintain regular meditation habits in a playful and interactive way. This app lets you start a meditation session and set a goal for how long you want to meditate. The app doesn't let you use your phone or even move it while the session is going on, or else the session is ended. The whole process from setting up the session to informing about the end is guided by a voice based virtual assistant.

Users get points for completing sessions which can help them level up. You can create a streak by holding a meditation session at least once every day, and there are different badges for milestones such as five days streak or twenty days streak. There is also a leaderboard with weekly, monthly and overall section where the users with the highest score in that time period are shown.

The app also has ambience sounds as well as a set of the most well-known binaural beats for those interested in it to help users get into the state of mind they want to reach.

I would really love any feedbacks about the app to help improve it!

"I’ve recently started meditating. As a result, I’m now aware of the fact that my mind basically runs nonstop. I’m constantly thinking about something, and usually that something is some far off person or thing or scenario. And to be honest, this newfound awareness is kind of driving me mad.

"So my recent struggles are with remaining in the ""enlightened"" state as long as possible. Maybe I'm using the expression ""enlightened""  a bit exaggeratedly, but for me it's the good description of the state I'm in.  I managed to enter this state a few times and the best explanation of it is total freedom. Your thoughts pass through you and don't represent anything significant to you, you feel a space and distance from them, it feels like your actions and everything externally is being manifested by some higher intelligence, you feel really connected to the outside world, you can enjoy life in every moment, in every sight you see, sound you hear etc. It's like a constant state of flow. And every new time I was able to enter this state of being, the 'feeling' was more intense than the previous time, I could feel I'm in it deeper than before. The problem is, when I'm in that state, after a while I'm channelling a lot of positive thoughts and emotions from which is hard to distant yourself and not get caught into them. Also, as time passes some kind of undercover fear arises, a fear from losing this blissful state of being I'm currently in. I started meditating 9 months ago and been doing it regularly for around 4 months. I do it 1/2 times per day for around 15 minutes on average and I've gotten to the point where I can use the concepts from meditation in every day life so I can remain present and in the right state. My opinion is that I'm on the right track and I should continue to do what I'm doing, but I would love to hear from someone who had a similar experience or has an advice to give :)",0

the apps i have been comparing for a while now are 10% happier, waking up, headspace and calm. i summarized all the differences here: [https://youtu.be/6MVGJ50d8S4](https://youtu.be/6MVGJ50d8S4)

**10% happier:** high quality content, lots of lectures and courses available; goes pretty deep into spiritual areas that are only loosely related to meditation. unfortunately pretty pricy though once the week-long trial period runs out

**waking up:** app by famous author and neuroscientist sam harris; also extensive lectures and courses as well as guided meditation. the subscription costs as much as it does for 10% happier (100 dollars/year). has a mediation timer as well.

**headspace:** offers less courses and lectures than the previous apps; instead it focusses on guided meditation to a variety of different topics. the one guiding through the meditation has a great voice for it (at least i think so, haha). the subscription is also rather pricy, but in combination with spotify you get a discount. 

**calm:** bit different focus than the others. it sees mediation mostly as a tool to calm down and unwind, but offers other tools for that as well, such as calming sounds, bedtime stories and exercises for your breath. quite a lot cheaper than the other apps, while offering more variety. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure there are plenty of other apps out there worth trying, but those were the biggest names that i heard of. Do you agree? :)",0
"I would like to make a point about smartphones in general and I think it offers a different perspective on whether or not to meditate with an app.

Most people seem to be aware of the concept of 'here and now'. 

The opposite of 'here and now' is 'there and then'.

The perfect symbol for 'there and then' is the smartphone. It is the device that is ALL ABOUT 'there and then'. It is the exact opposite of 'here and now'. 

We don't use our phone to be 'here and now', we use it to connect to the 'there and then'. 

We use it to see what is happening elsewhere, to connect to people who are elsewhere, to look up the past, the possible future... if the mind was a device, it would be the smartphone. 

Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't use smartphones...

But meditation to me seems to be the perfect moment to turn off the 'there and then'-device just for a while.

There are many ways to let us know when the time we choose to meditate is up, if we want that.Timers, watches, church bells in the distance, etc.

A lot of people seem to think that as long as the phone is on airplane mode everything is fine and in that case using an app is also no problem. 

I can't say they are wrong. But I would like to present the other view which is that we have the 'there and then'- device turned on ALL DAY LONG.

So why not make a point and turn it off for whatever time we allocate to meditation?",0
"Can someone help me how to start meditating. I read here that it's not good to use apps, so what is the alternative , how to start, what program should I follow?",0
"Like the title states I recieved this Mala for my birthday ( wish I could post a photo of it, it's made out of the most beautiful stones) I'm wanting to start incorporating it into a meditation practice. Does anyone have experience using one and what are your thoughts on this?",0
"Hey everyone,  


This is not a traditional meditation, more like a safe astral experience in the tools that meditation teaches. The astral world has taught me so much I decided to slowly make series on how to do it yourself. It's all guided so you just relax and enjoy the experience. All that's needed is an open heart. It is also designed for you to meet higher beings during it so if that's a thought you don't like than don't listen to it.  


Have a wonderful day,

"I maybe totally wrong here but after month's of trying to meditate I've started noticing changes. I attend AA and in some meetings we take turn to read from the Big Book. I'm not very confident and I find reading difficult. The difficulty comes from my mind made story. Before I start to read I compulsively start to have this debilitating self talk. The chatter in my head says all sorts of negative things which of cause gets me nervous but it was like I associated with the self talk, it was part of me. Today I'm sat in my meeting about to read and I noticed the voices starting to happen. But this time i had the awareness and space to acknowledge the thoughts then take me my attention away from them and back on to been present. It felt extremely liberating and I was less nervous about reading after this.

Does this make sense?",0
"&amp;#x200B;

I've been meditating for almost 4 years now, can't say it has been consistent, but its been in steady enough for me teach me a lot about myself and the power of consciousness.

Initially, meditation was a form of relaxation from the busy and hectic mind and it was calming and just felt good, this was when I was 13/14, I didn't know much about mindfulness or the power of now and just thought it was a good stress reliever.

Several months down the line, i stopped because i got bored/lazy but this was the next big epiphany for me. I realised how observant and disciplined i had become, not because i had mediated but when i *stopped* meditating thoughts and emotions were leaking out of me constantly.

So I resumed to practise this disciplined and observant state to soften my reactions/action/thoughts and emotions and it has made me a changed man. I can see the world through an eagles eye, and i realise that all my past worries was just an illusion from the future/past.

3 years down the line and I'm still practising, not consistently yet but enough to make me happy and fulfilled.

At this point in time (16) I understand the healing/growing properties of mediation through present consciousness and focus on the individual muscles, the complete freedom and happiness that comes with living in the still present, observing the pain body through meditation to understand any form of pain which has helped me through tougher times and I've been in love with books about mindfulness in the past few years.

My mind is still and calm and the best part is I'm in complete and utter control of my universe I can handle any walls or barriers just through perception to free myself of the so-called 'problem'. It's been a humbling journey.

This might've interested or helped some of you, but I just felt the need to share this quiet experience and hear feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is there any of you that have had a similar experience, how has it been?**

**Is there another path that I can take a look at that you know of?**

**Is there more I can learn?**

Haha thanks for reading.

So a couple of technical questions that I have encountered so far: \[so I just sit 2-3 times per day for 10 mins\]

[www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ08yx1LBzc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ08yx1LBzc)

\- for example in the above guideline vid it says ''focus on the blank'' where I assume the ''blank'' is the same ''thing'' as the ''murk'' known from Kasina meditation - is that correct? (I dont see any other option for it to be something else, really)

\- When I am to ''focus'' how this should be done from the technical point of view, as the ''blank'' is just a collection of white black grey etc dots , like a TV static noise when you put the screen on an empty channel

(I tend to look past it or maybe ''in between'' the dots)

\- When I am refocusing on the blank, my eyes tend to do physical movements. Sometimes I have to consciously move the gaze upwards because otherwise my eyes start to open (My left eye doesnt close 100% - some sort of genetic malfunction ;) my father had the same trait) -is this okay

\- Saliva swallowing - this is unavoidable but it tends to ruin deeper concentration, any advice?

\- Tongue posture? On the roof of my palate?

I'd be grateful for your time and answers - let today fill you with peace and happiness :) Namaste",0

"Hello good people.

So I have been doing meditation on and off for the past year and a half , and I am a noob.

My motivations are to be a more calm person , a person that can separate logic from emotion and see clearly in any situation and I feel that meditation can provide me with just that.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is , I have some issues regarding mediation that I need some help with.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Position - I've researched some guides and they pretty much all say to sit straight without anything to lean on , I find that to be very difficult as my back is starting to hurt after 7 minutes, sitting at the half lotus position my feet begin to hurt and begin to go numb , that pretty much distracts me as I focus on trying to realign my body for better comfort rather than focusing on the nothingness. Do I really need to sit straight or can I lean on something?
2. Distractions - I have ADHD , keeping my mind numb and empty is hard enough as it is but distractions.. well they distract me easily, unfortunately I have no better place to conduct my meditation.. ear plugs or headphones are considered bad habits , but are they really bad?
3. Duration - I don't really know how much time I should conduct my meditation but I've found that 15 minutes are the best medium for me as anything above that is hard to maintain , is that a good time to start with?",0

" 

Over the past five years I have been diving deeply and consistently into the nature of reality and myself. They're both the same thing. I have had several deep and very profound and indeed life changing nondual and psychedelic experiences at this point. I understand that everything in the totality of existence is all fundamentally and inexorably one. I have traveled to places within consciousness that are beyond the human imagination. I have had my sense of self and eradicated and reformed several times now. Looking into the viewport of infinity is indeed breathtaking beyond all comprehension. You really are absolutely infinite and so beautifully glorious beyond what our bodies and brains are physically evolved to comprehend right now.

However there is something within me that is seemingly contently disinterested with phenomenological existence. I do not want to play this game anymore. I feel like no matter what I experience in this life, no matter where I go there will still always be a part of me that is just over the experience of existing as an individuation of consciousness at any level whether it be at a human level, bacterium level or godlike cybernetic alien level it’s all not the absolute truth, just more of this multiversal, multidimensional game of exploratory consciousness.

After I live my life and die there is a very strong feeling at the “core” (there is no core) of my consciousness that I never want to reincarnate in any way. While that is an ego driven statement I feel that there is something within myself that this is coming from a place of much deeper much more comprehensive inner standing and understanding of phenomenological existence and it’s alternative merging COMPLETELY into God consciousness so fully that any hope or possibility of incarnation into the realm of form is entirely extinguished. No thought no mind, no form no play, simply infinite incomprehensible nothingness, the purest expression of God.  

Over the past year a feeling has arisen within myself that wants this life of this specific individuation of consciousness to be the last physical expression that this individuation of consciousness ever experiences. The feeling and sense of relief is what I long for. I long for the ending of all experience by this individuation. The thought of an I experiencing reality no longer is the all encompassing thing that it once was. Now the idea of an I experiencing reality seems so superficial and somewhat shallow in a sense. I enjoy life and its many phenomena but I can so clearly see ( at an increasing rate) the illusion of all of the realm of form.  

Expression, experience and phenomenological existence go together. And there is such a powerful longing within my energetic composition to just have relief from being, relief from form, relief from experience I feel like I have done this so many times. I feel that I have played this game an infinite number of times. Now there is a tiredness to it all. I am all,every subatomic particle, every atom, every cell, every organism in the multitude of multiverses every object in all of existence. I am the infinite Holon. I am immortal, timeless, and infinite in every way. Yet and still within this body, within this specific individuation of consciousness, within this trans-temporal energetic being I feel a strong urge to never want to return to this place. It matters not what form consciousness takes it all boils down to this. Same shit different form. You are God experiencing itself in every way that there is and isn't.

After you have seen into infinity and lived in that place all of the forms become trivial they are no longer something to go after or to awe at when gazed upon. Its all infinite and there are never-ending forms but it all becomes ‘predictable’. You predict the outlandish and the mundane to the point where it becomes all just “meh” at a certain point of being blasted into infinity so many times. Viewing and being the infinite myriad of forms organisms, technologies, energies eventually it reaches a point of simply a pretty existential first person light show. The illusion is seen through and compared to truth the realm of forms and limitation becomes shallow in its substances.

The transcendence of survival is a necessary place to come to in this work and an inevitable point. I have not transcended survival and am still subject to it’s whims but there are times ( and they are becoming increasingly more common) where I can get into states of consciousness where in those moments I would be 100% OK with dying. However I am only 22 years old and thus I would like to complete my bucket list before I leave this place and I have so much work to do on myself in this life; and so much more fun to have; and so many more things to explore. I do not hate life I enjoy it and all of it’s beautiful weirdness but it’s illusory nature no longer has the same charm and allure as it had before in my perception. The world of form is BS and while it is truth on a relative level it will never be the absolute truth due to the fact that life is navigating forms, whether they be physical or nonphysical. It is because of this why “I” (at a level beyond ego that is inexplicable to me currently) want out of this game at all levels permanently.

You could incarnate into any multitude of alien species, Tryptamine entities, light beings, demigods, lichens, molds, insects, bacterium. While it is all you exploring and experiencing yourself once complete nondual awareness is had this experiencing looses it’s allure. It doesn't matter what form you take anymore. The destination and “point” of it all is the same. Simply put ULTIMATE UNION WITH GOD. This means a complete secession of all types of form and all types of experience, it is the embodiment and paradox of absolute nothingness. Not nonexistence, because God is infinite and thus nonexistence cannot exist; but nothingness in the sense of no longer being an individuation of consciousness bound to form and experience of any and all kind. It is this secession which is the omega point of this creation of this game.

 According to Buddhism the entirety of the realm of form is suffering in some way. This is Samsara. Nirvana is the release of this and the permanent secession of the individuated conscious experiencing of phenomenological existence. Absolute union with God. No more false boundaries, no more illusions. Just the simple truth.

All incarnation is an infinitely intelligent yet amnesiac God exploring to know its infinite self. However there comes a point where for individuations this experiencing of fundamentally illusory forms is no longer necessary for understanding. There is a transcendent something beyond being, beyond phenomena. Phenomenological existence is not the only way that God can know itself. However it is the only way that we can know ourselves. As lifeforms we highly value life to the point of delusion. I have no way to back up what I am about to say here; but life and the totality of phenomenological existence in my experience feels like a preliminary training ground for something else. This place is illusion and with illusion comes pain and suffering in one way or another. At the end of the day all holons of existence especially organisms organisms “want” to be happy, and to know that they are God. I do wonder if there will be a point (Yes I know time does not truly exist) where all individuations of consciousness in the totality of phenomenological existence will realize and embody God consciousness and this section of the game will end. It’s just a thought I have sometimes. I know that God is infinite and thus I am infinite.",0

So I already know the answer to my question. How do you meditate every day? Well, you sit down and you meditate. Every day. No exception.

"OK so as I’ve had medication which helps a little bit (but I try to avoid because of ramifications and to avoid a tolerance so it works better when I truly need it) I’ve noticed just practicing being mindful throughout the day helps.  My biggest trouble was being able to sit down and do math, but I’ve gotten a little better at doing it. I found that studies have proven 52 minutes of work and 17 minutes of break is beneficial for most people. Ive tried the 25 minute Pomodoro but it doesn’t help me as much as the 52 min on 17 min off.  In my 17 min off I was planning on doing 10+ min meditation at least 3 times a day to help with my patience and being able to focus.  I’m highly active so I’m not too worried about getting to jittery or impatient to walk outside as I already do that in my breaks .  Do you guys think adding meditation 3+ times a day is worth it or it is better to just do it once or twice a day morning and before bed? I kind of think more is better when it comes to meditation as long as you’re not getting worn out by doing like a full hour.",0
"1. Open your jaw just so that your teeth aren't touching, close your eyes so that your eyelids are completely smooth and unwrinkled, tilt your head into a neutral position so that you are looking straight ahead, and relax any tension in your cheeks, forehead, the inside of your ears, and your neck.



2. Take a breath deep and slow enough so that you can feel the satisfaction of exchanging the carbon dioxide in your blood for the oxygen in your breath.



3. Examine how it feels to be angry. More specifically, what does your body and mind feel like that lets you know that you are angry (or whatever emotion) in the first place? Where do these feelings appear? Maybe your chest, or throat, or muscles, or maybe somewhere more abstract. Just try to feel as many of the physical and mental sensations that come together to form the emotion.



4. At this point you might realize that anger has certain physical signatures, such as clenched jaw, furrowed brow, narrowed eyes, increased respiratory rate, etc. You might realize that it's actually hard to stay angry without the constant background of its physical markings.



5. Try and notice your most immediate next thought. Is it an image, or words, or or memory? What of? Whatever it is, in my experience it tends to take a second or two for the thought to appear. And so for those milliseconds before it does, I can't honestly say that I ""feel"" angry. Because in the absence of the physical and mental sensations that define it,  can it actually be there? 



How can you be angry if you don't or can't feel anger? 



It's gotten to the point for me where relaxing my face and taking a breath (step 2) is all it takes to release my anger. It can even enhance feelings of satisfaction and gratification, for example if I'm walking in the sun after having been in an air conditioned room for too long.

"When you feel that sudden urge to scratch an annoying itch, or when you feel that something catches your eye, or when you consider giving in to a craving for a bad habit. When anything arises that seeks to distract you from the real, important nature of being present in the world, ask yourself this:

Will this change anything? Will I be better off after doing this?

Will scratching that itch change your position in the world? Or, will it condition you to be at mercy to the slightest annoyance from your body, will it by all likelihood make this itch stronger?

When a distraction appears, ask yourself whether you will truly gain from giving in to it’s warm and shallow reassurance. The answer is no. Scratching that damn itch won’t change a thing, and being aware of this allows you to remove its power. Now you’re in control.

We are all aware that the clock is ticking, our deaths await. So you can remember that every time a distraction arises you have one single choice: do you allow yourself to forget, or do you make every effort to stay aware of how precious the present is.",0

"Hi folks,

Long story short, I've been practicing meditation for awhile and lately have had some interesting changes. I practice the Ananda mandela often ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgFF0jewIiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgFF0jewIiM)), and as i've continued to do over some years I've grown completely use to my hands clamming, feeling magnetized to the floor, raging with vibrating energy, etc.

The last few months however, i've slowly been getting this electric-like, popping/cracking happening in my chest, like an electrical current jumping back and forth from my lungs? Last night I got much deeper than usual and it happened non-stop the whole session, although I just allowed this to happen to try to make sense of it, yet still can not tell if its healing or harming.

I read ""Qigong Meditation: Embryonic Breathing by Jwing-Ming Yang a few years ago and understand that it's very possible to direct qi in a damaging direction, but the book didn't really describe this feeling and i'm not trying to direct a mass of energy flow, moreso just stimulating my overall body. I know I should practice traditional qi-gong, but that's a whole different ballpark and even if I did, I'm sure this ""thing"" will persist at least until I learn how to collect and store qi in the dantien properly.

I'm a man of science and reason ( also kind of a hippie), and although there isn't much peer-reviewed double blinded studies for this kind of stuff, I'm hoping someone can help point me in the right direction. For all I know, I might be blowing up nerves or arterioles.

There are now times where focusing on my breath makes me feel a bit anxious. Maybe I am trying too hard? I also find it hard to keep my natural rythym of breath. When I focus on my breath, I can't help but control it and it feels unnatural.

The only thing is, I'm not aware that I'm present? I feel like I've jammed myself in some paradigm that's left me unaware of being aware of my surroundings. 

So for example, I'm not aware of my thoughts, which seems to be subconsciously taking me towards a reliance on alcohol and cigarettes.

After abstaining from weed, today I finally gave in to smoking with friends as I'm travelling back home in the upcoming week and I'm not gonna see my friends for a long time. 

Well shit, did I have some deep thoughts. My mind is replaying all of the stupid stuff I've done under the guise of not caring because I'm ""present"". Now, I'm not saying being presence is bad in the slightest. What I am saying is that unless you're completely aware that you're tapped into those physical senses, then your life will consist of nothing but stimulations. 

I feel unmotivated, unambitious, and focused on the wrong things in life. It feels like I'm stuck in the matrix, despite believing not to be.

If not for the weed, it would've taken a long time pick up on this shit. That being said, it might be worth to point that that justification of weed is what has brought be back on many occasions; developing dependence. 

How can I maintain an awareness of my own mind when I'm so focused on everything other than what's going on in my head. My feeling towards people is apathetic, which I thought meditation would've helped with. 

The alcohol &amp; smoking stops from now on, but what's the best way to get myself back on track to what I want to do?",0
Can anyone here tell me what to think when you try to meditate for the very first time?,0
"So I first started meditating 5 months ago, and it was great, but after a month or two of daily meditation I kinds fell off the rails for a few months, but I'm back at it and loving it and feel great. Going for daily walks again, going with the flow, budgeting my finances, couldn't be going better :)
How is everyone else's meditation going, would love you hear from you :)",0
And would it help with attention deficiency disorders like ADHD and things like that,0

"Before I started my meditation, I was pretty frustrated because of a conversation I had with my sister in law.   So I decided to meditate when I got back to my place.  This time the meditation was different. I felt much more focused and aware. But what I have never experienced was the “release” of emotions and other stuff inside me.  It felt like things I had stuffed down deep inside we’re leaving me.  It was a 20 minute meditation. I’m tempted to try a much longer session, like 1 hour. Not sure if that’s a good idea. So basically I’m asking what was it that I experienced?",0
"And if so,how?",0
"I often find it difficult to motivate myself to do sitting meditation not because I find it unpleasant (I've done hour-long sits with no problem) but because I already spend so much of my day doing various sitting activities that the idea of sitting *even more* is unappealing to me; it can be a lot more appealing to do (Mahasi-tyle) noting while I am walking or cycling because it gives me a chance to move around.

So my question is, is there an optimal balance between sitting and moving meditation?  In particular, is there a minimal amount of sitting meditation that I need to get in order to make progress in noting, or does it not matter?",0

"my mindfulness practice seems to be progressing at a steady rate , which often feels very rewarding in day to day life. However im finding more and more im unable / lack the motivation to talk to people that ive known for a very long time. I feel this is because im becoming better at being present in the moment , however if i am totally present , speaking to people often feels very pointless as to me things seem right just the way they are . 
I feel people may say that this is a good thing as i no longer feel the need to be someone im not and that i shouldn’t feel forced to speak to people when i dont want to, however , this makes me very unsociable most of the time in social situations, which i feel is stopping me from getting the most out of my life . 
I am becoming very unsociable at work as i no longer try to make conversation with the people i work with, which can make other people uncomfortable. I feel calm and peaceful most of the time, which is nice , but im often missing the way interacting with other people used to feel before i ever started meditation. 
Is this a usual stage in mindfulness practice ? i am currently reading the book ‘mindfulness in plain english’ which makes a lot of sense while i am reading it , but i sometimes feel some of the concepts just arent applicable to society , which worries me as it is not my aim to become a monk living in solitude . 
i want to live life as the real ‘me’ as mindfulness claims is the goal of unlocking, but what if the real me is unable to survive in this world and i may be better off shaping my ego to suit what makes me happy by trying to connect with those around me rather than becoming comfortable with just being .  
If i carry on down this path do things usually resolve themselves ?",0

"How to Meditate for Beginners: let’s get you started!

You’ve read about the many benefits of meditation, you’ve got friends or family members who swear by their 20 or 45 minutes a day, you’ve heard celebrities say they couldn’t live without it, and now you’re ready to take the plunge! But wait, there’s a hitch, you think. What, exactly, are you as a rank beginner supposed to be doing?

&amp;#x200B;

That’s why we’re here! And we’re so glad you’ve joined us! Read on for some basic mindfulness meditation instructions that will get you sitting in no time flat.

&amp;#x200B;

What not to expect

Want to be like those memes of blissful mediators by the sea who seem to be communing with the universe with nary a care – or a misplaced thought – in the world? Not going to happen. Want to sit down, set your timer, and enjoy a 20-minute thought-free bliss bubble? Nope. Hoping your chakras will immediately begin whirling and twirling? Unlikely. Think you’ll start levitating and float away, leaving this mundane existence behind you? Implausible, thank heavens. Meditation is much more down-to-earth than that.

What to expect

[Meditation](https://vinyasayogaacademy.com/200-hours-yoga-teacher-training-in-india.php) is about connecting with the completeness of the here and now. The way we teach it, it’s very grounded. You sit straight and still, observe, let go, come back, and discover the rich fullness of the present moment. Since you’re not giving in to distractions, you have the space to connect with mind’s creativity and become aware of the stream of thoughts and emotions it produces. And what are you going to do about these thoughts and emotions? You’re going to acknowledge them without giving in to fascination or frustration, and let them simply go back to where they came from, like a wave that arises and naturally and inevitably merges back into the sea.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would you do such a thing? Because meditation is calming. It’s sane. It comes with a host of benefits for body and mind. It will help you discern which of the thoughts and emotions that arise in your mind are worthy of your attention. It puts you back in touch with your basic goodness. The qualities you develop through mindfulness and awareness meditation make your world a better place. And so much more.

&amp;#x200B;

How to meditate – for beginners

Meditation is popular, and there are many good meditation techniques for beginners and more advanced practitioners alike

Find a quiet place and settle on a comfortable chair, bench or cushion.

You may want to decide how much time you’d like to devote to sitting in the beginning. Consistency is key. Even a few minutes every day will get you off to a great start.

Take a moment to check in with your posture. Try to find a position that allows you to keep your back straight.

Set aside your industrious conceptual mind. Breathe. Tune in to the feeling of being present. Take stock of your physical presence as you breathe.

Note physical tensions and mental concerns. Acknowledge them with kindness and invite them to relax and release.

Tune in to the process of breathing. Feel the breath in your belly. Don’t concern yourself with analyzing or modifying your respiration, just feel it and center your awareness on the web and flow.

Breathe in: you’re aware that you’re breathing in. Breathe out: you’re aware that you’re breathing out.

When you notice that your mind has wandered, gently but firmly bring it back to the breath.

This is mindfulness: training in awareness, acknowledging, letting go and coming home to the breath and the present moment.

When you are ready to end your meditation session, relax, stretch, and enjoy a moment of gratefulness before picking your busy life back up where you left it, renewed and refreshed.

Check out our video on Take Your Seat – how to find an upright and comfortable posture for meditation:

Even practicing a couple of minutes of mindful awareness helps us put things in perspective, check in with our feelings and reboot. Some people enjoy taking mini-meditation breaks at work or at school; others like to devote a period of time every day to meditate alone or with others.",0
"Hello everyone. Tomorrow there’s a concert that I’m going to attend, that my ex fwb will be there with his new girl. I haven’t seen them together in person, but just by pictures I get really emotional (I feel super bad). 

I thought about not going, but that would imply that I’m running away from this situation

AND I also thought that it would be a great opportunity to prove to myself that I can handle discomfort and be okay. 

The thing is, my anxiety is almost making me completely give up (I haven’t had the symptoms yet but the thoughts are coming and Really getting to me) saying that when I get there I’ll feel super bad, that I might get s panick attack or something.

So, I started a plan to meditate today for 20 minutes, tomorrow morning 20, afternoon 10 and 10 at night before going to the show. I don’t know that if doing this I’m running away from feelings instead of letting them be. I’m kinda confused 

What are your best tips for me? How do you see this situation?",0

"Thought I would share a way I have started clearing away negative memories from my past...that I continually remunerate in my mind. 

I see a huge picture wall infront of me, the wall is digital almost like a huge version of the gallery on your phone.

I find myself with a magic eraser which feels like a chalk duster from back in high school days. I then think of any memories which i have had particular problems with - memories that were particularly painful or embarrassing and rub them out with the eraser. As i am doing it I feel the associated weight of the painful memories leave my body. I always feel so much lighter after doing this meditation.

How do you guys visualize or go about clearing these negativities out of your bodies?",0

"I practice Vipissana meditation relatively consistently. One bottleneck that I have come across repeatedly in my longer sessions starts as a strange, pleasurable sensation in my prostate area embarrassingly enough. I sort of visualize it as a ball of energy that rises every time I take a breath; starting from the prostate and working its way up the body like its following a path of some sort. The sensation is accompanied by an erection, risen heart rate and deep breaths. The sensation eventually becomes so intense that I start focusing on it rather than my breath and then it subsides. Im not sure what it is but if It happened recently I find myself grasping for it alot and when it does happen it disrupts my session. Any explanation or solution would be helpful. Thanks.",0
"I've only recently started meditation (maybe 2/3 months). I've been attending a local buddhist centre and doing meditation sessions there along with my personal practice at home.

So Mindfulness of the breath or body awareness is great! There's struggle points for sure, but overall I can see and feel the benefits of this practice. Metta Bhavana on the other is odd. I'm not getting it so far? A buddhist at the centre described Metta Bhavana as a 'slow burner', he said it took him 9 years to really appreciate the practice.

So I guess my question is, what are the benefits of Metta Bhavana? I can't seem to must up loving-kindness to myself in the first stage of the meditation. Am I doing it wrong?",0

"Today in meditation I started to imagine a cubic rock hitting the surface of a body of water. The point of impact was intense an violent but as I panned out of the image the outer ripples and wave became less intense.

"I’ve been using the Waking Up app from Sam Harris for 6-12 months and finding it very helpful once I get into a flow of consecutive days.

However, in today’s daily meditation and many older ones he says how you should observe the breath rather than anticipate/control it.

I’ve always found this difficult for some reason, always feeling like I’m almost choosing when to inhale/exhale.

"This morning I needed to clear my mind, I found a “thank you” affirmation video which was an hour long. It wasn’t a meditation video but I found myself breathing/relaxing as if it was. 

It was repetitive, listing about 25 different things to be thankful for and then it repeated over and over again. “Thank you for my hands. Thank you for my feet. Thank you for ...” My mind didn’t stray and then I fell asleep during.

I started dreaming that I was in my workout clothes with my earpiece in and I could still hear the affirmations. I was putting groceries away and my husband came to the kitchen looking for a particular pan but it was dirty and he started complaining about it. I tried to take the earpiece out so I could talk to him but I couldn’t get it out and I couldn’t turn off my phone. 

He kept getting louder and I was upset and in my dream I began punching him in the face. He fell back and I grabbed and pulled at his hair. It was very violent. And all the while I’m trying to get the affirmations to stop. I get off of my husband and a naked man comes and stands in front of me and my husband accuses me of having a new man. This only makes me more angry and I start hitting him all over again. When I finally woke up the video had ended. I was out of breath and shaking. An hour later and I feel sick to my stomach. 

My husband and I are actually going through a divorce and trying to coexist in the same apartment. I think - I know - I have a lot of pent up frustration and anger. It manifested in my dream no doubt.

### Abstract

### Purpose

This pilot study evaluated whether a brief, 5‐min single‐session of mindfulness meditation (MM) training could lessen cardiovascular and affective reactivity to speech and anger recall. Moreover, we tested if trait levels of perseverative cognitions (PCs) moderated these relationships.

### Methods

Participants completed online survey measures including PCs; thereafter, they completed a 5‐min resting baseline, 2‐min speech task, and 5‐min anger recall task while measures of BP were collected. The experimental group received a 5‐min MM training session before the resting baseline period.

### Results

Repeated measures ANOVA were conducted for condition (MM vs. control) and period (repeated: baseline, speech, anger recall) on blood pressure (BP). The MM group showed less systolic and diastolic BP reactivity during speech and anger recall than the control group. There were no effects observed for negative affect nor did PCs moderate the BP findings.

### Conclusion

Thus, even 5 min of MM training can have momentary cardiovascular benefits, having important implications for the training and implementation of MM programs.",0
"I just started meditating about 1 month ago. I begin to experience hallucinations. 
Not strong ones. 
I lay down in a dark room after a nice hot bath, covered up in blankets, blindfolded, headphones on with the music i discovered. 
At first i cannot seem to find peace, i am afraid that someone walks in and a stream of thoughts rushing through my mind for what feels like an eternity.
Then i begin to think if its even worth it, and when my timer is going of.
But suddenly i begin to be aware of my body.
My feet is buzzing.
My hands are buzzing.
I am aware of my breath.
A warm feeling spreads from my chest and through out my body.
I begin to feel weightless.
I cannot feel my feet.
I cannot feel my hands.
Next is that is feels like i am looking out through my eyelids. I begin to look around in the dark room. 
It's beginning to feel like an out of body experience and it's amazing, yet scary.

Just wanted to share the experience and hear if anyone experience the same.

"Karma Keeps All of Creation in the Stream of Evolution to Higher States of Consciousness.


The Sanskrit word Karma means action.
The Law of Karma governs all actions to ensure that everything and everyone remain in the stream of evolution.
The Law of Karma states :
As you sow, so shall you reap.
As human beings we have thoughts.
These thoughts often lead to desires.
Then we perform actions to fulfill our desires.
The consequences of those actions, or the fruits of those actions, are determined by Natural Law.
The influences of your actions radiate out into the Universe and strike against everything.
At some point those influences will return to you:
They leave deep impressions in your mind.
These impressions lead to other thoughts, other desires, and other actions.
This is how Creation is evolved:
Through actions and consequences of actions;
Through all the activity here in the relative field.
The purpose of the Law of Karma is to keep all of Creation in the stream of evolution:
All human beings in some lifetime will experience Higher States of Consciousness.
Perhaps in this lifetime you desire to meditate with a practice that transcends the relative field:
To experience your Self by ItSelf referring to ItSelf;
Your Self That is Divine Being.
With repeated and regular referring to your Self in your Meditation Practice, you rise to That status of Divine Being;
To That status of Universal God.
Now you are freed from the bondage of Karma:
The influences of actions no longer leave deep impressions on your mind that lead to new actions.
You must live out the Karma you came into this lifetime with, but there will be no new Karma created for future lifetimes.
You are freed from the cycle of birth and death.
You are established in your Self.
You know your Self as separate from all the activity here in the world.
You no longer perform action.
You know all actions are performed by Natural Law.
This is the purpose of our lives as human beings:
To rise to That status of Divine Being;
To expand our happiness and fulfillment.
Do your Meditation Practice regularly and transcend repeatedly.
Rise to That status of Divine Being in this lifetime now.
Be your Self.

"I went through a traumatic event when I was a child, and it has recently come to the surface of my awareness and it's extremely difficult to not let it affect my entire reality. I haven't been officially diagnosed, but my therapist said that what I'm experiencing seems to fulfill the requirements for PTSD.

I was never great about consistently sitting for meditation, but I still felt mindful and calm throughout my days. However, when the trauma from my childhood resurfaced, mindfulness just increased any senses of anxiety, which just means that I have a lot of pain to work through. However, when I sit to meditate now, the anxiety builds up so quickly that I feel it physically, it is almost painful. It's almost like when I sit, I'm just mindfully placing my hand on a hot pan. I have a sense that sitting with the pain is what I need, but at the same time, I may need to do other things than just breathing through the pain.

I have seen some posts that meditation sometimes can exacerbate problems with trauma or PTSD in some cases. I usually do not ask for insight but maybe I should - anybody have some?",0

These conditions can never satisfy you, because they’re changing. When you try to find security and permanent happiness in things that are forever changing, you’re going to be terribly disappointed”

Do I need to visit monks in different parts of the world to learn ""surreal,true"" meditation? Or can I achieve it just at home? Are there specific forms/positions I should do to achieve mindfulness? Thanks for the help. I really appreciate it.",0
"Hey everyone, this is my first post in this community.

First of all, thanks for all the inspiration you guys have given me! It's really helped me continue my meditating journey.

So I've been meditating for about 1,5 years now and I've dealt with a lot of difficulties that occur while meditating that no longer bug me (not being able to sit still, getting sleepy etc.)


Now, I often have music in my head since I listen to a lot of music and also play instruments, but at times while I'm meditating it can be really distracting.

Does anyone experience this too? And how do you deal with it? I'd love to hear your experiences :)",0
"Although enlightenment is beyond thoughts and words, and speaking about it takes you further away from it, this to me is an interesting perspective and may be beneficial to some;

Enlightenment is like a fish in the ocean searching for the ocean.

Enlightenment is the very nucleus of our being; going to the core of our self and living our life from there. We all came into this world gifted with innocence but gradually, as we became more intelligent, our innocence was lost. We were born with silence but, as we grew up, lost the silence and were filled with words. We lived in our hearts and as time passed, we moved into our heads.

The reversal of this life passage is enlightenment. It is the journey from the head back to the heart, from words back to silence and regaining our innocence in spite of our intelligence. Although this may sound simple, it is actually a great achievement.

Knowledge should lead us rather to that beautiful point of unawareness and the realisation that the purpose of knowledge is ignorance. Yes, the purpose of knowledge is ignorance! The completion of knowledge ultimately leads to amazement and wonder, that which makes you aware of this existence. Mysteries are to be lived, not understood. One can live life fully in its completeness, in its totality.

Enlightenment is further that state of being unshakeable under any circumstances. Come what may, nothing can rob the smile from your heart. Going beyond the limited boundaries, and feeling ‘‘all that exists in this universe belongs to me,’’ is enlightenment.

Un-enlightenment is easy to define. It is limiting yourself by characterising your being along geographical, cultural or religious lines. It is like a child saying, ‘‘my dad is better than your dad,’’ or ‘‘my toy is better than your toy.’’ I think most people around the world are stuck in that same childish frame of mind: only the toys have changed.

Adults say, ‘‘my country is better than your country’’ or ‘‘my religion is superior to your religion.’’ A Christian will say, ‘‘The Bible is truth,’’ and a Hindu will say, ‘‘The Vedas are the truth. They are very ancient.’’ Muslims will say, ‘‘The Koran is the last word of God.’’ We attribute glory to something just because we are from that culture, not for what it is.

The whole evolution of man should be from being somebody to being nobody, and from being nobody to being everybody. This is enlightenment.

"I am an amateur  meditator. I have been meditating  on and off for about 6 months now. My technique  of mediation is that I focus on my surrounding (air,sound etc) so today as I was in the middle of a session  I felt weird  sensations my body felt like a mass of energy every part of it buzzing but in a very low frequency, breathing got heavier and heartbeat felt a little  high but  my mind wasn't completely shut in between all this meaning  I wasn't in a ""no mind"" state my thoughts were still simultaneously present... Idk how to feel about this.

"Imagine a ball in front of you.
Imagine a ball of the most suitable size that you can think of most comfortably.
It can be about the size of a soccer ball, small bead and small dot, and it can be about the size of a huge universe.

The surface of the ball is so transparent that the contents of it can be seen very well.
Standing in front of the ball, looking inside, the ball seems to be filled with golden grains of sand.

Rubbing your eyes and looking closely into the ball once again, you see that the ball is filled with silvery liquid, not the golden grains of sand you saw before.

It seems certain that your body looking at the ball in front of the ball, the ball, and your consciousness that imagining all of this at this moment, are clearly separated as different entities.

Now imagine another ball.

You are in the ball, not outside the ball.
You were in the ball from the beginning, rather than entering it from outside the ball.
Your body and consciousness were born in the ball from the silver liquid in the ball.

Your body and consciousness are contained in the ball.
Your body and consciousness and the ball are exactly the same one, and in a sense the ball is contained in your body and consciousness.

In the ball, there is another being that has another body and consciousness that was born inside the ball.

Both you and the other being are contained in the ball.
Your body and consciousness, the body and consciousness of the other being, and the ball are exactly the same one, and in a sense the ball is contained in your body and consciousness, and the body and consciousness of the other being.

You and the other being are facing each other.

From your point of view, you are the main character of the ball, and you are looking at the other being.
From the point of view of the other being, the other being itself is the main character of the ball, and the other being is looking at you.

Your ball and the ball of the other being are not separate balls but the same ball.
You and the other being are experiencing the ball at the same time on each side and are connected to each other, include each other and are the same one.
The ball sees itself from the point of view of you and from the point of view of the other being.

You and the other being and the ball are all overlapped.
You selectively perceived you and the other being from the ball.
You are the silver liquid itself and the ball itself.

You can selectively recognize anything from silver liquid in the ball.

You can recognize the silvery liquid as a huge space surrounding you.
In this space, you can recognize that there are several buildings built and many people walking around you.

You can also recognize the buildings and those people's past and future.
You can recognize how the buildings were built and what kind of life those people are going to live.

You can return the perceptions back to the silvery liquid.
The spaces, buildings, people and time all disappear and the ball is only filled with silvery liquid.

You can also return recognition of silvery liquids.
The ball is filled with something, but it seems empty because it is not recognized.

You can also return the boundary of the ball that forms the shape of the ball.
The boundary between the inside and outside of the ball disappears and is not recognized.",0
"Ive been meditating for a month now and have been using the focus of the breath technique, with a mix of body focus and transcendental. The reason I got into meditation was of really bad anxiety and slight depression. I knew I had to do something and work on myself. Happy to say I have recovered a-lot! I would like to start tapping in to my ego... myself, during meditation. How would I achieve that during meditation, realizations that come to mind. Increasing the time you meditate?",0
"I have been practicing meditation daily for a little over a month now and am amazed at the dramatic shift in my mind, with the debilitating thoughts and anxiety decreasing every day. I noticed today after an uncomfortable conversation on the phone with my boyfriend that while I was able to calm my racing thoughts relatively quickly, my body became extremely tense, and is still feeling tense hours later. My sympathetic nervous system reacts instantaneously to a stressful event, much more quickly than I can even perceive. So before I even have a chance to be mindful, my shoulders are clenching, my throat is constricted, I become lightheaded, dry-mouthed, etc, etc. I'm guessing that my stress hormones start shooting full throttle and don't know when to start or stop. My question is, should I continue with my regular meditation practice (simple mantra meditation 15 min. 2x daily + occasional guided meditations) and hope for my sympathetic nervous system to catch on in time, or would you recommend adding another practice or guided meditation to help facilitate this shift?",0
"A lot of the posts here are asking about ""What do I do when experiencing negative thoughts?"" and the answers are always a feverish frenzy of ""Anchor to your breath"", ""Stay single pointed and concentrate awareness on your breath and they will fall just as they came"". These are correct answers and are what you should be doing.

Then a few other posts come about like ""What do I do when I'm experiencing POSITIVE thoughts?"" And suddenly all discipline is gone, answers like ""Enjoy them"" or ""Use them until it no longer serves you"" are instantly voted to the top. There are 2 major things wrong with that. 

First, there is  no discipline. How can you expect yourself to not stray from your breath during bad thoughts if you are not disciplined during good thoughts? You won't, and you'll be a slave to your thoughts until you develop that discipline. 

Second, if you are indulging in good thoughts ans avoiding bad thoughts, your mental state is therefore wholly affected by thoughts, which you have no control over, rather than your awareness and greater self. You can be at peace no matter what, but if you attach to your positive thoughts you constrict yourself on how much you really are abstaining from attachment, and it will only hinder you in the future.

Return to the breath, always.",0
"There was a post made today by u/godisricardo. Here is the post if you haven’t seen it. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/d90qvv/how_to_meditate_when_you_have_no_privacy_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I have come to the conclusion after cross checking a lot of this guys comments that he is in fact not in a “Muslim” country and he is actually lying about this. If he truly wanted to see how to meditate there are 5 minute Youtube videos. If you read his comments he contradicts himself multiple times and see that he is actually just pushing misinformation rather then coming to this sub to learn something. I am not making this post as an attack but a message to everyone on this subreddit that this is not the place for this. We are meditating to reach our high selves. This isn’t a political or religious agenda center. He is spreading Islamophobia and I don’t see how that is acceptable in a meditation centered group. He is claiming he’s living in a Arab state where he would be “killed” for meditating. It has been cross posted to r/samharris. [Here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/d91ul7/this_is_why_sam_is_right_to_focus_on_islam/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) And I have to disgustingly say these people are pushing a political agenda using meditation and “enlightenment” to bash Islam. I have asked him multiple questions about his responses that are contradicting everything he is saying with clever worded dodgy responses. I believe these people are working in groups and have throwaway accounts to push their agenda. If you don’t believe me you can easily see this guys responses, the misinformation he is spreading, the islamophobia he is spreading, the cross post they are pushing, the vague answers, the facts he is not acknowledging and the opinions he is pushing. Any well educated person can see this for themselves as I wish there is no more of this poor minded thinking. We are here to raise our vibrational energy and meet more like minded people as we realize we are one. One post cannot tear us apart as a community or make it but there is a line of negativity that shouldn’t be tolerated here. I hope you guys can see through this users bull and realize what is the truth and what is not and the moderators will do something good. With that all love and prosper to everyone. I love you all.

"Should we use the word 'should'? What does it tell us? If you 'should' do something then why is that? 

Well we 'should' clean our rooms because organization is important.

We 'should' be organized so we show up in time for work.

We 'should' be in time for work so we can earn a living.

We 'should' earn a living so we can support our family.

We 'should' support a family because if not we will die alone.

But wait. I don't care if I die alone. Some 50 years ahead in a time that does not exist. I might die alone tomorrow in a car crash. I might die in 10 minutes of an aneurysm. I might already be dead and reliving the same moment over and over and over.

I don't care what I 'should' do because it is not what I WANT to do.

I WANT to support a family because they bring me joy.

I WANT to be in time for work because that's an opportunity to make a difference.

I WANT to be organized because it frees up my headspace.

I WANT to clean my room because I'm tired of those same fucking bills staring me in the face for the past 3 months.

"Hi all! I’ve been meditating for a few years now but I am not very educated on it. I’ve been working on educating myself more for the past year, and my aunt who is a yoga teacher and meditation trainer has given me the opportunity to take her 8 week meditation training course starting mid October! each person that takes this course has to read a book on meditation and talk about it at the end.

Recently however I've been meditating about once-twice a day more frequently and have noticed my right side of my mind is feeling really pressured constantly unless I do something to distract the thought but then as soon as I try to relax and meditate the feeling comes back.

"Being a calm and cool person is an extremely special trait which is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the hectic nature of our modern society. When a person is calm, his energy affects all the people around, bringing others an air of comfort and peace by making them feel that everything is going to be okay. A calm person is relaxed, assured, and stable, making him better capable of dealing with stressful situations and solving problems effectively and efficiently. Consequently, he gains the respect of others, is pleasant to be around, and abides joyfully in this world.

Today, I'd like to share two main ways to develop our inner calmness by highlighting how to increase our physical calm as well as our mental stillness.

&amp;#x200B;

**Physical Calm**

Because of our mind-body connection, the condition of our physical well-being has a significant influence on our feelings and emotions. If we can maintain a healthy body, our mind will benefit immensely, and we will feel an elevated sense of joy, calm and confidence, and overall positivity. We must always be mindful of the three basic yet vital aspects of a healthy body and monitor them daily. These three pillars of good health are: eating healthy, resting adequately, and exercising frequently. When we can manage these three things well, we will see a significant change in our mental well-being that in turn, leads to inner calmness. 

Furthermore, it is important to maintain good posture throughout the day to ensure the tension on our joints and muscles are properly distributed and that we keep our body parts in their rightful positions to minimize stress. Whether we are sitting, standing, or walking, our backs should always be upright, our shoulders should be pulled slightly back, and our necks should be comfortably rested with our gaze just a little lower than horizontal. We should always assume relaxed comportment and avoid tensing up our shoulders, jaws, necks, or legs. We can do this by practicing several rounds of mindful breathing every hour or whenever we can remember. We take a deep breath and fill our lungs up with a good dose of oxygen. Then on our out-breath, we send our body into relaxation by letting go of all the tension throughout our body that we have been carrying unconsciously. You can try it now for yourself to uncover just how much strain your body is carrying. After a few rounds, you are sure to feel a little more relaxed.

Every time we breathe in mindfully, we clear our minds of mental clutter and regain clarity of thought. And when we breathe out, we relax our bodies and let go of negative energies and emotional burdens that we've been carrying throughout. Over time, when our sleep, diet, and exercise is well managed, our physical posture is realigned, and we have regained mindfulness of our breathing, we will notice a sharp increase in our body's physical comfort. We will feel calm and relaxed wherever we are, whatever we are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mental Calm**

Because we cannot physically see our minds, it is easy to forget that it also needs taking care of. However, not everyone knows how to care for our mental well-being, and so in many cases, we end up doing things that instead bring it harm and suffering. The first thing we should realize is that our minds are just as delicate as our bodies and is equality susceptible to negative influences. We need to show it as much attention as we do to our bodies.

The first thing our mind needs is our attention. How we feel, what we think, our wants and needs, our joys and pains, we should all be attentive to them, moment to moment. Giving attention to our mental world is called mindfulness, and without this quality, no amount of effort will bring us calm, peace, and happiness. Just as a mother cares for her newborn, never leaving it from her side, we should care likewise for our minds. Mindfulness is another word for deeply listening to ourselves, while maintaining a gentle, kind, and attentive position. This is the highest form of self-love, which, when practiced profoundly, leads to unconditioned joy and fulfillment. 

When we begin listening to our minds and giving it the attention it deserves, we begin understanding what causes and conditions lead to certain effects and outcomes. For example, with mindfulness, we learn that hatred and anger create much stress, anxiety, discomfort, while kindness and open-mindedness lead to pleasure, ease, and delight. When we witness with mindfulness that wholesome qualities lead to inner peace and happiness, we will naturally begin doing more good and less bad. We learn to live life more harmoniously, generously, and lovingly. When we listen to our minds and give it what it wants and needs, we will inevitably develop a deep sense of calm and confidence.

But of course, mindfulness of our inner world may also lead to the discovery of negative emotions, suppressed memories, or even bad thoughts that bring us pain and sorrow. When this happens, we must fight the urge to turn away from our hurting mind, but instead, show it the great care and concern it needs most. The best way to deal with such situations is to realize that like everything else in the world, these thoughts, feeling and emotions are temporary, transient, and have the nature of arising and passing away. With this understanding, we develop patience which is the best virtue to help us manage unfavorable states. With a patient mind, we listen deeply to our pain, embrace it as a mother embraces her baby, and remind it that everything is going to be okay. 

When we develop mindfulness, patience, and wisdom of impermanence, we naturally give rise to great inner calm, because we learn how to create good states, how to manage bad ones, and realize deep down that no matter what happens, everything is going to be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

To realize our inner calm, it is important to establish healthy lifestyle habits, a healthy body, and a connection with our breath. This will inevitably bring a great sense of physical calm and comfort. To cultivate our mental calm and comfort, we must practice mindfulness, which is simply the practice of deeply listening to ourselves. Then, we create positive states by developing wholesome qualities like kindness, generosity, and empathy, while learning to manage negative states with patience and the understanding that all phenomena is conditioned and temporary by nature. 

If we can internalize these ideas into our everyday lives, we will naturally feel a deep sense of calm, joy and fulfillment, knowing that we have a way to deal with everything life throws at us, and at the end of it all, everything is going to be okay. I hope reading this has brought some benefit to you, and I sincerely pray that we all realize our inner calm, peace, and joy.

May we all live happily, healthily, and harmoniously, and work together to create a wholesome, vibrant, and joyful world for our families, friends, and all future generations.

Thanks for reading 😊",0
"I've been meditating nigh on daily (20 mins first thing in the morning) for about 8 months now, and to my surprise I've found the most disruptive thoughts are the positive ones, which generally come in the form of being excited for and coming up with ideas/planning what I'm going to do for the day. While I'm stoked I have this problem (given that part of the reason originally approached meditation with the intent of confronting somewhat traumatic memories) a bigger part of the reason I approached meditation is due to the relationship between meditation the default mode network (the neurological seat of daydreaming/mind wandering).

As much as lurking on this sub has advised me against getting attached to any one sensation, I generally chase the dragon of getting into a state  where I am completely content with sitting there and having no desire to open my eyes and and engage in some random thing be it a random chore/starting my day/part of something I want to do today/do something with my gotdam phone.

I'm thankful that my default mode network is just living it's best life and giving me good ideas of shit to do with my time. However, throughout my life my daydreaming has been a source of chronic distraction and not getting ANYTHING done. I have started many things that could have been amazing if I actually maintained attention to them but instead I get distracted/lose inspiration/bored and leave a useless husk of an idea behind.

How should I treat thoughts that, while not meditating, I *should* sink my teeth into and take advantage of?

Thankyou for reading if you made it through!",0
"Okay guys, first of all I made sure I was grounded and said an Our Father prayer. I know my chakras are out of whack, and was starting with my root chakra. I used this meditation music  with a Bluetooth sleep mask. (https://youtu.be/vCpBSnYBTM0)

I'm breathing and doing well and like I mentioned in the title. That blue eyes thing formed.  And it didn't leave and I looked at it for a long time and then I opened my eyes, and it was still there.  I wasn't afraid until I started really thinking about it.  And then my brain started taking over and I asked for it to go away. 

Afterwards I have had pressure in the middle of my eyebrows.

What the heck did I just do, aww geez.🙄",0

"I think I'm experiencing an issue that alot of people can relate to. A part of me believes people like david icke and joe rogan when they say were really like a frequency, and we really do live forever. That everything is an illusion, and there's things right in front of me I can't see because I'm not on that dimension. But I dont really understand how meditation ties into all that? How does breathing help you gain access to a higher dimension?",0
"More like, modern examples, think (Mark Manson.. etc.) 

Not sure if I'm the only one, but I can't seem to break through this book.  It might be the jargon, using ""pain-body"" every 5 seconds.. (in my opinion).

I'm not trashing the book.  But has any other author touched on the same principles in a different writing style?",0
"So I want to appologise in advance if this isn't where this sort of thing belongs and for any grammatical/spelling mistakes I've just finished work and am quite tired but want to get this off my chest.
 
I'm a care assistant and last friday an elderly man who i have only known a few months but had an instant connection with died during the night he was bed bound and for weeks it's been clear he's suffering, but he seemed to be holding on for his family i believe. On friday he said ""i bet you think it's sad I'm dying"" and i told him, no, i think it's sad that you're suffering, I find that the truth soothes more than a lie like yes but you are going to get better or something like that. That night we spoke a bit but i had a strong feeling he would die.

So during the night I had a dream and his being visited me at first it was just like a presence of him then a body and then he took on the form of his younger self and he had 3 dogs with him (dogs are what we bonded over) we spoke for what seemed an eternity even though there wasn't much actual conversation and it seemed like we were traveling through a void and at some point I told him it's time to let go and he did and he was happy and not scared. 

Now even though i know it was just a dream i still feel some guilt and confusion. Partly because I'm putting some blame on my death down to my conversations with him and partly because I'm worried that if it wasn't just a dream and he did visit me did i rob his wife and family of a visit they could have had? And lastly should i share this experience with them or is it more likely to cause more distress/suffering for the family I'm very fortunate to not of had to experience loss like this before so don't really know. 

does this perhaps belong in astral projection or something. anyway thanks you for reading this and apologies.",0
"Today for a while, I noticed a strong instant distinction between being mindful and not being being mindful. Now I know I have not been mindful for atleast 14 months. Atleast never been fully mindful, or in the way I experienced today . I have been more self concious then self aware because of this fact as well detached and highly Unconcious of life happening around me and have been facing a lot of stress and anxiety(also  newly founded PTSD from trauma  2 years ago). It's as if I couldn't be concious at all..I had so many control issues. I went to a 10 day Buddhist retreat and I wasn't mindful for a single moment.  We kept doing shamatha but I wasn't mindful in Shamatha, just thinking about my thinking (like they told)

Important: Now I know I am used to controlling my breath in an unnatural way from my head that is detaching and depersonalizing from the moment and everything happening around me(and this has become a strong ingrained pattern){makes sense?}.. But the few moments I was mindful, my breath was totally natural working according to its own accord. Is it so? Can someone help me understand why and how this was happening?

I never thought mindfulness is a mind full upto the brim.I misunderstood what real mindfulness is(thought I was being mindful but I was just living in a small part of my head, like it's said,""Some people die at the age of 25 and aren't buried until 75."" And I have been this person for so long."") Not anymore.

But now I know what I've been doing so wrong all this past year. 

The only problem, I can't get mindful again this evening. Idk how I struck upon it but it was magical and I was so much more aware of myself than my continuous anxious thought cycle, I wasnt a victim anymore.
I have to relearn this art.

PS: there might be a surge of energy to my head while being",0
"Pretty much said it all in the above haha. 
Just want to know if anyone else has felt this or any advice would be awesome. 
I ventured into this because I want to be kinder, calmer, more focused and not just struggle to get through my work day but actively love it and live in the moment. 
I use this app to teach me how to meditate and was meditating before work and after work to calm myself down and put my head in a nice headspace before I would go to work. I honestly felt like I saw the changes. I wasn’t engaging in any negative talk about work, I was stopping my need for energy drinks in the morning, I wasn’t so nervous going to work and worrying things wouldn’t work out... I’m sure you get the point. I just thought, wow this is so awesome. I’ve found a loophole in this life! I can do this! 
And then yes, as said above. It’s like I just rejected the morning from the get go. When my alarm went off, I was shaking it in anger. Then I angrily went downstairs, got in the shower and just cried. My boyfriend asked me what was wrong and I said I didn’t even know. He convinced me to have the day off work. Which was very sweet and kind of him. But now not being at work has made me feel even more of a failure. Maybe I held a too higher expectation? 
It may also be that I’ve been having later nights than usual and I have to get up pretty early for work. But it just felt so odd to be tired, mediate and then feel excellent at work these past days and then today... nope. This might just be a whole load of crap I’m writing I just want to understand why.. anyway if you’ve read all this. I just thank you for taking the time.",0
"I was never really a big drinker. However, I did enjoy drinking casually with friends in a social setting. I enjoyed the reduced inhibition it gave me. However, after I started meditating earnestly, I began to pay attention to how alcohol really effects my body. I began to observe how alcohol changes my focus and attention as well as how it feels within my body. After observing these changes, I realized that I no longer enjoy it. I didn't like the feeling it gave me, and the only enjoyment I got out of it was an immediate, short-lived dopamine rush. After that, the negative effects took over. The sluggishness and inattentiveness really became a hindrance to my sense of being present.

Just thought I'd share these insights.",0
"Hello community, I've been meditating for a week now. Whilst meditating I keep repeating breathing in, breathing out in my head.
I've noticed after about 10 min into the meditation I sometimes mumble and say something far off my usual ""breathing in, breathing out"".

Is this usual, a sign of something or what.
I also sometimes feel pulsating and I warm up even though it's chilly.

Am I on the right track?",0
Want this post to be all motivation for those days that its needed and can always come back to!,0
Hi! I’m celebrating my birthday soon and I want to do something for my friends. I was thinking on spending the day outside introducing them to meditation and doing activities to bring us together and make them feel present and disconnected from their daily distractions. Can you help me plan a possible agenda or listing some activities we could do? I’d be really grateful :),0
"Any tips on meditating while you're sick with a cold or allergies? My nose isn't particularly stuffy, so I don't have much trouble with my breath, but inhaling deeply and having a rush of cool air against the back of my throat sends me into a coughing fit. Not exactly calming. I can't even imagine how one could meditate if they were suffering from a stuffed up nose. Other than foregoing meditation until feeling better, what are some ways to get around being sick and still meditate?",0
I’ve been doing really well in my meditation practice these past few weeks. I’ve experienced waves of euphoria several times and other blessings during meditation. Right now I’m experiencing something outside my meditation on a daily basis. Sometimes I’ll be at work doin my thang and all of a sudden I feel absolutely still. I don’t really know how to explain it other than that but it seems as if I am noticing everything in my surroundings moving and even I’m moving sometimes but I feel so still. As if my movements are calmer. Can someone shed some light on this?,0
"Safety first, of course :) 

My initial motivation to start experimenting with driving and meditation/mindfulness (M/M) was to become a better driver. I naturally find driving very boring. Much more boring than all my inner thoughts and concerns and whatever else would bubble around inside me. So to help myself become a more attentive driver I thought of utilizing some of the practices I learned from meditation. 

Specifically:

- *Breathing*: Find where my breath was going and trying to take fuller and calmer breaths. I find this helps on long drives on a highway to sustain attention on the road and environment.

- *Body Scan*: Again safety first - so I found that either before I start driving I can do a body scan to get into a comfortable but attentive driving posture. While driving, I only felt that long stretches on the highway allowed for a sort of parcelled out body scan to defuse tension across my body and develop a better posture.

- *Visual Attention*: I naturally have a sort of tunnel vision in my visual attention which isn’t ideal for surveying traffic situations. I’ve found that softening my gaze and allowing in more information from my peripheral vision allows me to a be a much more attentive driver. I sometimes practice this on the highway but it’s not super useful there. The skill really shines when driving through crowded urban areas cause it allows for noticing and tracking many more people and vehicles all around you at once.

- *Processing*: I’m not sure what the official name is for this in meditation as I am mostly a novice, but I’ve found that when I use all the above plus a sort of calm-abiding mind while driving (again only works on long, boring highway stretches) then I can sort of softly observe both the outer world (and respond accordingly when necessary) and my inner world (a sort of meditative practice). It’s not nearly as good as just meditating and doing nothing else but maybe it can be? I don’t know.

So that’s what I’ve figured out so far. What are your thoughts and experiences? Ever tried this? How far could you take it? Did you feel it helped you become a better driver? Could you access a meditative state while driving safely? :)",0
"I am sorry to bother you guys due to my ignorance, but I can't find answers to what I'm experiencing anywhere. I was meditating about 8 minutes ago afor at least 10 minutes. About 5 minutes in I started feeling my energy rise and somewhat violent vibrations. There was no pain, but I had the feeling that if I continue I was going to give up the ghost and leave my body. I wasn't scared, but it's safe to say that I wasn't ready for it. I opened my eyes hoping that it would subside, but it didn't stop until I started physically moving. The sensation was about the same as feeling 3 billion bolts of electricity running through my body, but without the pain. I started to just let it rock, but its almost impossible to be perfectly fine with being struck by 15 lightening bolts and feeling you spirit lift up from your body and transcending consciousness lol. This is the 2nd time I've had this happen, ever. Does ANYBODY have advice or know what went on? Should I have kept going? Am I going crazy? Perhaps. I'm going to take a shower and go back in to attempt to figure out ""where"" I was going. Help is appreciated and much love 💕

P.S. I've been meditating for a year, but seriously just started back today after a 4 month hiatus.",0
"I came to the realization today that maybe my ego has prevented me from being happy all along. I don't know, but it sure is scary to think about.  I like to think that I have it in check but it's checked me. I went to one BJJ class and didn't go back even though I wanted to. That's just one example of many of me folding when things get challenging. I can't face the fact that I may be less awesome than I make my self out to be. It's just as scary to think that I might be stronger because if that's true then it's ALL on me. Sorry if this doesn't make sense, as I am sleep deprived.",0
"I've been meditating for 15-20 minutes every morning for the past 3 weeks.  First thing in the morning after I brush my teeth and wash my face I go and meditate.  I've been doing mantra meditations mostly.  I am confident, Everything will be alright, I can do this, etc. With a little bit of just focusing on my breath mixed in.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've started I feel more in control and aware of my emotions.  I can recognize what is causing me to feel sad or happy easier and almost immediatly.  However, every emotion is more intense.  I've never felt anxiety before, but for the past week I have been a ball of nerves and I know exactly why.  I have a crush on someone and Im pretty sure she likes me back, but it would be a pretty bad idea to date atm, but thats beside the point. The point of the post is that I don't like this anxiety.  I don't know if I like feeling everything more fully even the good stuff.  I just did really well on a project and brought extra value to my team and feel super proud about it.  Idk if I have felt prouder about something before.  And even that good feeling, feels almost too intense.  Life was easier when it was duller.

"The great cosmic joke is that you are what you are seeking. 

All the religious and spiritual seeking on this planet and you end up back where you started. We all look for happiness, peace and fulfillment in the things of the world, yet all along these things are our very nature – our very own center of being. 

Every single thing you imagine yourself to be is a clever lie constructed by a psychological defense mechanism against the existential truth of transiency.  In other words you are not who you think you are.

""I laugh when I think how I once sought paradise as a realm outside of the world of birth. It is right in the world of birth and death that the miraculous truth is revealed. But this is not the laughter of someone who suddenly acquires a great fortune; neither is it the laughter of one who has won a victory. It is, rather, the laughter of one who; after having painfully searched for something for a long time, finds it one morning in the pocket of his coat.""

"Is it possible, through patient and experienced meditative practices, to explore one's own unconscious?

Forgive me if this question sounds stupid, ignorant, or uniformed ... but I'm really a neophyte in this area and striving hard to learn. I understand and appreciate meditation can evidently bring about a great deal of emotional benefits in the form of relaxation, stress reduction, so on and so forth. What I'm mostly interested in is finding some way of “discovering myself” – I want to meet the *real me*, deep down past all the layers of ego and psyche I've wrapped about my core to mask and hide who I really am. Does any of this make sense? I feel almost as though I need a vision quest of some sort, to find my true self and subsequently set myself upon a path toward positive growth and spiritual enlightenment. 

And it recently occurred to me that perhaps I ought to inquire about meditation. I realize I might perhaps require training and a great amount of experience and effort before achieving any sort of “breakthroughs” ... but is this sort of thing possible, and if so, what manner of meditative traditions or techniques would it be most wise for a person in my situation to pursue to better dive past the self-critical conscience mind and into the depths of the basic, subconscious core of my own identity?

Novice here: I usually meditate at my desk everyday same time. Today I had to attend a meeting. During the meeting I just watched my breath the whole time. I was listening but was attentive to every inhale/exhale. Does this count as meditation?,0
"Im new to meditation, recently was my first time and i did it for 22 minutes. I enjoyed it so much that i want to just meditate all the time now. my question is, can you meditate too much? Can i do this like 2 to 3 times a day?",0
I got pretty upset and was crying a lot tonight and wanted to meditate before bed to calm myself. I found it really difficult as I couldn’t help but get caught back up in those emotions. I started crying again and the meditation kind of broke off at that point. How do others handle strong emotions when meditating? I’d really like this to be a technique I can employ in those tough moments.,0
"Everybody always says “you need to change your mindset”. Which I agree is super valuable, but how?? Like what specifically did you do to worry less and be more confident?",0
"For example, how would you handle a situation where someone states an opinion or feeling of their own which differs from your own. I find that sometimes I have an emotion towards this and I struggle with understanding that feeling the intense emotion isn't bad and that just because I may feel a negative emotion doesn't mean the person's stance is inherently bad or harmful. Take the case of my significant other and I, she said she feels like she might not want kids and that she's been thinking about whereas I do later on in life, this caused an emotional reaction in me because I'm worried if we do reach that point, it's something to worry about even if her stance or thoughts about it change. 

I accept that this is her feelings about it, and I can't change it, I have been breathing more and letting myself feel the emotions and be very aware of it and why I feel that way, how do I make sure I am not unfair to her feelings or not understanding. Maybe I'm just worried about this too much? 

What's a healthy way to deal with these things? I try to be aware but at some point I have a thought where it's saying I'm disconnected from my emotions and her just because I am trying to be aware and realize I'm not my emotions. Is it normal to feel a little disconnected when you are able to separate yourself from the emotions you feel? Is this bad? I have so many questions",0

I made it about 4 or 5 days but was surprised that even when I woke up feeling ok, and the 5 minutes went well, I would still find myself crying after.  After those few days the idea of trying to meditate felt like too much of an emotional weight to take on.   I've never experienced this before, and really wasn't expecting the 5 minutes to have this effect on me, as I'm generally a very positive and happy person. Is this common?  Any advice?",0

As you all on this subreddit probably know, there are many different light and healing love meditations and ceremonies out there. Some of these meditations will help manifest the most positive ascension timelines for humanity. The above link is one very effective mass meditation that, if you take part in, will surely help move our planet closer to a timeline of world peace. Please give it a chance and try it out. You can do the meditations on this site, even if it is not the exact time of  the meditation schedule. There are also many other different mass meditations on the home page of the website I linked.

The following two links are a few free pages about how to do the merkaba meditation (recreating your human lightbody)-

And this is the updated version straight from the book:


https://imgur.com/gallery/0TJgwTB


This meditation, if done while feeling love energy, will release negativity and blockages from your chakras and open them up, thus restoring proper energy flow in your body, and improving your health. It can also change your consciousness to a higher dimensional awareness of peace, love and harmony with all life everywhere.


I highly suggest giving this meditation a try. Here is a guided audio link on YT of the merkaba meditation:




https://youtu.be/81Kf3UBQ1g8




Its from the book ""the ancient secrets of the flower of life part 2"".  The book also teaches spiritual anatomy of your 13 chakras,  healing, psychic powers, how to cast out entities/demons from your energy field, how to reconnect to mother earth,  the cosmos and your higher self,  and talks about a few intergalactic conspiracies and the current great awakening!


Here's a few pages from the book about the Lucifer experiment and how we can stop judgment and transcend this duality:

Here is another very useful meditation called the unity breath. It goes hand in hand with merkaba meditation. It will allow you to tap into a stream of infinite healing love energy:

"I've been practicing mindfulness meditation for 4 years. Over the last month or two I've developed two of the following physical sensations:

* A constant feeling of pressure in my head as if it were a balloon overfilled with water
* Occasionally, my head and upper back want to fold forward 90 degrees spontaneously. They hang as if I were a rag doll. It feels good to be in this position but it looks bizarre from the side.

I have hypotheticals of there being like body memory or trauma within me that wants to be expressed but I have no idea really...

Has anybody experienced things like this? Any ideas on what might be happening?",0
"* Meditate same time everyday, this will help you slip into deep meditation quicker. 
* Try to eat light before you meditate
* drink alot of water before your session.
* Keep your back straight, if you feel it slouching straighten it. 

If your shooting to extend your mediation sessions to 30mins to 1 hour, to 1 hour to 2 hours, etc - Pace yourself. Each day hold your meditation longer and longer.  


After weeks of consistent meditation(keep in mind, you have to do this at the same time)  you should be able to get into a deep meditation(samadhi) within 30-40 minutes. You will fall in and out of samadhi deepening on how long you are going for.   


Hope this helps someone",0
"I've tried many times, and I just could not ever end a session feeling like I did what I was supposed to. I felt like I never actually ""meditated"" before. It was only today that I finally understood what meditation is about. Usually when meditating, one of the basic concepts is to ""focus on the breath"". **focus** being the key word here. So Everytime I meditated, I tried my hardest to ""focus on the breath"", and come back to it if my mind wandered off. I found out this was my problem. 

I use the Headspace app, and almost every meditation session, Andy (The narrator), starts off with focusing on the breath. After a little while, he tells you to ""let your mind wander"" for just a couple seconds. Well something I noticed several times (That I guess never clicked in my head), was that I realized that the more I focused on my breath, the harder it was to do. It was like by focusing on the breath, I was RESISTING thoughts. Whenever he would say ""let your mind wander"", that's when I felt most calm and like I didn't have to give any effort. When I focused on the breath, thoughts kept flying in everywhere, and it was near impossible to focus on the breath. When it was ""let your mind wander time"", I realized those thoughts that kept trying to come in, weren't anymore (At least no where near to the same degree as when I focused on my breath). And therefore there was no more resistance. 

Just today is when this realization clicked in, during my Headspace session. After it was over, I realized that I need to just let my mind wander the ENTIRE TIME. I'm not going to ""focus"" on ANYTHING. And I realized by doing this, I felt a sense of freedom, and zero resistance, and I wasn't ""attaching"" to my thoughts that were coming in anymore. All this time and I never got it. Now I do. Excited to have more sessions and see the benefits now!",0
"When somebody reads enough about meditation and other peoples subjective experiences, one is bound to stumble upon many people describing lights, absolute bliss, one-ness, spiritual hallucinations and other things, that everybody is told not to chase.

But I desire such an experience. I am not sure if I'd believe in whatever I experience, but it would be a lie, if I didn't want to **feel** one-ness, all encompassing blissfull light, spiritual or religious stuff and so on. At least once.

After reading like 20 of such experiences, I ""see"" them everywhere. Whenever I have a good meditation session (just watching the breath and going back to it over and over again) where my chattering minds shuts up for a while and I 'kinda' see white points, my mind goes into a hyperactive ""Oh boi, here it comes, here it comes, don't get distracted, watch the breath, ah, it's over, just back to the breath.... Ah! It comes back! Nvm... just back to the breath....""-mode.

Which means I'd likely never experience something like that. Can't really change that, but the bigger problem is that my mind starts something like this whenever I am having a good session... it feels like a hindrance that degrades a good time... But I can't let the expectation/hope for such an experience go.... after all, it would be incredible interesting to experience something like that...

I've always enjoyed the silence of libraries and the soft sounds of typing and hushed chatter. In an act of sheer luck I happened to think to sit down and decided to meditate in the library and this kind of environment has done wonders for my practice i am able to sit for hours at a time now, I know meditation can and should be done anywhere but having a place to go specifically for my seated meditation is akin to going to a gym to work out it gives you a sense of purpose for being in that place to preform your act undisturbed I've also discovered going to different libraries in different towns is also fun. Every town has one of these dojos if you have struggled to develope a steady seated practice I urge you to grab a seat in your local library and try it out.

"i’ve been practicing mindfulness meditation for about 3 months and have been practicing consistently every day for about 3 weeks now. i’ve noticed that i’m able to get deeper into very relaxed states quicker as i practice more. today i reached a state in which my body was totally and completely relaxed. in this moment i truly felt like i was observing my thoughts from a third person point of view. my brain was jumping from one thought to the next with no breaks in between. it was like listening to my inner voice just chatter away to itself. at some point i felt my mind cease to think- and my body literally felt like it was floating. for just a couple of seconds i felt pure bliss. then i heard the sound of my dog’s collar jingle as she entered the room and a thought entered my mind again. i tried to picture the thought as a cloud in the sky and let it leave my mind but then immediately after that another thought followed it. and another. and i noticed the pattern. i had the epiphany that - holy shit, my mind is actually thinking like this for hours upon hours every single day- this is its normal state. it’s insane. our minds are constantly making up things and repeating them. i tried to get myself back into that state where my mind was free of thought but every time i tried different thoughts would pop up. it was like my inner voice wouldn’t be quiet! lol. this was also the first time that i experienced myself wanting to stay in meditation longer than usual. normally i set my timer but today i did not and instead of coming out of my meditation i decided to stay for several more minutes in this relaxed state. ironically whenever i awoke from my meditative state the song playing on my phone was titled “feelings come and go like clouds.” i’m curious who else has experienced something similar to this. i’m really excited about what i experienced and i’m eager to keep practicing. hopefully i can get myself back to this “thoughtless” state and enjoy more of it. it was truly wonderful. namaste :)",0

"I've recently started reading Dune from Frank Herbert, and the lessons from the book so far draw so many parallels to my lessons in meditating. As of yesterday's session, I've been going through my breathing patterns and noting emotions and thoughts. I also see that focusing on breathing, rather than on restlessness and sleepiness, help my mind. But, the strongest comparison comes from the quote, ""Fear is the mind-killer."" From this one quote and trying to get closer to clarity of mind, I can finally see myself smiling in the mirror and noticing the little things in life. There is additional quotes from that line that talk about facing fears, and overcoming it, which I thought to be Camus-esque. But, it also is a lesson from my meditating. Whenever I find my mind working 500 thoughts a minutes, I take time to think of my thoughts as cars passing by. There is no tension.

"Hello peeps!

I'm a curious person who likes to learn about different techniques and different philosophies so I decided to sign up for a TM talk/presentation.

This is my experience of the TM presentation at their office in my City. 

A lady sitting behind a laptop, under a projector screen presentened TM to myself and 2 other people. 
They show you a tonne of slides of the health benefits of it. Scientific evidence -  including EEG scans and lots of other brian wave stuff. Lots of graphs showing the benefits which I found to be extremely vague. I pointed out that they didnt say anything about what the sample size was, what questions were asked. They didnt mention how long the participants had practiced or any details. The slides just showed an increase in this or a decrease in that.

After all their slides about different parts of the brain I asked if they had any studies about TM and the default mode network. They said that this area is very active and lights up during TM.


There was also a slide section comparing different meditation practices -  it really felt like they were slagging on all the other types. 
They suggested that mindfulness meditation acted on certain parts of the brain (the ones they mentioned earlier that were associated with sleepiness I believe) and they differentiated Vipassana meditation as the ""direct focus"" kind and that it worked on a different part as well. They mentioned compassion meditation as well but none of these other types changed the brain as much as TM does. TM was different b/c it gave your brain something to do and also gave you the ""transendental exp"". 


After just over an hour long talk they slap you with the price tag. 
$1310 CAD which includes 2 1on1 lessons. They also mentioned you can come back anytime to ""tune up"" your TM. 

I know I sound cynical...well that's because thats how I feel. I know very little about meditation so it's very possible I missed something or am confused.

"Hey Everyone, I'm new to reddit but I figured I would give this a shot. 

Context: I moved for work about a year ago and ever since then I have been over analyzing everything and comparing myself to others. On top of that I started seeing this girl a while back, we ramped things up really quickly and I fell for her really hard even though I knew she was moving before we started seeing each other. I know realized it would not have worked out in the long run. Ever since then she has been on my mind.

Everything else in the grand scheme of things is going really well. I have hobbies, been doing new things, been going on trips, meeting up with friends, etc. When I'm keeping myself busy I'm ok, but once I'm on my own I start to ruminate and overthink.

Do you guys think that anyone can guide meditation and organize a meditation group? 

Should the guide be experienced in meditative practices or can they be relatively new? 

Should they have a rigorous personal practice or can they not meditate at all? 

Will a meditation group be productive if it lacks a diverse array of people along different places in the spiritual path? Common thought has me believe that meditation groups need a teacher who has been far down the spiritual path...

It makes it hard to focus or be at peace when I feel it hard to breathe as I am not getting much air this way. Does anyone have any tips to help with this? It would be much appreciated as meditation really helps me with stress but this tension is making it hard to relax while meditating",0

"According to the site. Edgar Cayce knew he would die before his sons returned from war. If he wanted to ""avoid death"", couldn't he have just stayed in the astral plane? No living person now has (openly) come close to the abilities that Cayce possessed and I believe if anyone can completely untether themselves from the physical world, it would be Cayce.",0

Let's get some Headspace together. Just a few minutes a day can reduce your stress and help you sleep better.,0
I’ve been doing a meditation course on the app Headspace and I used to be able to enter a fully relaxed state concentrating only on the breath. It was amazing. But lately I’ve not been sleeping 8h/night and I feel like I can’t focus properly because my mind starts wandering like if I was dreaming. Is it because of lack of sleep? I’ve read that when you don’t get enough deep sleep your brain’s dream necessity starts flooding into your daily activities.,0
"I just completed my first 20 hours of total meditation time with a 20 minute session and it was such an incredible experience I wanted to share. 

I started meditating before sunrise so the time would end just as the sun was hitting my window. During the last half of my time, warm tingling energy started radiating from my heart outward filling my body with my breaths. It filled me with so much peace. Like a new layer of my mind opened that I could just melt into. 

I then transitioned into wishing love, health, and peace for my son and partner and the tingling got stronger and stronger. 

Has anyone else experienced this? 

I’ve never had an experience like this before. 
I’m just having a beautiful morning sitting here in the soft glow of the sunrise and thought I’d share ✨😊🙏",0
"Often at work, but sometimes at home too, when I know I have a lot of things to get done, I really struggle to stay mindful. There is a lot of inner conflict and tension within my body which urges me to rush and get through things as quickly as I can. This increases when I know I don't have enough time to get the things I need to do finished.

When I return to the present it feels very unpleasant and my mind is quickly pulled back into creating stories about why I have so much work to do, who's fault it is, fantasies about what I could do next etc.

What's the best approach here? Just keep coming back to what I am doing over and over? Try to slow down and move more smoothly? 

Just looking for any advice or discussion about your own experiences here.",0
"I’ve been meditating for about 18days now (25 sessions- 249 minutes).  My typical practice is roughly 10-15 minutes daily in the morning. I have meditated later in the evening on some nights, and the most I have meditated in one day has been 46 minutes. I sit on a zafu in a zazen position. I’m currently using the sattva app to guide my meditations. I want to experience finding my third eye. I guess my question is how should I focus my gaze to open this shakra. I feel that if I’m looking towards the spot on my forehead that I’m almost feeling like my eyes are going cross eyed.  Am I trying to hard? Should this not be my focus? I do focus on the breath, and often times have pressures between my eyes during/after meditation.  It’s something that I’m honestly “eager” to experience.  Does anyone have any tips, or feedback for me. 

“Inhales energize the body, exhales relaxes the body”",0
"I understand that a variation of this question has been asked many times, however I am hoping to be more nuanced in what I am experiencing when I ask this question: Is it possible to get worse at meditation as you go on?

Some background: I started meditating about 3-4 years ago nearly every day. I started out with zazen and have tried other styles including TMI, Shambhala, and some self-inquiry stuff. However while I remember experiencing very brief cessation of thoughts and emotions (and it was a crazy positive experience), I distinctly remember feeling the waves of my emotions and being able to categorize them as they came and went. I could clearly feel different emotions and reactions my body experienced. Compared to now where I feel that I am struggling to even identify any feeling I am having and when asked a question such as ""bring your awareness to your heart and listen to what it's feeling"" I cannot feel anything. Prior to this (maybe two years ago) I was able to do this quite easily and could immediately sense my experience. 

I am extremely frustrated with my practice, but not to the point where I feel terrible about this. After all, at this point this practice is simply a part of my life at this point. Positive or negative feelings aside, I feel that overall it has benefited me. The concern for me is whether this is simply a ""stage"" in the journey or if I am actually doing something wrong and training my brain in an incorrect way. I appreciate any insight people can give me. Thank you all so much.",0
"Has anybody meditated for a long time if so, by being in the present moment always did it affect your health negatively?",0
"In 2 months, I have an entrance exam which I decided to give my all in. The exam is for 3 hours with no breaks in between. It consists of 100 questions. Basically, there's no time to breathe. My case here is, I am able to do well for the first hour of the exam before my stamina and focus start to fade away and I can see that in the results. The exam is broken up into 3 sections. I get 99 percentile in the first section and then start decreasing to 90 and 80 in the later sections. It's not that I can't answer the questions. When I analyze the test I've written, there were questions I was able to answer that I left, or I made a silly mistake in the ones that I answered. I've been through a multiple of these tests now, and this has always been the case. Through constant feedback, I think I now know what's the real problem here. It's not the skill but the focus to persist. 

Also, 2 more things to add: 

1. During the exams, through section 1-3, I know my focus is not 100%. I've been thinking about other things that randomly pop up in my mind which I think I'm unable to control. My ex cheating on me a year ago still haunts to this date, adding to the mental strain and distraction. 

2. I know there are apps for meditation that can be helpful, I've tried. It works for a day or two, and then I forget about it and I get back to the same old self. 

I need a 99.xx percentile overall to clear the exam. With 2 months left, a bit of advice on helping me focus would be of real help and it's much appreciated.",0

"Two years ago I had a very bad emotional breakdown.  I had acquired PTSD from a relationship with a woman who dumped me.  I needed therapy, I'm still in therapy - but the most wonderful gift my therapist gave me was the suggestion to meditate.  He didn't tell me how to do it, he just suggested I learn on my own - as it will be part of the healing process.  So I did.  I looked into Buddhism, Hindu traditions and breathing techniques, mindfulness.  It was a struggle at first.  My ego was still eating away at me:  ""Why me? Why doesn't she love you anymore?  I love her so much, I need her! What am I going to do?"" Two years later, I look back at it all very differently.  Sometimes we just need a catalyst in our lives to spark something beautiful, to push us in a new direction.  Meditation helps with so many issues.  When we clear our minds of thoughts, clarity ensues.  The real truth comes out.  I never understood the term ""love yourself"" - and now I completely understand it.  Love and light to you all.  Meditation works, never give up.",0

I've decided that I want to give meditation a go, however I'm not quite sure how to start. I don't want to set an unrealistic goal, instead start small and build up.

"for a long time i felt like i wasn’t “progressing” very much in my practice. i felt like whenever i would sit down to meditate i would find myself intellectualising about everything i experienced. i became frustrated that i couldn’t stop doing that. but today it was as if i just accepted that that was a part of me—that i will find myself intellectualising about my experiences. which lead me to a second insight.

i often use the Waking Up meditation app, outside of my normal practice. and Sam Harris often says “pay attention to the breath from the moment it starts to the moment it is ends.” or “pay attention to the moment a thought arises” that sort of thing. and i was again sort of frustrated for the longest time that it seemed my conscious awareness of something only occurred a few moments after it had started. i would find myself thinking about something without even knowing how the thought began. i think i realised more that i’m just watching things happen. there’s only an illusion of control that somehow occurs, but when i pay attention i can’t find any. even so far as the accepting of these parts of myself seem out of my control. i couldn’t force myself to accept them, but through lots of practice it just spontaneously came about one day. 

it’s all very confusing.",0

"I learned in my one class that nirvana is essentially “feeling/watching” both positive and negative emotions go by without attachment and that it is pure bliss. To me tho, that kind of seems scary, doesn’t it? Learning this made me question meditation a little bit. Is the goal of meditation to be able to deattatch from negative thoughts to be able to focus on positive thoughts? Cuz to me, that would be nirvana. When you deattatch from positive AND negative thoughts, that seems borderline depressing and that seems like one would just be emotionless in a bad way. I also don’t understand how you can go without attachment from both without repressing emotions. Say if you have reached a very high meditative state in your life and someone close to you dies. How would one who has achieved such a state react in that situation??? Because the way I see one reacting to that is emotionless and that seems terrifying. 

A lot of questions in this post, an answer to one would help me better understand meditation!!!",0
"So I have picked up meditation recently and I have found myself more clued in and in better moods. I feel much more calm and clear.

I am curious though. I have a long history with a dysfunctional family. I have had to cut off close family and friends (even cut off my brother) because I feel like they don't respect boundaries. I would say a significant chunk of my negative life events have come as a result of being a ""nice guy"". As a result I almost feel sort of guilty for being cheery or upbeat. Sometimes I catch myself with a slight smile throughout the day.

I am almost scared that if I am seen in this light or I see myself in this light I won't be able to standup for myself.

**does meditating make you passive? less able to standup for yourself?**

My intuition is that the answer is no. Unless you hold ridiculous new agey spiritual beliefs that holding anger against someone is wrong. Which I don't at all. I think meditation could make one submissive if the individual uses it as a form of escapism or the individual firmly believes that harming others under any circumstance is wrong (which is just silly)",0

"I do 20 minutes twice a day just focusing on maintaining a clear mind, keeping steady and centered. My biggest obstacle while meditating is my focus ""falling asleep"" and getting distracted by thoughts. Instead of being defeated by this, I simply stop thinking as soon as I remember my objective, and try again. I don't expect to be able to maintain 20 straight minutes of a clear mind immediately or soon. But I'm giving this thing a year to see how it goes. A year without skepticism, just observation. And one thing I have noticed it does seem like the practice I get putting the brakes on overthinking while meditating has made me less apt to overthink during the rest of my day. I also noticed I now can sense when I am tense, and make an active effort to relax and release tension. In retrospect I couldn't even tell the difference between being tense and relaxed. And I've been tense a lot... for a long time.

Once friends had called 911, I immediately started meditating, focusing on my breath and “noticing” everything going on around me. I of course took the painkillers provided once the ambulance arrived, but meditating for that five or ten minutes while waiting allowed me to stay pretty calm and not focus my energy on fhe pain.

"Yo, I recently got back from my first 10 day vipassana retreat. I had done 3 Zen retreats before, but omg this was so much better!

I can’t believe nobody ever told me how different Vipassana meditation is than other meditation techniques! I was mind blown when they taught it to us on the fourth day. It’s not so easy to describe, and you probably can’t learn it without doing the 10 day course, because they teach techniques step by step that build on each other. 

**So what is this great unique technique?** Awareness of sensations in the body. It’s not just “body scanning”. You put your awareness on a body part and stay there till you feel sensations. They feel like buzzing vibrations, almost like little pieces of sand flowing around. A myriad of other body sensations can arise as well, but mostly you isolate your awareness on each part of the body feeling these sensations, and then you sweep them throughout your body. 

The point isn’t to feel sensations, it’s to remain equanimous despite whatever pleasant or unpleasant sensations you feel. Supposedly these sensations have something to do with the unconscious mind, and thus you’re reprogramming yourself to not react in craving or aversion.

Their retreats are free! They aren’t a religion (although, it’s definitely the teachings of the Buddha).   No bland meals like in my old Zen retreats, you get a tasty vegetarian buffet. Go find a Vipassana center near you and learn this amazing unique meditation technique!!!!!!",0
"Hey guys this is my first time posting but something weird happened last time I meditated.

There was a black woman in a long flowing white dress, her eyes were white, and all of her was just floating effortlessly. She came up to me and asked,
“Do you worship me?” I told her yes and then she ate me... it wasn’t painful of like how you normally eat food it was like she was pushing me inside of her and merging my everything with hers.

"I'm relatively new to practicing my mind and I noticed something interesting while narrating myself- like interior dialogue. I noticed that while I was questioning and answering within myself, I heard a second self blurt an answer simultaneous to my own self. This was both surprising and not surprising. 

I've been wittingly practicing my mind for quite a while, but I've only recently been able to recognize/appreciate minds' eyesight and I think I overdid it. I was caught in what felt like ""rumination"", but it wasn't any single looping thought, it was just that I couldn't close my eyes with seeing ""everything"".

I've recognized this ""second self"" far in the past, but never had I recognized it within my mind, as it had only expressed itself external (like me just saying something to myself, out loud, that I did not wittingly say.). I was surprised because it was the first time I heard a voice in my head that I can say without doubt, that ""I"" had no influence over what the second self said. When it spoke, it ""felt"" strikingly different, yet a part of, what it felt to be where ""I"" am- meaning, what I attribute to the ""thinker"". 

Later that night, my head was swirling with imagery and I began to feel like I had simply allowed negative entities passage. I felt like I experienced the tip of what could be madness. My head was pulsing until I was able to relax it. I didn't sleep until dawn and only for a few hours. It was a good lesson learned.",0

so is this a sign that there's underlying anxiety i need to work through? like built-up stress? or is it not a big deal and i should just try again tonight?",0
"Let me start by saying that I do not by any means have any infinite answer nor have I found the depth of what mediation can be. After reading many stories on this thread, I believe that at this point I desire to express the impact it has had and what it has brought me in just under one years time, in effort to help others. 

First, I meditate two times a day, morning and night, 20 minutes each time. I meditate with some time of ambient noise (fan on low setting) along with a very downtempo mix from soundcloud (check out slumber sessions). I sit, I have a two syllable mantra, and breathing is and has always been my main focus. 

Much like many others in this group, I could go on and on about the impact that it has made, but in effort to keep this short(er) and concise, I would say that meditation is what I would compare to a LONG IV drip for the mind. You may never feel it right away but the impact comes over time. 

There will be bad days.

There will be days where you sit and have so much thought that your mantra is drown out, breathing seems impossible,  and that any time sitting feels like an eternity. 

There will be days where you just don't have any desire to sit. 

There will be hours spent feeling like this may, in fact be a waste of time.  

Keep going. 

Continue on through the days where you don't want to participate and even if you don't feel it, stick it out. 

Because there will be that one day. That one time you open your eyes and the world feels a little bit different. 

That day where you will be swept with so much emotion that sobbing mid-mediation is the only option. 

That day where you're sitting in a situation and you feel the ability to be present, to not control the flow, but to exist in the moments between. To recognize awareness, knowing that the next thought is temporary and will not take away from this moment. 

The point is don't suppress what comes; instead let it come and simply let it go. 

When you take away the desire for the result, you begin to open up the awareness that allows you to become one with it. 

You will never find ""it"" but you will know when it has found you. 

In conclusion, try to minimize expectation. Commit to it if you feel like it has a place and serves a purpose.  And nurture each moment you can recognize. Whether a feeling of good, or bad. Address it. Let it have its moment and when you do, you will find room for so much to enter when you stop letting past of future events cloud up the present. 

Personally, I know that I'm only getting started and I know that I am going forward in the direction I am, because of meditation. I also know that IF I CAN DO IT, ANYONE CAN. 

It isn't easy, and it takes a bit of determination. But keep it simple, if it finds a place in your life, embrace it, explore. Above all, be yourself and live at your own pace.",0

What were the teachings that the spiritual teachers in all times and places wanted to convey to us?
Although today we are now able to recognize their teachings easily and accustomed, we are immersed in the profound and form of the words of the old way of teaching, passing by without knowing what we need to know.

In the movie ""The Matrix"", the main character Neo is offered the choice between a red pill and a blue pill by Morpheus.
The blue pill will allow him to go back to his life without transformation, be satisfied with the existing reality and believing in what he has believed so far.
On the other hand, the red pill will allow him to he has a chance to realize the truth of the essence, become a true master of his world and become truly free.

Like Neo, you are standing at the crossroads of your life at this moment.
Maybe you have a vague fear or disdain about choosing to realize the truth of the essence.
But if you want to escape from the existing reality, if you want to fill your life with true satisfaction and happiness, you can choose to realize the truth of the essence.

When you realize the essence, you understand that the truth you've been looking for is yourself.
And you understand that you have the power to be free from all the pain, that all the possibilities are on your side.
And now, in this moment, you have a complete experience of being truly free.

The choice of this moment now is the most important first choice given to you.
The choice of this moment now makes a huge difference in your life.
If you postpone the choice to the next time, the choice disappears without returning.
Maybe this is the last chance given to you, hope that miracle with the chance not to scatter will follow you.",0
"I'm often terrible at sticking with things, so I'm pleased to say that I'm nearly two weeks into daily morning meditation and it's going great.

Although I have meditated about 60ish times (according to my mindfulness app) over the last year, I'd still consider myself a novice. I've been using the Calm app, which has great weekly and 21 day programmes. 

Meditation is a great way to combat waking up in the morning with the usual haze of stress and anxiety; I feel at peace afterwards (albeit for a short time) and the techniques I've learned have helped me approach typical daily problems a different way.

Anyway, that's my story. Wish you the best with your own journey.",0
"I have very low willpower to resist cookies, desserts and breads so I have failed a lot with my attempts to eat clean.

If you want to know more about this, you're welcome to watch this short video I made: https://youtu.be/S1N9d5h3bGQ

I hope my journey inspires or helps someone. But keep in mind you have to set your OWN healthy eating goals. What's worked for me may not work for you. All the best!",0
" Hey [/r/meditation](https://www.reddit.com/r/meditation)!

We all know that meditation is not an antidote or a quick fix to be used in the moment of bad experience. It's a regular practice that slowly helps us handle these moments when they arise.

However, I wanted to kick off the discussion by asking;

In a moment of intense emotion (e.g. overwhelm, anxiety, anger), do you have a standard procedure of getting through it. As in, ""When I get anxious, I first do this, then this, then this....""

I personally have a method I go through and would love to put it into a post/graphic (and possibly even an interactive feature in Guide) but would love to read what you all do. I'll edit this comment with my method once the discussion gets going.

Thanks and I look forward to the great discussion!

"After reading about Kirtan Kriya meditation and how it helps slow, and maybe prevent, Alzheimer's, I've been practicing it most weekdays for the past couple of months. The thing is, the past couple of times, I've dozed off mid chant, even while still doing the finger movements.

"I just wanted to share! I’m absolutely flabbergasted. I did not think something like this was possible. My lower back has been screaming for the past few days due to an irritated psoas(I think). It has really been bothering me and getting in the way of me being able to focus on work. I just did a ten minute guided meditation. And afterward I noticed a massive decrease in lower back pain. 

I want to make it clear that I was not meditating to help with the pain. The pain had nothing to do with why I meditated. It was just a regular old daily meditation. 

I hear time and time again that some pain can be due to us “holding onto something” or stress, or whatever, and I’ve never really bought it 100%. 

Perhaps through this experience, my mind might be changing. 

I just wanted to share this for anyone who is dealing with pain. I know it can be a hopeless and intrusive experience to be dealing with that. I’m not saying it can cure all pain, but maybe there is some hope for some relief.

One final thing to note. This meditation was an uncharacteristically “fruitful” meditation, I fell right into a nice state, was not too distracted, was able to clear the mind somewhat better than usual. Maybe that has something to do with it. Who knows!

Namaste! Peace and love",0
"I have been practicing meditation for a few months now. A few days ago I got this profound clarity in my mind. My mind was still chattering, but I could observe the thoughts effortlessly. I could catch the thoughts at the beginning itself. I was confident to let go of  my thoughts. My mind wouldn't wander even if tried to make it wander. And I felt like all our worries were absurd. 

I was like this the whole day. But the clarity was gone the next day. I just wasn't confident enough to let go. What was this experience. How can I make it permanent. Can someone explain?",0

" We think meditation or any such practice will give us relief from the uneasiness of what we do not like or find irritating, confusing. It is only when you see that this uneasiness can not be thrown away from the mind that whole energy is concentrated here. 

Body and brain require food and sleep to recharge. This is sufficient, complete in itself. You are essentially at peace, at rest unless you are in immediate physical danger. Unless you recognize this fact-any practice, device as meditation and so on to bring peace and control is to seek relief by running away from what you do not like. Energy remains dissipated.  
 Q. - I have done meditation, read spiritual books, read your posts-but the discomfort does not go? It surfaces in one form or the other.

One essentially feels discomfort when one faces ‘what one does not like’. The discomfort can not be undone or removed or thrown away from the mind. If discomfort goes, life goes. Once you come to this, can you bear the discomfort and see the emergence of action. The whole energy is here.

Now one understands, sees the whole process-the discomfort stops troubling you. What you want or want to do in any situation becomes clear. You are in the limitless field where nothing stops, nothing stabilizes.",0
"I’m very very new to meditation. I’ve only done a couple serious sessions, ~5 minutes each. Usually what I’ve done is I’ll close my eyes, focus on my breathing, and try to imagine myself in a sort of space. Like surrounded by stars. Then I try to imagine the actual place I’m in at the moment, and then changing my surroundings into space and stars until I feel like I’m floating a little.

Does this have anything good to it? There probably isn’t an answer to this, but am I meditating right? Is there anything real to what I think I’m doing?

Also, what recommendations would you make for me?",0
"Been meditating two years, but inconsistently (2-3x week instead of daily). Now I'm trying to become consistent and have been for a week or two.

I realize how much happier when I'm able to catch my unawareness, and getting sucked into bad thoughts especially when I'm stressed or negative. I even understand the concept of thoughts and how we don't have to follow them.

But I can't seem to recognize the times I'm unaware, which is the idea of general mindfulness. I still get caught up and even if I recognize it (like saying ""oh that storyline again""), I can't seem to stop the inertia of the thoughts sometimes (ie recognizing I'm lost, but still going along with my thoughts).

Is there a type of meditation that will help with this muscle more or will it just take more time with consistent meditation)?

And any other practical method from people who have mastered not getting lost in thought off the pillow?",0

"For those of you that have had a major realization that began the true process of tearing your world, both physically and mentally, apart, how are you coping with reality now? I’m talking the real deal, a nuclear explosion that annihilates everything, that there is no going back from, not just emotional releases or big life changes that cause deep emotional reactions. Mine began when I saw Maya, the illusory world, with my physical eyes for the first time. Think Matrix. That was some scary shit and now its all I see. My eyes have never been the same. 

After settling in to my new paradigm small layers of the self began to crumble away because now that I had experienced that the outside world wasn’t real there was no place for the ego to hold on to. Some pieces left with an alleviating sense of release and others with the pain of being doused with acid or skinned alive. The big ones lasted for days or weeks sometimes and brought a loss that is very hard to explain other than calling it a personal death full of grief and sorrow. And they are still coming. 

Only now the layers are going deeper and it seems like my mind is melting away now too, just like the perceived physical world. My brain no longer functions the same as it’s became hard to think. I can only actually observe the process now that it has began and though I feel I made it happen with my strong meditative work I’ve lost any sense of control and it’s all falling away on its own now. I’m truly just the spectator of what seems to be total madness. 

The hardest part is dealing with what feels like a loss of sanity and general functions of the mind. Has anyone out there ever experienced anything similar? If so, whats your life like now? How are you coping with this total loss of the perceived idea of mind, reality, and self? I’m well aware that there is no self, but it’s hard to exist here as the observer while watching it be ripped apart and your mind melt away into goo. 

The free fall just goes deeper and deeper into nothing.",0
"I wanted to share with you guys what has been my experience with my meditation practice so far:

For the past 17 years, I have been meditating on and off (ego-flex) and recently have accidentally stumbled upon the vipassana type mediation.  It seems like everyday, with each meditation, I discover yet another emotional pattern that I was completely unaware/ ignorant of.  I am constantly astounded to find these flaws in my unconscious emotional programming that I wasn't and simply couldn't have been aware/ conscious of before.  This is the part of meditation that, to me, has been the biggest paradox.  You can't be aware of the unconscious thoughts you are having today that may be brought into conscious awareness during tomorrow's meditations.  This is why taking the time to sit quietly and listen/ look/ perceive/ feel inwardly-generated stimuli has been so meaningful to me in all areas of my life;  You cannot fix what you are not aware of, and each ""epiphany"" presents a new possibility to change/ modify your habits in the direction of happiness.  I'm starting to really enjoy this whole phenomenon of discovering sensations and emotional thought patterns I was completely unaware of.  I'm sure tomorrow I will discover new patterns that are currently going on within my mind today as i write this and will then take joy in the humbling process of being continually confronted with my own ignorance.  Sometimes it hurts my ego to be confronted with my own flaws, but I'd much rather find out about these flaws via meditation and force myself to change than to be stagnant and refuse to grow.",0

On average though I feel like I become present for maybe one or two deep breaths before I'm off on some tangent. Sometimes I can relax by thinking about equanimity and at least keep my thoughts of aspects of my external life but this is far from focusing on simply breathing and sitting behind your thoughts rather than in them. It plays on my mind during meditation that I am so bad at it as well.

During the rest of the day, I'm more often than not thinking through some day-dream and sometimes people start and finish talking to me and I have no idea its happened.

Next I try to See, though with my eyes closed. I'll attempt to recreate the image currently in front of me (in my mind) based on what my eyes last saw. Then I'll Feel, by highlighting every sensation I can (every point my body is resting or sitting on, temperature I feel, airflow, etc.). Next I'll Taste, by recreating whatever I last ate in my brain. And last I'll Smell, though since there isn't often a pungent smell nearby, I will recreate one a noticeable one that I encountered that day.

"I've been meditating for a few months and feel so many benefits but today I hit a real bump in my emotional/spiritual journey. 

I got a migraine and I spiraled down into my dark place.  I started to feel very depressed (a label I have been given in the past by psychiatrists) My thinking was that the work I had done was for nothing because what I was feeling now was the same as I did months ago. I was ignoring all the days in between and how many days I had really flourished despite the sturggles I was facing. 

It's really hard for me to fathom how quickly and easily I went to my pit of dispair. I even meditated today during the pain and tried to detach from it but I just couldn't.  

I finally took a T3 and now I am mainly out of the dark pit but it's left me wondering how much is because of the physical pain and if it is mainly to blame then why?  I understand that I was identifying with my thoughts and so on.

I see this as an analogy of meditation.

"Today was my first experience of a long, formal sitting meditation. I went on a half day retreat at a zen centre. We had two 50 minute sitting sessions in addition to walking meditation. I am used to 5-10 minute sittings so this was quite an experience for me. Unfortunately, my mind wandered throughout each sitting. I tried to focus on counting my breath to no avail. Towards the end of the sittings, my back ached so much in addition to my legs in the half lotus position. I had to uncross my legs and sit up
straight with my feet dangling off the chair. 

I think one gain for me was the elimination of disturbing intrusive thoughts like things at work that really bother me. My mind still wandered today while sitting but it was more of a happy wandering (like being at the beach).

I’m not sure how to further eliminate wandering thoughts at this point except to recognize a thought train when I see it and not get on board for a ride. Also maybe try listening more to guided meditations.

Any further suggestions on reducing wandering thoughts and dealing with pain in the body while sitting? Thanks.",0

"Hello, 

first time poster here

So I've been meditating on and off for a couple months now and tonight (30 mins ago) I felt an urge to feel good and feel like a child would feel (light, fresh, stress free, happy, content) so I sat on my bed in a Burmese position. Listen to some Tibetan bowls with my earphones so I could block outside noises (noisy family haha).   
Tried focusing on my breathing. A short while after i began to feel a light pressure between my eyebrows (third eye?) but I just let it be. Then, a weird body sensation took my focus away from my breathing and third eye to old memories.  


When i was little and had high fevers like +39°C (+102.2°F), before falling asleep, I would get this very discomforting and weird sensation in my body. I would feel my body inflated and shrunk at the same time. I have absolutely no words to describe such sensation, not even similar sensations to compare it to but I'm trying the best I can, so bear with me.   
I would feel like my soul was sinking inside of my body, more like my consciousness. My limbs would feel very large but at the same time I would feel myself very tiny inside of them. I would also get this weird taste and texture in my mouth. The only thing i could compare it to would be like synesthesia even tho I'm not sure what it feels like (I think I could feel a texture with my palate and smell)   
I could snap out of it at will but after a while I could feel it creep in again so falling asleep was very hard and discomfortable.  


So while meditating, I got the same sensation but not as intensely or at least, it wasn't uncomfortable. My body felt very big, specially my head, but not heavier!   
I would love to know if anybody has had a similar experience and if it's common 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : was meditating and had the same body sensation like when I had fever when I was a child",0

"Let me just say that I’m fairly new to meditation, about a year on and off and only really do it when I need to. I see a lot of posts on here that all talk about “awakening the third eye” or seeing this place called Maya and so on. Honestly, I don’t want to get there. Don’t get me wrong I love meditation as it’s helped me tremendously with coping with anxiety and stress by just taking a step back for a couple minutes but Im just not really into the spiritual aspect of it too much and would rather not go down that path if possible.

Is there specific meditations I should avoid for this?
If I meditate for a long enough time is this “awakening” something that I will have to deal with regardless? 
What is “awakening” and maya?",0

"So I have tried to get into meditation for some time now, and unsuccessfully.  I finally decided to give mindfulness a go(again) and after going a week straight felt something with it that I felt the first tangible benefit.

I've been a little stressed today, and didnt sleep well last night.  I sat down to meditate, closed my eyes and have any of you ever had that wound up feeling that you felt like you were ""swaying"" side to side but in reality you really arent moving? I had this at the start, but kept at it. Slowly that sensation subsided and left me just with an overwhelming calm I haven't felt before. 20 minutes later now sitting here typing this I really do feel great.

I know this may not be a new thing from most of you seasoned folks, but I have always been a person needing proof. Well I really feel like I got my proof today and I am definitely onboard to keep this up and see what other benefits I can find!",0
"Hi all. I've been meditating for a couple of months now, but not every day. I believe it's going to become a lifelong practice for me. However, I seem to be having some trouble staying comfortable long enough to finish my meditation. My meditation sessions will run from about 18-40 minutes. Somewhere in there. Sometimes I get deep into meditation and I don't really want to come out. And as such, I'd like to get your recommendations on staying comfortable. 

I started out trying to do what the monks do, just sitting on the bare floor. It's just too hard. So I then switched over to what some of the other monks do, which is to sit on top of a couple of pillows. This helped out a lot, but I still have an issue with circulation to my right foot. Towards the end of my meditation, my right foot will tingle and go to sleep. I hate that any time it happens. But as you know if you start shifting around trying to get comfortable, it starts bringing you out of meditation. Then it may take awhile to get back in as deep as you were. This is not ideal. 

If I meditate in my big comfortable recliner chair, then I can usually avoid the foot and leg discomforts. But since it's a recliner chair, I can't really keep my back straight. At least not very easily. This leads to me starting to fall asleep during meditation. Can't have that. So I'd just like to hear what you guys do, and your recommendations on how to stay comfortable enough to keep meditating for extended periods. I'd eventually like to get to the point where I can meditate all day long and not really notice that time has passed, similar to what a Yogi can do.",0
"Hello friends,

I am new to meditation. I am very anxious person and feel like I say/do things slightly based on external factors (trying to impress people, trying to paint a certain image of myself to others etc). I want to be true to myself. I think meditation is the first step towards this and I have felt progress  occasionally. My problem is that I don’t really know how to do it. E.g I search 30min for a guided meditation on Youtube and put the responsibility of having ”succesful” meditation on the guided meditation... Sounds weird maybe. I also don’t breath/inhale naturally, it almost feels like a task.

I hope some of you with more experience can help me with this. Should I meditate without any guidence/music? What tactics are there that I can use in the beginning before it starts coming to me naturally.

Than you in advance.",0
"Hi. I’ve been meditating for quite awhile now on and off. My longest everyday streak was a month back in June. Around that time, I felt vibrations all over my body probably once or twice, other then that I really just followed vipassana. I picked up the practice again about a week and a half ago and I’ve noticed my meditations are a lot stronger/sharper and I experience waves of euphoria about 8 minutes in. This has happened 3 times already. These waves are not just body vibrations. They come in waves and I feel it on my brain. It feels similar to taking pure mdma. I feel super cozy like someone just put a blanket over my brain. Anyone else?


I also wanted to add that I have been practicing r/semenretention since the beginning of the year. It could be that I’m transmuting my sexual energy as well.",0
"
I’ll preface this by saying I experimented with a lot of psychedelics many years ago. Does anyone else who has experience with psychedelics find that the realm we enter in deep meditation is remarkably similar to the come up of a trip? Or even people who have not tried any psychedelic drugs?

It feels almost like a mild dmt trip. 

..doors of perception open up, and you stop filtering so much sensory input..

The experience is completely different, but I feel like I go to the same place

Any thoughts welcome",0
