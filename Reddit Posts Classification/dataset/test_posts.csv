"I love meditating it gets me into a deeply positive and focused mindset. It allows me to collaborate with my thinking and allign my thoughts or directions where I want them to go. I tend to do this when it's quiet but I come across a few suggestions, some people tend to have some background music like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4Jbys\_sWAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4Jbys_sWAI) 

Do you recommend it or now and if so why? I want to start getting to new levels of focus but I want to find out from your personal experiences.",0
How can you practice mindfulness without seeking a result when you know it makes you happy?,0
"So I went through a really bad breakup.  I wasn't in a good place when I started the relationship and I got attached to this guy and was incredibly insecure. The breakup was terrible, I became obsessed with wanting answers and trying to fix it. This is a tendency of mine I forgot to be mindful of this time around.

But I finally did it. It's difficult to explain, but I let it go. I let him think whatever it is that he thinks of me. I accepted that our path was meant to end here. There is no need to fix it, no need to explain, no need to control it anymore. And this letting go has ""transferred"" itself into everything else as well. And one funny thing is that my rather chronic shoulder tension has been melting away. I'm able to simply sit back and observe and allow even if there is still lingering sadness. It's so much more peaceful, now.",0
"I was playing csgo ranks and since I'm absolute dogshit at  the game I died and got super mad and broke my $75 headset. I have broken so many things now i cant even count.(i get mad not just at games). Usually when i tell my parents ima use my money to replace it i usually say it was just getting old or it just broke on accident. I don't know what I'm going to say to my parents now cuz this is the third headphones  I've broken. Other ones I got mad at cuz they wouldn't work. Can anyone offer advive?

I see the posts from the ""political"" friend all day every day. I was just sitting here scrolling through and found myself getting angry. So much so that I almost threw my phone. No idea why I'm getting so mad about this, but it's very real. So, that's it.",1
Meditation is making me more egoistical.,0
"I also don't know how to cope with it. I am nearing that age of graduation where you are supposed to be close with your family but for me, situations arose which broke bonds. My grandmother who has taken me on trips and gave me some nice things for my birthday decided to be utterly rude towards me and my mother. Claiming that my Mum can't raise me properly, I never talk to her during the school year, and I am a failure as I can't find a job. She has always been condescending towards me, treating me like a subhuman with the mental capacity of a peanut which led me to not talking to her a whole lot. I still felt obliged o be all good to her because she took me on trips and drove me to Model Un conferences. But after yet another conversation of Grandma being rude and even going as far as to say 'You are going to wear a dress and makeup on your graduation night' my Mum said that we needed to cut contact with her. So now I am left with no closure to tell Grandma how I really feel about her and left with pent up anger from all those years of snooty remarks about me. I would love to have some closure but I can't seem to have it and now when I am alone I burst into angry tears and even burned photos of Grandma and I in them.

Some coping advice would be welcome.",1
"I think I'm starting to develop anger issues it's completely out of my control and not in my character. It's so Random and out of the blue feeling it feels like there's no pre-warning. Yes I'm already in therapy and I have a psychologist they all know about it already but are not seeming to help , I'm also already medicated. 

A little bit of a backstory, my whole life I grew up being abused but I was docile and quiet I was kind to everyone around me. Then I was in 3 abusive relationships back to back , I was also kind and quiet and tried to do everything in my power to love these people, now my current partner who is not physically abusive, we have issues arguing. It was fine for about a year and then all of a sudden I started to get really nasty, telling him to off himself, telling him I hated him, telling him I was better off without him even though that's not true all sorts of things it just feels like it's coming out of my mouth without control. I have physical and mental disabilities so at the time I was on quite a bit of medication and I started a new one and went into what was thought to be Mania, suddenly I started hallucinating and I started trying to take the wheel and drive us off Bridges , I would hit him I would scream, I would try to kill myself almost on a daily basis I was in the hospital all the time and then one day I snapped and tried to stab him , days before I pulled a machete out, there were holes in the walls from me stabbing them I had even stabbed through my own hand without feeling it from how angry I was. I wasn't on any drugs other than marijuana, no drinking either. Eventually I snapped and when at him with scissors I believe with the full intention to kill him , but I was really delusional at the time so I don't fully remember why he really didn't do anything. The cops got called and I went to jail , once I was done hallucinating and out of that mindset I just couldn't believe what was happening it was traumatizing. I took myself off of all the medication , and I got better stopped smoking pot a little bit better. 

Now my concern today is, I think it's starting to happen again and I thought it was medication-induced it's pretty much my worst fear for this to start happening again and I'm scrambling to figure out what to do I'm getting suicidal I would rather kill myself than hurt him. I snapped and hit him yesterday I was so angry I was literally almost blacking out, I haven't felt that way since I took myself off the medication which was about 6 months ago everything has been pretty normal since that happened and now suddenly this is happening again, I wielded a knife in my hand screaming at him and eventually snapped myself out of it and now I'm just so so scared I can't afford for this to happen , I'm finally getting my life together I'm going into college soon to become a psychologist I'm working off community service to get that charge dropped I've been doing really well on my new medication I don't know what's going on",1
"I can’t believe I’ve been so angry today. I just left the store in raised my voice to the managers because there was a long line. When I saw that I and others were waiting so very long and there was only one cashier I went back and talk to the manager and other coworker. I told him there was a long line and they went up to the front and I was raising my voice saying this is happened time and time again in the store and I’m really getting tired of it. Then at the door everybody was saying thank you and I said here’s the crazy guy raising his voice leaving the store but you’re finally being taken care of. Why did I act so crazy? Why couldn’t I just have told the manager that there was way too long the line and just left it at that. Why did I have to raise my voice like that crazy person? Now they’re going to remember me next time I go in. Why do I do this?

I’ve also been yelling at my kid because he lost something that was very important today. Why am I doing this? Why am I so angry? Are you even woke up and tried to say some prayers and this is what happens? This is what happens?

Am I bipolar like some people accuse me of being? Do I need help? Or is it just my anger?",1

"Hi there,

I have long suffered from anger management issues and I'm realizing that I really need to do something about it to live a better life and to be happier on a day-to-day basis.  For what seems like forever, I've always had very little patience and a quick fuse.  I'm constantly fuming if I'm driving and I'm stuck behind another car, seething if something delays me, or angry if someone disagrees with me at work (internally, not outwardly so).  There are times when something happens and I just snap and see red, for example, my girlfriend dropped a full coffee pot by accident and I yelled at her.  I apologized and we are doing well (engaged, actually), but I want to get a handle on these outbursts and have more control over myself when I am angry.  I was hoping someone could suggest some good places to start or some good advice.  I realize that a lifetime of this isn't going to change overnight, but I want to do what I can to see real progress in controlling my temper. 

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.",1
"So for the past few months, I completely stopped meditating. I used to do it twice a day every day for about a year straight, but I ended up stopping a while ago and have tried to start meditating again, yet quickly find myself extremely bored and tiresome, and often think that I could be doing something better with my time even though I know it’s not right. 

I’m trying to avoid meditating while in the process of doing it, but I want to start meditating for up to 20 minutes morning/night every day again, does anyone have any similar experiences or advice on how to resolve these issues? Thanks",0
"It is almost like an addiction. When I'm playing an online game and I get killed or think the battle is unfair I will insult and swear at people. Sometimes I find it funny just to insult someone if they were annoying me.

The worrying thing is it sometimes spills over into real life. This morning I almost lost my footing on the pavement and swore out loud in front of strangers before I even knew what I was doing.

I am angry as fk in real life. I am normal, fit and in shape and don't hate myself (i think) but have struggled to get proper employment since graduating and spend a lot of time doing nothing. I think the isolation has mentally destroyed me. I am bitter about it working so hard at uni and in jobs and I can't move on with my fucking life. Also most of my friends moved away for work or just moved on in life so I am isolated with no escape. I go to social clubs but it doesn't help much.",1

Has anyone been through this here that can provide some insight on defusing your inner anger or how to start regaining respect and trust with your SO?  First time poster, please help.  Thanks.",1
Im trying to calm myself down but im having a hard time every small situation that can be solved so easily and inconvenience that settles down after a while from my family turns into screaming and exaggerated reactions which I hate deeply just a while ago something similar happened and I know it couldve been just a conversation but we ended up screaming again I hate that part so much I wanted to avoid the screams and be rational but its so tiring to always 'understand' I have this daydream that when I get a decent job ill enjoy seeing them suffer in a financial crisis I wont be helping them at all Im glad I hate them,1

"Hi beloved sisters and brothers, I’d like to share with you a video I just created that definitively explains what God whom we concentrate on during meditation is using a logarithmic spiral: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-OuIr0fgbI&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-OuIr0fgbI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR03LpkdJ0k1N4tXf5SJB_VtFrFbXYf0k6GrPpHG1vXU0NWsoNCTtT41Rhc)

Script:

""God is ever-present and unchanging.

Life is the phenomenal universe and perpetually and exponentially growing oneness with God.

This can be compared to a logarithmic spiral, a shape commonly found in nature.

God can be compared to the origin, infinity.

And life can be compared to the spiral, which can be seen as a folded wave.

God, oneness, and Truth are complete peace and infinite love, just as the origin is the Heart at which the wave's amplitude approaches zero and its frequency approaches infinity.""

Full text from my site:

“God is ever-present and unchanging.

Life is the phenomenal universe (maya in Indian spiritual philosophy) and perpetually and exponentially growing oneness with God. (Beings who’re more one with God than humans are, such as the Creator, beings to whom worlds are thoughtforms, solar systems like atoms, and humans like cells, goddesses and gods, angels, legendary, celestial, magical, and other supernatural beings, extraterrestrials, and spirits, exist in higher and more majestic dimensions, such as heavens. Beings who're less one with God than humans are include animals, plants, and minerals.)

This can be compared to a logarithmic (equiangular) spiral, a shape commonly found in nature.

God can be compared to the origin, infinity.

(The origin is the center point that the spiral converges towards,

ϴ → ∞ using the polar equation r = aeb(-ϴ))

And life can be compared to the spiral, which can be seen as a folded wave.

God, oneness, and Truth are complete peace and infinite love, just as the origin is the Heart at which the wave's amplitude approaches zero and its frequency approaches infinity.

(We perpetually and exponentially grow towards Godliness, oneness, and our true Self and Heart, becoming nobler \[dedicated to universal, world, and inner peace\] \[complete peace, zero amplitude\], and stronger \[infinite love, infinity frequency\], like a logarithmic spiral perpetually and exponentially approaching its origin.)”

Something goes off in my head and I cant controll my anger,1
"Ever since I was young I had anger issues. I knew it, my family knew it, but my friends and others outside my family (aside from the really close ones) didn’t know. I did my best to keep everything bottled up, as I know how I get when I’m angry, and I’m scared to let that out, and for the most part it has worked. The downside, however, is that because I bottled everything up, people took advantage of me and saw me as inferior. I’ve lived like this since middle school (I’m 21 now) and have grown tired of it, and I’ve been trying to break out of my shell. The problem is that I got into a scuffle today, nothing happened because I held myself back, but I haven’t felt this amount of rage in a very long time, and what infuriated me even more is that the other person continues to insult me by speaking to me in a demeaning tone. Honest to god, I wanted to beat the shit out of him. I approached him and wanted to talk, but he threatened to fight me halfway through the conversation. I’m a rather muscular guy with some experience in martial arts, so there’s no way in hell I’d lose, but I still held myself back. I don’t know what I should do, I’ve never come into contact with such a toxic community in my life (it’s not JUST the person I had a problem with) and I can’t move out of here until January because of college. I’m still pissed off but I was able to let some steam out at the gym, but on god my blood was boiling. I’ve never wanted to hurt someone so bad in my life, and I have no idea why his ego is so big to the point where he’d insult me like that. To him and his group, I have kept my distance, and treated them with respect even with them screwing me over, but I just don’t understand. I can’t fathom why they think they’re invincible. I can’t even fight the guy because I’m fairly certain he’d report me after, I’m in a rut, and I’m so fucking pissed",1

"*""The point of meditation is not to discover some cool techniques to occupy your leisure hours; it's to make the simple but momentous shift from doing to being. Don't make the mistake of turning your meditation practice into another urgent item on your list of things to do. Use it, instead, as a welcome oasis from doing, an opportunity to be, without strategy or agenda. In other words, keep it simple. Play with a few of the techniques at first to decide which one feels right for you; then stick with the one you've chosen. It really doesn't matter which method you use - they all end up depositing you in the here and now.""*

"So a lot of the books that I see on amazon about anger seemed to be targeted towards people who direct their anger outwards and explode.

How do you remember important ideas/realizations when you’re meditating?,0

I don’t want to stop the meditation to write it down or focus on the idea too much so that I’ll be more likely to remember it. Kinda seems like I’m stuck with just hoping it’ll stick.

Edit: thanks for the input everybody! You all gave me a lot to consider.",0
"When I was younger, I had a horrible temper.  While I was younger than 8 or so I would throw huge temper tantrums. Screaming, crying, flailing around on the ground, and throwing things. But, people don’t put up with that for very long and little kids should learn how to handle their temper in a different way by the time they’re 8 or 10 so I got in trouble for tantrums and I’d just hold it in and cry sometimes.

When I hit puberty, things hit the fan. One day my older sister, who can be emotionally abusive/manipulative at times, was making me angry while I was putting dishes away and I just lost it. I know that I wanted to make her shut up, but I didn’t know what I was doing. It’s like I closed my eyes for a second and then opened them to see my mom shoving me away from my sister and both of them yelling at me. They thought I was gonna kill her because I was holding a knife that I had been putting away. I didn’t want to hurt her. 
Around a year ago I was alone with my sister and she made me feel so angry I blacked out again and when I came back, she and I were hitting each other and she ended hitting me to the ground. I don’t know what actually happened, she’s been known to exaggerate, but she said that I was trying to strangle her and she had fought me off. 

Why am I blacking out? How can I stop it? I’m going to go on testosterone soonish, and I wanna know why this happened so that I can learn to control myself before I get a temper boost from the testosterone. I don’t want to lose myself and actually hurt my sister or anyone else.",1

One Life Changing Question Everyone MUST ask Oneself https://youtu.be/-67Qxy_3Yhs,0
"I've been meditating nigh on daily (20 mins first thing in the morning) for about 8 months now, and to my surprise I've found the most disruptive thoughts are the positive ones, which generally come in the form of being excited for and coming up with ideas/planning what I'm going to do for the day. While I'm stoked I have this problem (given that part of the reason originally approached meditation with the intent of confronting somewhat traumatic memories) a bigger part of the reason I approached meditation is due to the relationship between meditation the default mode network (the neurological seat of daydreaming/mind wandering).

As much as lurking on this sub has advised me against getting attached to any one sensation, I generally chase the dragon of getting into a state  where I am completely content with sitting there and having no desire to open my eyes and and engage in some random thing be it a random chore/starting my day/part of something I want to do today/do something with my gotdam phone.

I'm thankful that my default mode network is just living it's best life and giving me good ideas of shit to do with my time. However, throughout my life my daydreaming has been a source of chronic distraction and not getting ANYTHING done. I have started many things that could have been amazing if I actually maintained attention to them but instead I get distracted/lose inspiration/bored and leave a useless husk of an idea behind.

How should I treat thoughts that, while not meditating, I *should* sink my teeth into and take advantage of?

Thankyou for reading if you made it through!",0
Total chaos!,1
"A little bit about me, I was diagnosed with depression this year once I realised that I was getting sad a lot more frequently with it being more pronounced. A lot of it stems from bring an emotional kid (crying EVERY day over the littlest things) and being told to just stop crying in high school or I'll get bullied.

So, I did just that and bottled up all my emotions for the past 9 years, with me just about to finish uni this semester. However, this year I've been losing all my distractions that have let me ignore my emotions, as I'm no longer enjoying my studies which has forced me to confront my actual feelings.

Unfortunately, for the past 9 years I've got it stuck in my head that showing any emotion is a weakness. Any form of vulnerability is a weakness. Standing down from your views (no matter how wrong) is a weakness. And thus I have become so much more defensive and instead of simply crying, my first response to anything I don't agree with/anything that upsets me is to express myself with anger and then cry.

I have hurt my family's feelings on so many different occasions with my outbursts, saying things I don't mean but strangely feeling a need to stick by what I said because ""I don't want to be proven wrong and back down"". Even today I had a disagreement and called 3 of my family members idiots, even though I couldn't properly come up with a coherent sentence. Like, I know what's going on in my head but I can't tell them properly coz I'm getting upset and angry. In turn, I feel like they aren't properly listening or understanding what I'm saying and are just using any attempt to belittle me. 

Was I in the wrong for calling them idiots and making them upset with me? Of course I was. But I can't apologise to them coz I've got too much of this stupid pride in not wanting to back down. 

I feel like every argument I'm having with them is fracturing my relationships with them, but I just can't stop. I constantly think that maybe it'd be best to move out of home even though I have next to no money because I'm hurting them. But in the same token I am twisted in thinking that I should move out as that will hurt them too. I don't really want to hurt them, I love my family to pieces and I know they care for and are worried about me, but I don't know how to stop getting angry all the time. I just don't know what to do.

Sorry for the rant, I've just had a very emotional day today.",1

A lot of things have been going on lately to make me pissed. This morning I lifted weights and it was a wonderful and terrifying experience.  I usually feel a little pain while lifting but this morning I felt none.  The workout seemed really easy even though my heart rate monitor I was wearing said it was 175 bpm.  I don’t know what it was at the end of the workout because the strap around my chest holding the heart rate monitor in place fell off during my last set.  Luckily I didn’t hurt myself and didn’t let myself lift more even though I wanted to. Not sure if this is the right sub for this so if it isn’t I apologize.  Hope everyone is having a good morning.,1

I've always enjoyed the silence of libraries and the soft sounds of typing and hushed chatter. In an act of sheer luck I happened to think to sit down and decided to meditate in the library and this kind of environment has done wonders for my practice i am able to sit for hours at a time now, I know meditation can and should be done anywhere but having a place to go specifically for my seated meditation is akin to going to a gym to work out it gives you a sense of purpose for being in that place to preform your act undisturbed I've also discovered going to different libraries in different towns is also fun. Every town has one of these dojos if you have struggled to develope a steady seated practice I urge you to grab a seat in your local library and try it out. They are wonderful for finding peace and they've been right under my nose all this time, if you have a special meditation place of your own that youd like to share please do",0

Additionally, I've heard many teachers say it gets better over time, which makes it sound linear. But I've been meditating for 5 years and sometimes I have good sessions, and other times I cant get present to save my life (which I feel like I should be able to do at this point).",0

Will meditation teach me about me? I’ll admit I don’t know who I am. I lost myself in a 3 year toxic relationship and I’m trying to find myself. I don’t recognize myself. I have low self esteem. I have low energy and motivation all the time and there’s always something inside that keeps me from doing what I want. Will meditation help with creating myself? With becoming more aware of myself and who I am?,0

"I didnt really know where else to share this so im putting it here. It happened a few years ago when I was still experimenting with meditation, just like any other one of my sessions. I dont really recall why or how it happened, but for maybe a few seconds or maybe even a minute, I experienced an intense pleasure that I cant describe. All I remeber is that it felt really good, not like temporary pleasure, but rather a deep fufilling sensation. 

I have never been able to replicate that sensation, probably because I was consciously trying to achive that state, but I really want to get back into it once I have more time. If anyone knows what that, ""state"" is, can you share more information on what it is and how it works. Im intrested to know more about it since I havent heard many people talk about it before.",0
"19M here and I posted about my anger problems on here before.  Since 1 year my life went downhill and my day consist of playing video games and going to the gym. I am basically the typical ""loser"" you'll meet. I live with my parents still.I never wanted this for myself and I wanted to do better, but to no avail. I used to get angry about my current situation and break stuff and punch walls etc. One day recently I was getting really angry about something,I shake violently when I get angry and I feel that I was about to pass put because of the fast blood flow etc. I took a deep breath and told myself this ""It dosen't matter"". This changed me, now when I am close to getting angry because thinking about my dark future I just say this and accepted that there is nothing I can do about it. The key to get rid of my anger is accepting my fucks ups and just thinking it doesn't matter now. I still have trouble falling asleep at night or morning because I lie anxiously awake and cant sleep, but I got control over my anger part. I am not happy but not angry too, which is much better because I thought my heart was going to explode because of the stress. I found a way to get rid of my anger and I am kinda proud of it!",1

"I have a problem... 

I work in the male-dominated industry of security for a Fortune-500 company. I have a problem, I don't like being told what to do by my male co-workers and I tend to argue with them a lot when they try to control me because of my mere womanhood. I will never ask for the help of another man unless it's my supervisor or another female. It's just an issue I have with my co-workers when they try to be controlling for no reason; we all get paid the same. I am also a few years older than them and some of them are immature to me. I know they probably think I'm a bitch, but I'm trying to make a point that I can not be manipulated or taken advantage of. I set solid boundaries with men at work and I speak up if there is an injustice. Some of the men at my job have slept with other co-workers, flirt with them, etc. I want them to know that I can not be fucked with. 

Overall, I realize it's unprofessional so what can I do to avoid losing my temper? How will my co-workers view me after losing it sometimes - not all the time.",1

"I have been meditating quite successfully for about 2 years now. Simple mindfulness meditation, concentrating on the breath, acknowledging thoughts and letting them go. I use it to calm my mind and, through that, to relax my muscles which tense up whenever my thoughts are too many and too chaotic. With that, I have a very reliable sign and meter for my mental well being - if I meditate enough, I can be almost relaxed; if I don't, things get tense and painful.

Now for my question: After about 15 minutes there often is a moment when I forget to watch my breath and thoughts and get swept away in some daydream. When this happens, it is accompanied by a peaceful feeling, a calm mind (not empty though) and a noticeable relaxation of the muscles.

I enjoy this a lot. But isn't this kinda the opposite of what we are trying to achieve when focusing on the breath and letting thoughts pass in order to have fewer of them?

In the first 10 minutes I would actively recognize upcoming thoughts, label them, return to my breath. While this in itself feels good, it also feels a bit like work. I'm still doing something, focusing. And then the real freedom seems to come only when I fail in being mindful?

What do you all think of that?",0
"4 nights ago, I went through the most terrible insomnia. I must have laid awake in bed for 3-4 hours before blessed sleep took me.

The next day, Dad told the whole family that someone forget to lock the doors at 4AM (Dad was travelling and only reached home at that hour). He was so angered by the unlocked doors that he went to everyone's rooms and turned on the lights, intending to find the culprit.

Thankfully, he didn't lose his senses, and upon seeing that everyone stayed asleep despite the brightened lights, he opted to leave everyone be, and then he went to sleep himself.

I was infuriated when I heard that he went to my room to on my light, and that he had half a mind to wake me right there and then. I kid you not, I might have went berserk at him if he had woke me up.

For some weird reason, this thing has weighted heavily on my mind the past few days. I keep imaging the scenario where I was awoken at 4 AM, and how I would have punched him out of sheer rage. The dumbest thing is that this situation didn't even happen. My sleep-deprived brain thankfully kept me asleep despite my dad's actions so we avoided a nasty confrontation.

Why do I feel so much anger over something that didn't even happen?",1

"I'm starting to get sick of this problem for a while now, usually 2 years ago I would embarrasingly deal with anger by screaming my lungs out and banging at my crappy 5 dollar keyboard. But ever since I got a high quality keyboard I had to stop, so I thought of an idea. The keyboard is expensive but, I am a hot headed prick with little worth. so I started biting my arm in frustration, but only to leave a mark and not bleed. In rare cases though where I get pushed over the edge scratch myself until it starts to bleed. I just realized now that I've become a danger to myself and i've realized it made me act more of a piece of shit to my concerned family whenever anger blocks my reasonal thoughts. Which in turn goes in some fucking cycle where its just Get mad&gt;hurt self&gt;family tells you to stop warning you of serious problems&gt;sarcasticremark.mp3&gt;concerned family leaves room&gt;feel like a piece of shit&gt;hurt self&gt; repeat. normally this wouldnt even happen but then, I found a genre of games .IO games. I can only explain it as like drugs or smoking you know its bad for you, you want to stop but you can't your mind forces you to just go PLAY PLAY PLAY PLAY and its driving me insane! They always go it's not that addicting just stop playing but it's not that simple to me. To me their advice is go cold turkey on digital fucking heroin! You people gotta help me please, I can't pay for anger management since it's too expensive and I don't want to be a leech taking money from their wallet for therapy. This subreddit is my only hope of figuring out how to end this habit

crap forgot to mention I don't have this problem on most games just games that are pvp and IO games",1
