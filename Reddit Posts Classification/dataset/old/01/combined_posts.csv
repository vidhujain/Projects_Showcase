"**About the calculator:**

Based on /u/Distance_Runner and AskSebby’s valuation calculators, I made a simple webapp for the ol' American Express vs. Chase Trifecta question, as they're currently the most competitive rewards families. The link to the webapp is at the end of the post.

I made this because I felt like there wasn’t a calculator out there that was as clear and provided a visualization of valuation over time. Any card combination with each trifecta is viable and output will dynamically adjust for any valid input. Factors such as benefits valuation, point caps for certain cards, ease of credit use, current transfer partners, and other confounding variables such as American Express not being as widely accepted should be taken into account. Further research into the cards and their benefits should definitely be done, as this post and the website provide a summary. The webapp is not optimized for mobile.

**Chase trifecta cards:**

The cards chosen were the Freedom Unlimited, Freedom, and Sapphire Reserve, with the CSR carrying a $450 AF and $300 almost all-inclusive travel credit. The earning categories are as follows:

* 3x travel worldwide (CSR)
* 3x restaurants worldwide (CSR)
* 5x Freedom categories (CF) (rotating quarterly categories according to the [calendar](https://creditcards.chase.com/a1/freedom/calendar))
* 1.5x miscellaneous purchases (CFU)

**AMEX trifecta cards:**

The AMEX cards in this calculator are the Blue Business Plus, the Gold card, and the Platinum card. The platinum and gold card carry a $550 and $250 AF, respectively, with credits and benefits varying for each. The earning categories are:

* 5x flights (plat) or 3x flights (gold), booked with airlines or through American Express
* 4x restaurants worldwide (gold)
* 4x US supermarkets (gold)
* 2x miscellaneous purchases (blue business plus)

**How the calculator works:**

Category spend is obtained from user input and multiplied by their respective category multipliers for any card combination and converted to points using the truth tables below. The points are then summated and multiplied by the redemption multiplier to obtain the dollar valuation. Annual fees are then subtracted and benefits are added to offset them, at the end of the first year.

**Multiplier truth tables:**

"I applied for the CSR last Thursday and was approved when I thought my chances were average at best. 

When I applied I had a 744 TransUnion vantage score, 722 FICO score, and 28% utilization rate. My income is $63K.

The CLs for the cards are $4.1K and $5K respectively. 

A little over a month ago I opened a savings account with chase and dumped around $1.5K in it. I would’ve put more but there are no Chase branches near me and I did this mostly so I could just see what my offers were. I’m not sure if this had any bearing on my application given that the account hasn’t been open for that long. 

When I applied the page said my application would be reviewed and when I called that day I got the two weeks message.

I'm trying to purchase an item for around $2k, and was wondering if there are CCs that give a hefty cashback on purchases over the first 3~4months.

- Will be getting a secondary card for my partner so we can double our points :D We currently do this with the BC
- Spend at least $2K-5K per month (between bills, educational stuff (courses, books, etc.), house items, etc.)
- CL on the BC is currently $10K
- We travel at least every other month (though, in the last 3 months, we were traveling back to back, for a total of 4 trips). We plan on traveling a lot this coming year (Europe, Japan and Mexico, which we do at least 3 or 4 times a year).

"Hi Everyone,

I just had some questions regarding the travel delay benefit and was wondering if anyone has had experience with it and could help me out.

So originally I had flown from US &gt; Tokyo and was supposed to spend 1 night in Tokyo and then fly to Korea the next day. Unfortunately, that next day was the day Typhoon 19 hit Japan and had my flight cancelled. I'm assuming the $500 would go towards covering my extra nights of hotel in Japan until I can depart to Korea (the earliest I could book was Tuesday). Do I need to somehow show proof that from the airline that Tuesday was indeed the earliest I could have gotten from them? (I'd hope not, because dealing with the airline was such a pain, especially since it's foreign and has no US call number and they only have an English speaker at certain hours).

I believe all my expenses for eating would be covered as well right? (As long as they're under $50?). It says transportation would be covered as well, does that mean they'd reimburse me for taking the subway around Tokyo? Since they mainly use a IC card that you can top up, can I provide receipts of me topping up my card and get reimbursements for all of that?

Lastly, some items I did not have a receipt to, but I took a picture of. Such as a ramen vending machine ticket that had the price, date and name of the restaurant on a little stub, do you think that would be sufficient enough?

I have been leaning towards the Chase Freedom because when paired with the Discover, it would be 3/4 of the year with 5% gas.

I know the effective annual fee of the Platinum (after the credits) will be lower than the Reserve, especially after next year when the Reserve's goes up to match the Platinum. So basically my question is, does the Reserve offer enough of a boost in upgrade priority plus other benefits to outweigh the more substantial benefits (in my opinion) and lower cost of the Platinum?

"Was Just approved for my first credit card after college. My parents were telling me getting a credit card would be beneficial in the long run. I was recently approved for a Bank of America cash reward card with a $3500 limit. Reading online I was expecting a lot less for a first credit card.Around 500ish 

Should I be using my card for every purchase or should I be using it only on large purchases?

Is there a catergory i should keep my 3% in most of the time since you can only change it once a month?( I eat out a lot but I also travel a lot by car) So I don't know if i should keep it in gas or dining.

I also have a 15 month no intrest on it. I am looking for a big purchase for a new laptop for work and such. I have the money now but rather not spend all of it all at once. Can i make a purchase of 1000-2000$ and slowly pay it off or is it better to pay it all at once?

Also is there a difference between Visa vs Mastercard? The person at the bank ask and said I should have one of each. So my debit is a mastercard and Credit card is a visa",First Credit Card. How to maximize the benefits with cash back,1
"So long story short I was approved for my first credit card, which was the Bank of America Cash Rewards. Since I have absolutely no credit history whatsoever, my limit is set at $500 for right now. So here are my questions:

1. Approximately how long after opening my first credit card will I be able to have a credit score? Credit Karma says about 3-6 months.
2. In conjunction with the first question, how long until I can request to extend my credit limit? Being stuck at $500 is very inconvenient.
3. What exactly is credit utilization ratio and can I see it on my credit report?I have a limit of $500. Is my utilization ratio one of the following?:- The highest balance I ever have on my account compared to my limit in one month.- The highest transaction I ever do on my account compared to my limit in one month.- The total amount of money I spent using this credit card in a month compared to the limit regardless of whether I made payments or not.- The balance that's reported to credit bureaus compared to my limit.

I'm most concerned about credit utilization ratio because Bank of America has an offer for new Cash Rewards users, which basically says that if you spend $1000 using this card in the first 3 months after opening the account, you'll get $200. The thing is, I have already spent well over $800 in the first month, but I never let the balance go over my limit. In fact, my balance was actually negative when the first closing date came (I overpaid some stuff). If the credit utilization ratio is the third one, then I'm screwed.

Thank you in advance and I apologize for the wall of text.

I have a 0% BT and pay interest on purchases every month and ok it's a small amount but I want to bring it down to $0.

"I've used Capital One Eno Virtual Numbers for over a year now. It seemed like a great idea. I create an individual, virtual number for each online merchant I use. I never enter my actual card number online. (In fact, since I started using them, I've *only* used this card through virtual numbers. I use other cards for face-to-face transactions.) I assumed that this meant if one number was compromised, that virtual number could be canceled and I wouldn't need to replace my physical card. That is not the case. 

After two hours on the phone, here's what I've found out happens after a virtual number is compromised:

* You call in and identify the fraudulent charges, your card is canceled, and you are sent a new card. 
* The virtual number is not canceled and it remains in your Eno account. 
* All of your virtual numbers are linked to the new card, including the compromised one. 
* No one at Capital One will tell you that it was a virtual number that was compromised. 

Here's what you might expect when speaking to an agent on the phone: 

* If you ask what number was used for an individual transaction, the agent you're speaking to *might* be able to tell you. One agent seemed convinced they could, but never actually gave me a number so that I could confirm this. 
* If you ask for all of the transactions that were made through a virtual number, the agent might tell you ""none"". Then, when you find one, the agent might tell you ""I missed that one"". I don't know if they can actually search for this information either. 
* It is entirely up to you to bring up virtual numbers. Some agents don't seem to know they exist and they don't seem to have procedures built around them. 

I don't quite understand the point of virtual numbers. If one is compromised, your card is still canceled – worse, the compromised number still exists and can be used and it's up to you to figure that out. You cannot tell what number was used for an individual transaction through Capital One's website and I'm not sure their agents on the phone can either. 

I asked several agents what the point of the virtual numbers was. They all told me that, because I wasn't entering my actual credit card number, it was more secure. I asked how that was more secure and the agent would tell me that It was more secure because no merchant would know my actual card number.

That Capitalone card had like 3 fraud alerts during the 4 or so years I've had it. The last two were within like 2 months of each other and after that final one, I got fed up with Capitalone and canceled the card.

I've also had an American Airlines Barclays card that got a bunch of fraud charges in California despite not having used it in months. Granted, i had used it extensively when I was in China (since it was the only card that worked there some of the time.) However, I also had a Uber Barclays Card for 2 years which has never gotten a single fraud alert despite it being my most used card (in the number of places I've used it at due to its 4% cashback for restaurants.)

I've been told that there might be spyware on my computer causing my card numbers to be frequently stolen but the problem seems to persist even after I've reformatted and reinstalled everything.

Besides trimming down the number of cards, is there anything I can do to reduce the possibility of having to replace more credit cards in the future due to repeated fraud alerts, giving my facts, history, and the things I've already tried?",Frequent fraud requiring card replacement among multiple cards from multiple issuing banks.

So essentially it would be nice to have a card with no FTF but it’s not super important.
Idk if it’s best to go a cash back route or dive into the trifectas. I’ve heavily looked into the chase trifecta because I might want to start building it but idk if I’m ready to spend the extensive amounts in the bonus time frame for the fee cards like the CSR or CSP. I was thinking more in the direction of a no fee card.

But what is better, the travel or the cash back? (I guess no one is better than the other)

I could get another discover it with the rotating categories or a flat rate 2% but then yet again idk if my times more worth starting a trifecta like I said.

I’m your typical 21 year old. I spend a crap ton on gas and eating out (I wish it wasn’t this way) and I live at home so I have few bills but I do look towards the future of moving out in a year and knowing I’ll have to have concerns on 
earning points for groceries and other things. Another factor that may or may not be important is that I plan on possibly finishing my bachelors here soon while I work full time on salary.

Hello my fellow credit card nerds,

I'm coming to you guys and gals today looking for opinions on what I consider my ""plan"" for finishing out my credit card portfolio and I want to see what you all think.

Current Cards:

Capital One Student Journey: $500 CL (Opened 2016)

Amex Blue Delta Skymiles Card: $3,800 CL ( Opened April 2019)

Chase Freedom: $4,400 CL (Approved 9/25/19) - Still waiting on my card.

FICO Score: 738

I've never missed a payment and I pay my balances in full. I don't want to have to many cards but there are a couple cards I want in my collection for reasons I'll explain below:

Amex Gold: I could see this card being my daily driver while earning MR points faster then transferring em to SkyMiles

Uber Card: People Call this the ""millennial CC"" and I just think it would be nice to have in my back pocket, wouldn't see myself using it outside the SUB, maybe as the card for Uber rides when I use Uber that's it.

Apple Card: I'm a Apple fiend and just want the card to have it. 100% sure I would be getting it for flex value and because again I'm a Apple Fiend.

Aside from those 3 cards I have no desire to get any other cards. Again I just got approved for the Freedom card so I'm focusing on that SUB then want to see if I still want the Gold Card considering all the changes coming in 2020 (losing Roadside Assistance is big imo) most of my expenses come from eating out, bills, and general shopping, so I still feel like the gold card would work for me just not sure if its worth it after the changes. I guess what I'm asking is does it make sense for me to get the Gold Card after I hit the Freedom SUB or wait till the beginning of 2020 to weigh my options. The AF isn't what scares me what scares me is I get the Gold Card and I'm going to regret it 6 months later because its not what I expected. As for the Apple and Uber card in y'all opinion is it even worth applying for considering I know I probably won't use them rarely if it all.

Can you apply for financing through that same company for that purchase, even though you may have already done that?

" 

I've  read that there is no definite timeline for Amex chargebacks. I filed  one at the 2 year mark and was told that they could do an inquiry. I  guess this is just to get a response from the merchant. The merchant  just replied in writing that they were working on it. I received a  message from Amex stating that the merchant is working to resolve the  issue and to contact them for further assistance. The merchant has been  giving me the run around ever since. It is now 3 years. One  representative at Amex told me that they could only do an inquiry, but  they could not do anything more than that. Has anyone heard of a  chargeback that is years old where the buyer prevailed?

Here is the story behind the transaction:

I  purchased a door that was supposed to be painted/finished by the  distributor. The way the door industry works is that manufacturer makes  all of the parts and ships it to a distributor for final assembly. They  also handle all finishing processes. I received the door and it was not  painted on all six sides. I contacted the manufacturer and was told that  the warranty would be void if not painted properly. I had the store I  purchased the door from contact the distributor and the rep said it  would be fine. I asked for them to put it in writing and was told by the  store associate that the distributor would have to honor the warranty. I  should have pushed the issue. The door started delaminating at the  bottom where it isn't painted.

I  brought this to their attention a few times and keep getting the  runaround. The rep finally said he would give me a door blank, but I  would have to remove all the glass myself. He also refused to paint it. I  paid around $500 to have them paint it. The guy at the lumber yard  where I purchased the door said he could probably do the glass, but he  didn't want to damage anything. He didn't seem to think the resolution  was fair either. Keep in mind, even if they provide me with a new door, I  still have to pay to have the new door installed.

I've  been asking for a full refund, or the doors fully assembled and  painted. I will pay for the install and return the defective doors.

- Able to use while traveling anywhere (internationally and domestically).

- Since this is only used during my travels, low maintenance in not having to always deposit something inside to have the account open

I was an idiot when I was younger &amp; didn't realize how credit worked. I built up ~$6500 in debt on a Capital one card w high interest continuously accumulating. About this time last year I finally got smart &amp; researched how to stop that &amp; pay it down. I opened up 2 new cards around February 2019, the chase slate &amp; the sapphire reserve. With the slate, I used their 0% transfer fee &amp; 0% interest rate for 24 or 36 (can't remember) months to transfer the $6500 to it. I then spent from February until now paying off all of my student loans, my car &amp; that debt. As of this past weekend I am completely debt free.

It's since gone back up to 770, but now I have the dilemma of keeping the slate open or closing it out. I pay for everything on the reserve for the points &amp; make sure to pay it off every month to avoid my previous mistakes. Looking at Experian, I have exceptional ratings for payment history and amount of debt. My credit mix is very good as well. My credit history length is only at good. It says it's at 4 yrs 9 months bc of the 2 new open cards. My amount of new credit is only fair bc in addition to those 2 credit inquiries I had a few for mortgage pre-approval that we ended up not using, and latest open accounts being 6 months. 

If I don't plan on using the slate anymore bc I use the reserve for all of my purchases &amp; the slate provides no more perks since I won't be having the same mistakes, should I still keep it open or should I close it out?

"All,

I currently have an AMEX Blue Cash Preferred that I upgraded to on an offer last September. That offer came with $150 dollar statement credit. It's now a year later and I got billed a partial year's membership fee last month. I called last night about if there were any retention offers I could get to keep me from wanting to downgrade (net of the signup bonus my annual spend on groceries would put in about the same place if I downgraded). I was offered an $100 statement credit if I spend $3,000 in the next 3 months. I told him I needed to run some numbers to see if I felt like that made sense. 

As part of the discussion he mentioned that if I cancel, and possibly even if I downgrade, that I would forfeit the previous $150. I don't plan to cancel, ultimate endgame would be just downgrade back to the Everyday. This led me to my main question: If I take the retention offer, that likely comes with time strings as well right? I'm trying to decide if it makes more sense to just wait out till I can downgrade without penalty and just move on.

* Current card: NCFU nRewards Secured. $3,000 limit. March 2017. 1x points for everything.
* FICO Score: 780
* Oldest account age: 2 years, 6 months. (Just the above credit card).
* Income: Variable income at about $800-1,000 per paycheck.
* Average monthly spend and categories:
   * Subscription Services: $20
   * Eating out $150
   * Gas: $150-$200
* Open to Business Cards: No
* What's the purpose of your next card? *e.g. Building credit, Balance transfer, Travel, Cashback*
   * Most Likely cashback. I've looked at other categories like low APR, 0% intro APR, or building credit, but I'm using/used my current card to build credit, and have paid it off in full every month since I got it. I would keep doing that for the second credit card to avoid interest, so low/%0 intro APR \*I think\* would just be incase I stop paying on time, so mostly looking at cashback.
* Do you have any cards you've been looking at?
   * [NFCU More Rewards American Express](https://www.navyfederal.org/loans-cards/credit-cards/offers/more-rewards.php) I was looking at this card because of the 3x points on gas and restaurants, and because it was with the bank I was already apart of. (Not sure if someone can let me know if it's a pain to pay off a credit card separately from where the majority of your funds are? I've been with NFCU my whole life, so I don't know how it would be to use multiple banks.)
* Are you OK with category spending or do you want a general spending card?
   * General spending preferred, but not opposed to category (Maybe for gas?)

For context, I'm a 21 year old college student and I'm living at home. I've been using YNAB since the start of my year to keep track of my budget/savings/emergency fund, and other than possible cashback, I was thinking of getting a second credit card to help myself financially in the future, because I'm paying for school on my own, and while for now I don't have to talk out a loan (working while at my community college), I know in the future when tuition is higher, that won't be the case.

If anyone knows of card separate what I described above but could also be helpful, please let me know, or if someone thinks I'm doing ok now and don't really need another card. I usually would push off thinking about getting another card, but I saw the NFCU More Rewards Amex and thought I would look into it again.

My wife currently has: Gold Delta Skymiles (amex)

June 2019

$7500 limit

$30k income (household- both students)

750 credit score (Amex)

No other credit cards, but a 2 year car loan history that's almost paid off with no late payments.

Looking for datapoints/thoughts on the following: I know it's a common teaching that Chase doesn't like to issue cards without a year of credit card history (as a general rule). We've been looking for a mastercard for my wife in order to pay off her car via plastiq for a MSR, and we're eyeing the Chase IHG premier for the ATH bonus. Not sure if she stands a chance since she hasn't had her delta card for a year yet, and doesn't have that year of history for a credit card. Any thoughts on approval chances? 

Especially since it's a hotel branded card and not a freedom/sapphire?

Anyone know if you've got better luck here with a hotel card from chase as opposed to a freedom/sapphire which are the typical DPs?

(note, i'm at 4/24 and just barely got another chase card, and have IHG which is why I'm asking for her)

"Title says it all, except for one small caveat.

I just finished disputing one derogatory account on TransUnion and Experian (Equifax never add the collection account to my credit report for some reason) 

The disputes with TU &amp; Experian were both SUCCESSFUL due to Identity Fraud from a crazy ex girlfriend. TransUnion finished the deletion from my report at the end of September; Experian concluded their dispute process earlier today.

From what I can tell, both reports from each bureau don't show the collection/derogatory any longer, but I'm still a little reluctant to apply for my first credit card just yet because I'm not certain if I've given it enough time for whichever credit card company I choose (with y'alls help, hopefully!) to not see the negative on my credit report.  So, I reckon my question is:

TLDR - Is one day after getting a resolution report from Experian regarding a successful dispute that resulted in deletion of a derogatory account long enough to apply for a credit card?

I doubt I get any positive points for this, especially considering how old the account is.  

***My current score on TU &amp; Equifax is showing 651 on Credit Karma. From what I know this is a generic score CK gives me just for the sake of putting a number on it.

Purpose: the main purpose with these two cards will be to both ensure I’m getting the most rewards for my spending on both bonus and more everyday spending, and of course get a hefty sign on bonus. I travel every week, although my work pays for the tickets and all travel related expenses. I’ve been on the fence with the Amex platinum as I’m just not sure I’d ever spend it on the items you need to use it with in order to get the full 5x. I do like the idea of the Uber credit and and definitely the lounge access but just don’t know if those two things justify the hefty annual fee. Especially when I think about getting the gold instead and using the 4x point on supermarkets and restaurants.

"I didn't find much info online about this. My CSR's year begins in May, so it's about halfway through the current year. In 2020 my wife and a couple of our children will be traveling internationally. I want to get her a CSR, primarily so she has Priority Pass when they travel. Later in 2020 our whole family will be traveling internationally, and both of us having Priority Pass will get our family into lounges. To us it is worth the $75 charge, plus she will be able to use the card for travel related purchases when I am not with her, which will somewhat offset the AU fee.

I have read anecdotal reports of CSR users adding an AU partways through the year and not being charged the $75 fee. However, the Terms and Conditions would indicate that it will be charged, even for a partial year. I am looking for some information, anecdotal or otherwise, of when I can sign her up and have a reasonable expectation of not being charged for the remainder of the year. I will need to get my wife added by March 2020 or so at the latest in order to get the credit card and Priority Pass in time for their trip, so it will be only 2 months away from renewal.

For Chase's personal cards, authorized users are clearly just an afterthought.  I really wish they'd improve that because the offering is otherwise pretty compelling.

"I've had the chase quadfecta for years, and just recently decided to get the Citibank trifecta. I noticed on the Citibank app that they have a live chat support option which I thought was really cool since Chase only has secure message which is basically an email service.

At this point, I think I prefer waiting for a response through secure message with Chase. Every time I've reached out in the live chat in the Citi app, the agent either doesn't respond at all or just gives a basic canned response that doesn't answer my question whatsoever.

"This is my success story with recon, after several attempts. 

So last week I applied for the Amazon Prime Rewards VISA Card, I could not help it - I shop a lot on Amazon and the gift card for $70 made me decide to apply.
I applied and did not get an instant approval.

I got the we will let you know in 30 days message.

Btw, they pulled Experian if I can remember correctly.

I immediately find the number online to check my application status, I was told we will let you know the decision in 30 days.

So I waited patiently and the next day I received a call from the fraud department at Chase. The rep asked me for the code sent to my phone then asked me two questions, then following this she put me on hold and I was told I would get a decision in 7-10 days.

So wait, I verified information and still didn’t get a approval or denial. Okay!

I called the app status line and it said 7-10 days I will get my decision in writing. Sounds like a denial to me.

I called recon and they told me that my application was being closed because they could not verify my information. I called fraud and they said the same thing and to wait for 7-10 days. They also said they would request for the hard pulls to be taken off my report. Very scripted. But I waited patiently for the letter.

In this week, I was sent pre-approved emails for the CSP and car loan - not interested! 

The letter indeed stated they could not verify information on the application and that the application was denied because of this.

So I call recon who transferred me straight to the fraud department. I get one rep who tells me this is a final decision and can’t be overturned. I ask to speak to a supervisor and the phone hangs up. I called again and asked to speak with a supervisor, the rep puts the phone on hold twice and tells me no supervisor is available. So what I do, hang up and try again. I called a third time and told the rep I was trying to confirm my identity and if I could speak to a supervisor, well third time was the charm. I was able to have a supervisor recon my app by asking me two questions. She put me on hold and told me I was approved for the card.

There was no extra hard pull for the recon. I believe they just needed to verify my information.

"I’ve spent a lot of time trying to research and figure this out myself, but I’m hoping you all with your incredible knowledge can help me figure out a couple things. 

I rarely travel, but I have a few vacations over the next 2 years that I’d like to accumulate points/miles for. My past CC acquisitions have been pretty random, and my main goal was to maximize cash back. I’m fairly new here and never strategized in the past. 

My main question is which reward system should I use (UR, MR, TY)? All flights will likely be domestic (USA) and possibly one to Mexico. We also travel to Alaska, where my spouse is from, and only Delta and Alaska Airlines fly there from my location. Not listed in the template is any Amex SkyMiles cards. My spouse and I both got Delta Gold SkyMiles cards for SUBs and then canceled because of AF. It’s been just over 2 years since canceling both. Can I get them again or other AMEX SkyMiles cards and get the SUB? From what I’ve read the answer is no and the T&amp;C for AMEX seems vague (says it’s at their discretion). 

Right now the only Chase card I use is CF. Sapphire &amp; Slate were obtained for 0% offers and I assume I could PC them. I use my BCE and AMEX business. I use Citi DC for all other general spending and usually put $1,000-1,500/month on it. I’m in all 3 point systems, would it be better to try and focus on one? Get CFU and sacrifice .5% from DC to build points with Chase, along with getting other Chase cards (business &amp; personal)? Or continue with DC and get Premier/Prestige when I want to book trips (with new availability to transfer DC to TY points)? Or try to focus on AMEX for Delta (Spouse &amp; 4 kids, so lots of miles needed to get to Alaska)? 

It seems like UR are most flexible and there are a bunch of cards I could get (and PC a couple without affecting 5/24?), but it seems the more I read and try to compare, the more confused I get. I don’t have any AF cards and I’m not opposed, but figured I’d wait to get any until I’m ready to transfer points and book (first half of 2020). 

TL;DR: 1. Which reward system should I use to build up travel rewards and should I funnel most spending there? Spouse + 4 kids= can never have enough points.

2. Can I get AMEX SUBs again after getting and canceling SkyMiles cards?

3. Bonus question: Is it worth sacrificing higher cashback (like 3% grocery or dining) to funnel spending to one system (like use CFU) to later be used for travel?

I would really appreciate any advice so I can start making a plan. Thank you!

"October 2019 is the two-year anniversary of my first credit card (US Bank Platinum) and the one-year anniversary of my second card (US Bank Cash+), and with a vacation planned for the second half of the month, I feel it's appropriate to finally get that third credit card. (My credit score is over 700 and I make a modest income, so I'm not really worried about approval odds)

I no longer use the platinum (just an automated Hulu payment on it to keep the account active), and I'd like to find a card that pairs nicely with the 5%/2%/1% cashback rewards I earn with my Cash+. Ideally, this card would have a 0% APR intro period.

My biggest monthly spends outside of rent and bills are on dining and groceries. I have subscriptions to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, AMC Theatres, and will be adding Disney+ in November. I don't have a car, so cashback incentives for gas would not apply to me. I also don't travel that often, maybe once or twice a year at most.

"Hi, I'm a college student with about $35,000 income (internships, financial aid and scholarships) and about 730-740 credit score. My oldest account is about 1 year and avg is about 7 months. I'm trying to get a card that I can pay our college apartments rent of $3k, every month so that I can stack the rewards. There's a flat fee of $20 for using the credit card.

My husband and I are looking to round out our chase trifecta, we are in our mid 20s and thus have fairly limited credit histories. Our first credit cards for each of us were about 6 years ago (Barclay’s UPromise and Cap1 quicksilver). As we are opening up new cards that are more relevant to our lifestyles now we are noticing the AAoA on our credit scores plummeting.  I was thinking it may be beneficial to add each other as AUs to our oldest accounts to sure up that foundation of good credit. I have also heard that AMEX reports AUs to credit bureaus from the date they are added not the date the account was opened. Is that also true of Barclay’s and Cap1?

Our credit scores are in the mid-upper 700s today but with us each adding 1-2 cards in the last 6 months or so, our credit age has been shortened and is the biggest impact on our scores today.",Which banks report the history of the account for Authorized Users?,1

I've had my **Amex Delta Skymiles Platinum** card for over a decade making it my oldest card. Its usefulness has been completely displaced by other cards (***Chase Sapphire Reserve****,* ***Capital One Venture****, etc.*). I'm coming up on my yearly renewal and leaning heavily toward cancelling it - however was curious if anyone else has had recent experience with Amex's retention dept? What (*if anything*) did they offer you to stay? Once **YEARS** ago I remember they offered me something like 40K miles (i.e. $400) not to cancel which absolutely made it worth it to me - but my spend on it was still pretty high back then. I've only got a $23K spend on it for 2019 (*less than 1/2 of what it was back then*) and they're likely to notice that my spend dropped to less than $1K/mo back in May (*when I got the other cards*).

"Hello I've thought about posting a few times, even started once but couldn't keep things short, so I'll try again now.

I owned two homes (1 rental), had a few credit cards with a total credit limit of maybe 30k and credit score topped out at about 760 (for several years) when I made a series of unfortunate decisions (like opening a small restaurant, among many other things) and everything blew apart in a nuclear fashion.

Well, finally things are looking up, I found a decent job in a new area and now for the first time in prob 3-4 years of financial stress and trauma I had the heart to look at my accounts, my credit score, make lists of all current bills and budget everythjng out.

I'm going back and forth a lot with credit karma. Trying to prove who I am to get back in, but I went through some chase thing and they say I'm 636 now wwith 6 negative items hitting me. 

Before all this happened, I had these cards.

2 Cap one cash back cards, one $3750CL one $750CL

1 amegy bank card $3750 cl

1 alliant credit union card $15000 cl

1 chase freedom revolving 5% card. 7000 cl

So they all got maxed. Cap one I had never been late before, ever, and always made mad rewards, well they restricted both accounts but basically said online that when caught up everything will be fine. I remember the phrase, as you pay the account down your available credit will increase. Well I paid one off and dropped 1k on the other and they closed the account and continue to say restricted acct on the one I paid down by 1k.

Alliant canceled the card and has come calling once or twice in the past ffew years. What's odd is at one point I sent them a message thru their site, like an automated box, that I was prepared to make small monthly payments (50) until I pay some stuff off and then can afford something more. Never heard from them. I'm wondering about statue of limitations on that one. Maybe I wont have to pay them and nust wait the 7 years until it falls off, I'm half way there already. But I expect a lawsuit last minute, alliant also carried the car note and they took it to an auction and only got 8k for a car I could have got 15k for fairly easy, still owed 20k so my total debt to them is around 30k.

The last the time they called I returned the guys voicemail, got his voicemail, and told him, yes sir this is ______  and I understand this is about a debt but you must understand my roof and inside of my house have been destroyed by hurricane Harvey and even if I had the money to pay you right now, which I dont, I'll be focused on getting a roof and rebuilding my house. My number is ____ if u want to talk further. Havent heard from them in over a year since then

I have upped all my autopays to be a few hundred above min payment, on all cards, and I made a spreadsheet and determined a payoff order.

Do I need to do anything besides call and get the payoff amount and pay that amount? I dont need a ""pay for delete"" do I?  Anything else about getting free from the old cards?

And what about moving forward? I would love a 6% groceries AMEX card, or some really strong use-for everything cash back card. 

I still have the amegy card and the chase freedom card. 

My house is on the market and it's my oldest account. So while my cc utilization is coming down by over 1k a month, I also lost some long accounts (cap one cc was years old, oldest account is my house and will hopefully sell soon. Alliant closed their card, etc)

So I've only had a basic credit card from the local credit union since I was maybe 18 or so, never really thought about a rewards/cash back card. I've heard of them but I didn't think much about it since I didn't travel or go on vacations for most of my life. Fast forward about 10 years and now I'm with someone who loves to travel and I still have the same basic card. I would like to get a rewards/cash back card that is more focused on traveling as we plan on doing 1 or 2 big vacations a year ( and by big, I mean 5-10 days, airfare, hotel) and maybe 1 or 2 small weekend trips that might just be in driving distance. 

I do plan on buying a house with in the next year and a half,  sooner if I find a deal worth going for. I read that you don't want to open a new card/account if you plan on buying soon, but I can't figure out what the estimated cut-off period would be prior to buying. I figure I'll be spending a good amount on home improvement and every thing else that comes with first time home buying. I also have a weekend car that I am slowly working on so a few $2-4k purchases will be done a year for that. Otherwise most spending , aside from bills/necessities, is done at breweries/restaurants. 

I can't tell what card(s) I would really benefit most from, as my spending categories seem to be spread around, and if it's worth it to get one card from one bank, lets just say capital one,  and one from wells fargo, as I can't seem to understand how one builds up enough points/cash to be worth it to actually use if you are only using for maybe half of your purchases/spending.

Would just going for a travel card make the most sense or would a card that has a higher % back but lesser cash/trade-in value be better given where I spend?

Usually whenever I login for something or see the balance is high I make a $2000 payment but typically I'm charged a bit of interest every month for random amounts ($1000-$3000).   

I think its because the payments are paying off the recent transactions and not the old ones so they are being charged still because it benefits the credit card company.  

Should I make sure to pay the balance off at least once throughout the month and if so does it matter when i paid it?

Credit Score: 760 (Equifax,TransUnion)

Income: $10,000 (full-time student, part-time employed)

I am looking for a new credit card because I am applying to medical school and I will be paying for a lot applications fees, so I might as well take advantages of SUBs while I can. I only work part-time so my annual income is pretty limited. This also means that I can't really afford any credit cards with annual fees because most of the time I do not spend enough money to cover them, and I don't travel much either so that rules out a lot of cards as well.

I was considering the AMEX blue cash everyday card or the Uber Visa card. I was leaning more toward the AMEX just because they have a better SUB that I could definitely get ($175, $1,000 spending in first three months). It would probably be good to start building a relationship with AMEX as well in case I want to apply for their charge cards in the future. However, I think the Uber Visa has better benefits that I would benefit from more on a daily basis. Not really sure if I'm competitive for the Uber card, though.

A year ago I applied for my first credit card on which I was not an authorized user, and have been paying it on time since.  As it is a secured card (couldn't get anything else, as credit history was nonexistent aside from being an authorized user), the benefits are pretty poor, 1% on gas and groceries and that is all.  As it has been approximately a year now, would this be a good time to start looking at new cards?  I'm aware it would probably be best for my credit score to keep my current card open for length of history, but if I can get one with better rewards I would happily keep two open unless there was some reason not to do so.

"Hi everyone,

First time posting here so not sure if I need to include anything but I have a few questions. I have had the Chase Freedom for a couple of months now and saw that I was prequalified for the CSP card so I decided to see if I would be approved for it and applied as it was a card I've been trying to work my way into. I was rejected for supplying to low of an income.

For context I am still a college student but have had a few internships for my salary as well as investments &amp; scholarship. The initial amount I put was $16k as this was the money I have earned up to this point this year from my internship + other income. I called the reconsideration line because I forgot to include my scholarship, a little bit of allowance, and my other job that doesn't pay hourly but rather a stipend. I also thought that they would allow ""expected income"" and I have an internship lined up already that would be paying me 28/hr or another $11k for the summer (pre-tax). When I called not only was I told that my expected income wouldn't count (this I was kind of iffy on anyway) but that the money I earned over the summer at my internship did NOT count as income either since I no longer had the job. This actually LOWERED my overall income by almost half. I'm honestly confused as to what I am supposed to record for my income. Has this happened to anyone else? Is this really their policy and is there no way around this? Thanks for taking the time to read this I'm just a little upset that my income actually reduced instead of increased like I expected it to.

Edit: I got the letter for why I was rejected and the only reason was that my gross annual income was too low. 

TL;DR: Had an internship over the summer that accounted for a majority of my income but the fact that it is over it does NOT count towards my gross income for my application + expected income does not include future jobs that you have not started yet (although I have already signed with them and just awaiting my start date).",CSP Reconsideration Income does not count if you no longer work there?,1

"I have a CSP and just started using the amazon prime rewards card points. I liked the 5% back on amazon so it was an easy decision for me, but i was surprised to find that these rewards were shown as points, not traditional cash back. Evidently, I didnt do my homework before I applied. But the 5% back on amazon and 2% at gas stations is a great value that I’m not getting from the CSP but since they’re both in the chase rewards portal, will these points pool together?

"I have a credit card that I’ve had for a couple of years. When the last card expired, they sent a new card and stated they had “opened a new account” with a higher limit. I have never had a company create a new ACCOUNT when the old CARD expired, they’ve always just sent a new card for the existing account—but sure enough, my Credit Karma page alerted me to the new account as well. Essentially it’s as if my old account was closed and a new credit card account was opened...

1) can/should I dispute the account since this will affect my length of credit history, average age of accounts, etc? 

2) should I close the account (I don’t use this card much) or will that just hurt me more?

Bit of background: I currently have the CSR, US Bank AR, and Bonvoy cards as my $450 premium cards. Unfortunately I don't have the FU or F, and I'm 9 months away from being under 5/24. I'm thinking of changing the CSR into a Freedom and carry the Propel instead, with the AR and Bonvoy used for flights/hotels. I only fly once, maybe twice a year and don't spend more than 12 nights a year at a hotel.

I’m looking to pay off my remaining credit card balance while also paying off as little interest as possible, would appreciate some help!

The details are as follow-

5800 current balance on credit card, 387$ of that is from a balance transfer which the promo date ends 10/24/2019 I’d be paying about 97$ once that date hits in interest for the balance transfer amount.

I was wondering if I should transfer the entire balance to a new credit card(that I’d be opening) without getting a fee from my prior card in interest, also if I’m not able to completely pay off this new card after say 15 months can I do another transfer by then?

My current credit history is pretty great, 12 years of great history, no missed payments, about 5 credit cards opened with a limit of around 60k, I make about 70k. Just worried the new cards limit won’t be as high as I need since I currently have a high limit.

"Hi guys,

I'm a platinum card holder with Amex and have always had a great experience with them. My mother got targeted back in January for a 75k welcome bonus if she signed up for the Delta Gold. I recommend she sign up, get the points, and either keep or downgrade the card a year later. She has never worked with Amex before.

Anyways, she meets the minimum spend for the full 75k and she is credited...30k points. I call up Amex on her behalf and the first representative was extremely rude and said to me my mother was a lier. I yell at him and hang up in a rage then try calling Delta, Delta refers me back to Amex so I call them again this time getting a nicer representative.

They open an internal investigation, saying they'll contact us to get the additional documents (the multiple emails and letters she had offering 75k miles).

Two weeks go by, I check with them, nothing. 4 weeks. 6 weeks. 8 weeks. Finally after the maximum time for the investigation I reach out to them and they tell me the case is closed because they never received any documentation. But they never even asked for it

So they reopen the case and this time I ensure they take the documents right away. Same thing as last time 2 weeks. 4 weeks. 6 weeks. 8 weeks.

Finally after the maximum time, they say the case was resolved. Ended up the investigation team thought the issue was she never received any welcome bonus. Well she did, she got 30k miles, but that wasn't the issue, the issue was it was supposed to get 75k

So they apologized about the misunderstanding and now they opened a second investigation regarding their mistake on the first investigation and yet again another 6-8 weeks.

What the hell do I do? They never contact my mom when the investigation closes and make her wait out the full 8 weeks and they're total idiots.

* **Payment Due Date** \- This is a set date where you have to pay at least the minimum payment (Depending on your balance, 2%-5% of your total balance, a fixed amount of around $25, or your full balance), a desired amount higher than the minimum, or the full statement balance. Paying the full statement balance on the payment due date helps you avoid any interest.
* **Statement Closing Date** \- This is usually a set date but if not, close to the same date every month. This is when your card issuer generates your next statement balance and sends info (Including your remaining balance on the Closing Date) to the credit bureaus. You typically should have at least a  21 day Grace Period from the Closing Date to the Due Date where you are not charged interests as long as you pay your statement balance in full.
* **Autopay** \- An option to automatically pay either the minimum balance, a set amount above the minimum, or the full statement balance before the due date (usually a date you choose). As long as you check that your billing info is correct there shouldn't be too much to worry about, but make sure to always routinely check to see if everything is correct.
* **Charge Card vs Credit Card** \- There are two main differences between a charge card (e.g. AMEX Gold) and a credit card (e.g. Chase Freedom). A Charge card does not give a set spending limit, but still gives a limit on how much you can actively spend (The amount you can actively spend is based on your payment history, credit, income, debts, and other risk factors). Also, a Charge Card requires you to pay off the statement balance in full each month.

Anyone have this problem with amazon? I ordered a Asus RTX 2080Ti from amazon warehouse (it’s a used product, yes I know it was used) through prime 2 day shipping. 

2 days later, I pick it up at a hub locker and I noticed the box was slit open. I immediately was concerned. Right when I got in the car I opened to make sure it was still in there. 

Now right away you can tell this product was used and wasn’t boxed up correctly to be resold as used or an open box. I open the box and notice this is not a 2080ti. They actually shipped me an ASUS GTX 1650 as opposed to the 2080ti I paid $1,166 for. 

I called amazon customer service right away, they tell me okay no worries just ship the item back for a refund. I ship the item back as fast as possible (it was Sunday so I waited till Monday for UPS to open.)

After 3 days of amazon receiving the item they decide to email me and say this is the wrong product. Well obviously, this is why I returned the product.

Apparently amazon goes off package weight when accepting returns. They claim that the package was 4 lbs when shipped to me ( I don’t see package weight anywhere as an amazon truck delivered it, not ups). And according to UPS website that the package was 3.2 lbs. 

So for this .8 lbs of packaging difference, amazon is REFUSING to refund me. I’ve called 4 times and asked for the highest manager or supervisor, no luck. I even called corporate to help and they said they couldn’t help with and I should call customer service.

I got the Freedom Unlimited a few weeks ago and got the 20,000 pts SUB. I was looking into the best way to redeem these points. It came to my attention that I need to have the CSR, CSP, or CiP to transfer to partners. The AF on the CSP isn’t too bad. The extra value from transferring my 20,000pts to partners alone will offset the annual fee for at least two years. The thing is that I don’t really have quite the level of spend to meet the $4000 MSR for the SUB. So it sort of feels like a waste to miss getting the SUB even though I do get a lot of value there. 

I'm looking into booking a trip sometime around December. I'd like to be able to use all my UR points for hotel and flights to pay for most of this trip. But if I redeem for cash back then I'll only be able to pay for like 40% of the trip.",Should I get the CSP just for transfer partners?,1
"What are the best Credit Card sign up bonuses for October  2019 and onwards? my situation explained in details:

 \-I am still at 2/24 (PERSONALS': CSR, Freedom Unlimited. BUSINESS': chase ink prefered, chase united explorer),

\- The catch is that I live abroad so the ""No foreign transaction fees"" is an important fineprint, also maybe  jumping to Amex is not a good move cuz abroad is challenging to get Amex accepted.

\- I am tempted to apply for the 2 other CHASE INKS since I heard soon might count towards 5/24 (the problem here is that those 2 have foreign transaction fees :S).

\- I am also considering other bank cards (example: Barclays , Capital One, US Bank, or Bank Of America &lt;-- which I bank for many years) specially if that will be with cards that dont count towards 5/24.

\- That the bank send the cards abroad will be a plus (I am in Europe traveling), but  no mandatory as I could ask a friend to forward it, I call many  of the banks above  in the past and only like 70% did shipped abroad, for example Chase does, BofA too, some others where pretty gray when it was one that said absolutely not! &lt;-- I think was US Bank which said NOPE.

FICO Score: 738

I've never missed a payment and I pay my balances in full. I don't want to have to many cards but there are a couple cards I want in my collection for reasons I'll explain below: 

Amex Gold: I could see this card being my daily driver while earning MR points faster then transferring em to SkyMiles 

Uber Card: People Call this the ""millennial CC"" and I just think it would be nice to have in my back pocket, wouldn't see myself using it outside the SUB, maybe as the card for Uber rides when I use Uber that's it. 

Apple Card: I'm a Apple fiend and just want the card to have it. 100% sure I would be getting it for flex value and because again I'm a Apple Fiend. 

Aside from those 3 cards I have no desire to get any other cards. Again I just got approved for the Freedom card so I'm focusing on that SUB then want to see if I still want the Gold Card considering all the changes coming in 2020 (losing Roadside Assistance is big imo) most of my expenses come from eating out, bills, and general shopping, so I still feel like the gold card would work for me just not sure if its worth it after the changes. I guess what I'm asking is does it make sense for me to get the Gold Card after I hit the Freedom SUB or wait till the beginning of 2020 to weigh my options. The AF isn't what scares me what scares me is I get the Gold Card and I'm going to regret it 6 months later because its not what I expected. As for the Apple and Uber card in y'all opinion is it even worth applying for considering I know I probably won't use them rarely if it all.

"So quick backstory, I applied for a Gold card back in 2017, got denied. I built some credit history and applied again 3 months ago for the cashback, got auto-approved with a $6k limit. I then applied for the Gold card again 3 days later and had to wait for a sales rep to contact me a few days later to ask for some documents and information. I got approved a few days later.

At first I was confused with the whole 'no pre-set limit' on the Gold card, so I called them and they told me it was supposedly set at $5k per cycle as a 'new' customer, and that it would change/increase eventually depending on my history and status. However after reaching $1.9k in spending on the Gold card I got notified saying it was temporarily blocked until I pay it off and they also called me.. (I also had about 2.5k outstanding on the cashback card at the same time, limit was 6k on that). So about 4k-ish in total on both cards. I found that strange because at this point the customer service rep said that the Gold card limit was just $1300 (unlike 5k what the other rep told me, but I found out this is pretty common with their representatives giving information that isn't consistent or accurate...). Anyway they told me my Gold card will be back to normal once they receive the payment (even though it was the beginning of the cycle, and I paid it from my end and had to wait a few days for them to unblock it), and they said to just pay off my balance right away whenever it reaches 1.3k-ish for the first few periods so that I would overcome that issue.

Anyway, my **First** cycle was 2.5k on cashback card, 1.9k on Gold. **Second** cycle I spend everything on cashback card to make use of my welcome offer, and to avoid that previous problem and the embarrassment of potentially having my Gold card decline while shopping, so I put $4k on it (it was a 6k hard-set limit) and just $250 on the Gold.

**Third cycle** which currently just finished, I thought I'd start using my Gold card again to make use of the welcome offer and points, since I already completed it on the cashback card. I was so nervous for the first few purchases because I would have my phone out every time checking the 'spending power' tool when I'm about to pay for something hoping it won't get blocked again (not exactly the best feeling especially when you're out with other people or in critical situations), so I kept doing that and luckily it kept working every time, my statement came out for $20k by the end of the month and I spent almost nothing on the cashback ($50). Paid both in full and currently going for the 4th cycle.

**So here's my concern.** Like I said I'm not really a big fan of this 'ambiguous' limits thing, however I definitely liked the Amex service and found it nice that they deal with charge cards in a different way. Better than a 'hard' limit, but the thing is that it's unpredictable and no real way to find out? I heard some people say it's 3x your highest bill in the last 3 months? But then again from personal experience that wasn't the case (higher). **And now I'm concerned** that it would change or put me in future potential issues down the road.. I don't spend $20k all the time but some months I do spend more especially if I'm traveling or stuff like that. and I would hate to see that it goes down for example now if I go back to spending less amounts for the next 3 months since it's a quieter time of year, and then suddenly want to spend $20-30k in December-January it wouldn't go through because I had been spending less from October-November ?

I basically need the same $20-30k monthly limit for about 3 or 4 months of the year. Does anyone know if it would change if I spend less eventually or have an irregular pattern in bills, or would it just be fine if I already did that before ? (PS. I always pay all the statements on time and in full. Been a customer for 3 full months now and my credit history was Good until it dropped to Fair for applying for these new cards. Slowly going back up.)

and one final important piece of information: My income that I listed to them doesn't justify this type of spending in any way or form.. but I have some other personal cashflows to sustain it but it's not really possible to quantify or list it on my account.. But does it even matter as long as they're getting payments on time and whatnot ?

Also I know they say you can check the 'spending power' tool to see, but it's not really realistic or possible to do that every single time, like I just wanna know what I can spend on a given month in total from the start, do I just type in ""$20-30k"" on the first day of the cycle ? Plus I heard some people say it's better not to abuse that tool as you can get blocked again? Idk I probably used it about 15 times this past cycle..It's also not exactly the best thing to use my card as a debit card and pay it off after every purchase.. so this past cycle was ideal in that I spent everything and paid it off at the end as soon as my statement was released. I hope that it would stay at least the same way? Not looking for 3x more lol maybe just 1-1.5x

The instance I will use a credit card is for trips. like paying for hotels , travel gas, food. It is a secured card through my bank. I know realized that if I am going to be spending on an annual vacation trip, or occasional road trip, I may as well take advantage of the rewards and transition to an unsecured. I figured it can even save me travel expenses. I tend to pay my credit card after I make my purchases.  I recently got my score from Experian.  760, which is nice for someone who doesn't use the credit card regularly.

When I asked my credit union about the unsecured credit cards, they said it's  1 to 1 point to a dollar ratio. i know other credit cards are higher. I know credit cards can have this high APR percentage. The credit union's Apr is 14%.  Apr shouldn't matter if you pay on time, right?  There is a 1% foreign transaction fee, with no annual fee.

After some researching on credit cards, I think the Bank of America travel cards  is appealing. It offers 1.5 pt to a dollar ratio. 0 foreign transaction fee, with no annual fee.

"I currently have 5 Credit Cards, i recently paid off 2 of them that carried about $250 balances each. One was a local bank CC with only $300 for a limit, the other one is an Amazon/Chase card that i was approved for with a $2500 limit back at the beginning of August. I've incurred no interest on that one due to paying it off the before the statements have closed.

What remains are 3 cards.

Card 1: balance approx $6400; APR 25.24%

Card 2: balance approx $1200; APR 24.90%

Card 3: balance approx $3500; APR 17.24%

I'm budgeting $250/week to paying these off. I fortunately get paid on a weekly basis and can still pay regular bills and food/gas for myself, while saving myself another couple hundred a week towards household stuff.

So I’ve pretty much been able to eliminate my CC spending completely, save for the immediate amazon purchases, which i get the %5 back on with the Chase Card and those get paid out of my ""household stuff"" budget the next week. Also, i have one recurring subscription for a parts modeling kit that occurs monthly.. that one gets charged to CC#2 for approximately $80.

What two out of those 3 cards, would you focus on if you were me?

Personally, I’m thinking that since this is a 5 week paycheck month (every Wednesday) that i should focus on CC#2, because i can see myself paying that one off by the end of this month, as i have another spare $400 or so saved up to attack it with come tomorrow. Then, my monthly subscription will be paid before it has a chance to gain any interests, or should i just straight move my subscription to my Amazon card immediately to gain any sort of points?

I then plan on attacking CC#1, as it has the highest balance, AND APR..meanwhile just putting minimal payments on CC#3.

I figured CC#3 is the card to leave for the end, as it has the lowest APR out of them.

So I've had a Discover card for a few years now to build up some credit while in college. According to the Discover app, my score is 711.

I checked my cards and only one was a Contactless one, - my debit card which my bank just issued me.

I complained to them that I was very concerned that it was a security risk as it could be skimmed. This is their reply to me.

&gt;Contactless cards are as secure as the EMV chip card. For every contactless transaction, a transaction-specific code is created that secures the cardholder's payment information.

PROBLEM 2: in the mix of the move our energy &amp; gas  bills got mixed up and I ended up over paying one and not paying the other (for 3 months). Caught up on that. 

PROBLEM 3: I had set up automatic-payments for a Wells-Fargo student loan totaling about 3,000. They always wound up being late so I payed off the $3000 using a creditcard through my credit union.
That money is still sitting on my CC which is totaling $4,700 and my max for that card is $5000. 

PROBLEM 4: I wound up paying my other student loans late as well - which resulted in me spending $1,500 in one month on student loans. Now my student loans are on a deferment period until December. 

PROBLEM 5: I have outstanding medical bills of $1,500.

My other cards are:

* Chase Freedom (Sep 2018)

My expenses are mostly groceries and dining. From tomorrow Discover it has the Walmart as a 5% which I make most of my grocery purchases there. I am hesitant to get Amex Blue Cash Everyday because of its 3% on US supermarkets which doesn't include wholesale clubs that I make the rest of my groceries from them, that is another reason that I want to get a flat rate card. So, it's not logical to get Amex Blue Cash Everyday now because of Discover it, maybe next year?

I know another thing to take a look is a SUB. None of these cards have any SUBs for now except maybe Amex or Chase cards. That's also another thing that makes me to not get any of them yet maybe?

* Citizens Bank Cash Back Plus World Mastercard which is a flat 1.8% cashback, I know nothing about the mastercard tires but I think it might be a better choice compared to paypal ...

"I'm trying to understand how the structure of Amex's new return protection policy guidelines become effective on Jan 2020.

So the Gold card with AF of 250 will lose return protection but keep purchase protection for up to 10K per incident for the first 90 days which was originally for 120 days. Now the Amex Blue Cash Preferred with an AF of 95 will keep purchase protection but only cover the first 1K in the purchase protection policy per incident also for 90 days. It gets to keep return protection benefits up to 90 days but this drops purchase protection down to 300 dollars for returning the item in question assuming the retailer takes back items or not depending on their return policy beyond the 14 day return window. 

My question is how would it be beneficial to even take advantage of the return protection for an item that's over 1K since Amex would only reimburse you just 300 dollars to return the item if you choose to do so? I can fully understand the purchase protection policy given the possibility something could go wrong with a new purchase but given the extended warranty coverage of an extra year is a better thing to have since that would cover the entire cost if you're using the Gold card (I'm unclear if this is true for the Amex Blue Cash Preferred - meaning whether it would cover the entire cost of the item independent of the limit of 1K of purchase protection.)

"Hi All,

First time poster, but will keep this short and simple.

Recently married, in process of moving all assets over to Bank of America in order to qualify for their Preferred Rewards program. We will qualify for Platinum Honors status. Main reason for doing this (for me) was to take advantage of the free trades through Merrill as well as giving my wife a bump on her current B of A Cash Rewards card earn rate.

My plan was to add the Premium Rewards card as soon as we are enrolled in Preferred Rewards, effectively yielding:

5.25% - Would probably leave set to dining as this makes up a good portion of monthly spend, potentially gas.

3.5% - Grocery &amp; Wholesale

3.5% - Travel/Dining

"Hello everyone, 

I recently applied for the CSR and was rejected for ""Not enough accounts opened long enough to establish a credit history"". After speaking with recon, it was discovered that my Discover card that I've had since 2015 was not showing up on my Experian report. Understandable why I wasn't approved becase my only other credit card is a CFU that I've had for about 6 months. The Discover card shows up on Chase's credit journey program as well as Discover's credit score app but I'm not sure what credit reports those apps pull from.

"Hello

I had a question on credit cards and apps for sending cash.

I currently have a credit card that requires quite a bit of spending to hit certain thresholds for points and rewards.

Can I use CashApp or Venmo to send myself money, then turn around and pay the card off with that same cash?

I do understand there is a limit that you can send per week &amp; per month and there is a fee with each transaction; but, after looking at my rewards, the good outweighs the $3 fee.

Does anyone know if this is possible to do, or do these apps read differently on statements not as spending but as a cash advance?

- CSR
- CFU
- Amazon 
- Discover It
- Amex Platinum
- she might have other ones that I am not aware of

I currently have
- Discover it Secured (one of the few cards I could get without credit history)
- CSP (got it very recently)

I would like to optimize our credit card portfolio as a couple since we do everything (spending, pooling points) together anyways. I wouldn't keep a credit card if it makes no sense to. But I am wondering if it actually makes sense to consider a joint strategy as opposed to each for him/herself.

My line of thinking:
I have the CSP that I only got because of the SUB. When traveling it makes more sense to use my girlfriend's CSR or Amex Plat. Therefore, I am considering downgrading the Preferred to a Freedom once I had it for 12 months and becoming an AU on my girlfriend's CSR. In the meantime I'd get the FU in addition to the one she already because the SUB are decent for the requirements to be met.

My problem is, one of those shotgun applications was the Old Navy card. It hasn't come in the mail yet so I don't remember which version, but what I remember distinctly is that my limit is $2k. Got it in the heat of the moment as I was making an over $400 purchase during a sale. I honestly don't want the card but its $2k limit looks good on my report, right?

"As the title suggests, I am interested in developing a relationship with AMEX and my SO and I are very interested in this card.

My expected salary once I procure a position should be anywhere from $45-55k entry-level. Right now, I am making a bit over $2k a month take-home pay (\~$24k/yr). My SO makes \~$45k/yr (his current credit score via WalletHub is \~695). His utilization is pretty high, however my utilization is 0%.

I have 4 hard inquiries (one falls off in December), and aside from student loans all I have is my auto loan with about $12k left on it. I plan to pay this down rather quickly now that I am not in school and pinching pennies as tightly. I have a strong urge to simply apply for the card, however I don't want to risk a hard inquiry for a denial. I have gone on AMEX's website to check for pre-qualification and I receive offers for the AMEX EveryDay card and the Cash Magnet card. However, given the bulk of our spending, we feel that the Blue Cash Preferred card (even with the annual fee), is the better option for us. What is the likelihood of me being approved if I apply alone? Would it be prudent to apply jointly given my SO's greater income? Should I wait until a better time, and if so, when might that be? (Also, if I call to discuss my concerns with AMEX, can they really provide advice without me actually applying?)

"So I got the Uber Visa 2 months ago and as with every card I turned on automatic payments. Cut to today I'm at a restaurant and it gets declined. I check the app and I see that I have a payment past due. This is what it reads: ""Your minimum payment due on Oct 18th is $27.00. This includes $27.00, which is your past due amount from September 18th"".

I called Barclay's support and they said that the payment for the first statement was returned because the account number wasn't found, and the payment for the 2nd one was canceled because after they couldn't find the account number they removed it from their records.

I *never* received any notification of this via email, push or phone call. I do have emails from them saying my payments were scheduled (auto pay) but nothing about them being returned/canceled.

I asked support if this would show up on my credit report and she said yes, but that once I paid it off it would be removed. This didn't make sense to me as it has been 30 days after the due date September 18th. I wasn't having it so I asked for management and they said they'd give me a call tomorrow. What should I expect? 

My biggest gripe is that if the account number was wrong, it should have checked that the day I put it in like pretty much every other service. I haven't closed any accounts or changed them, and I use the same account on 4 different cards, none of which have ever had a problem.

I haven't paid it off yet, as I want to see what the manager has to say. Also, checking credit karma I don't see any missed payments on there so far, but if they do add one, would it be a good idea to dispute it with the credit bureau?",Past Due payment on Barclay's Card,1

What's the purpose of your next card? I have a $5,880 roof replacement bill to pay in next 30 days.  Insurance paid me directly and roofing company takes credit cards.  Was hoping to use this bill to hit sign-up bonus for cards (would this work?).  Going to pay off balance immediately with insurance money.  Possibly split the bill across a few cards if possible.  Also, looking for better cashback % than costco card provides.  And the price-rewind feature is leaving the costco card, so if another card still offers this feature, that'd be cool. 

Do you have any cards you've been looking at?  Too many.  	Have decision-paralysis.  Chase Freedom, Citi Double Cash back, Discover It, etc.

Are you OK with category spending or do you want a general spending card? I don't want to go super crazy with category spending, but if I have 2-3 cards total that I use one for gas, one for groceries, etc.  I'm good with that.  

  
Just getting into the world of credit cards.  Never liked owing money, but now that I've had my costco card for almost 2 years, I see the benefit of using it like a debit card and getting the perks/cashback.  Saw the roofing bill as an opportunity to hit the sign-up bonus costs easily, if the purchase/payment applies.  Read through several threads, it is just a lot to take in at once.

"Hey all,

I arrived in the US like 6 or 7 months ago and I have no credit history and need to get a credit card to start building one. The options I've read are to get a secured or a student credit card. I'm trying to be super careful of opening just any credit card since closing them is a no-go as it hurts your score. So I'm trying my luck for an unsecured credit card. I have no history, but I have a good income (\~155k) and have opened a checking and savings accounts with Chase and have a decent balance since my salary has been deposited there since I started my job (I save a lot). 

So, here is the plan I'm thinking about:

1. Apply for a Chase Freedom card right off the bat - I've read some people have been approved with no history but that having products with that same bank helps (at least to ask for a reconsideration if you get denied)
2. If I get denied, apply for the Apple Card - seems like they're approving people in the lower scores or no credit since it's a new product. 
3. If I get denied, apply for the Petal Card - they're fine with you not having a credit history. They'll look at your income and other accounts to determine your credit-worthiness.
4. If all of the above fails, I'll just get the Chase Freedom for students.

Am I insane? I know 1 and 2 will require hard pulls, but how much can my non-existent credit score drop by doing this? I've heard horror stories of people seeing their score drop 80 points for hard pulls but not sure is it's urban stories or something - considering how FICO works, it doesn't seem possible.","Getting a proper, unsecured credit card wth no credit history",1

Was considering CSR vs CSP but starting to think United Explorer Card would be good for me.   I already have the Priority Pass with AMEX Platinum but I do like the restaurant that CSR offers.  Not a fan of the $450 AF considering I pay $550 AF for AMEX.  I do know that the travel credit makes the AF $150 but still not a fan of having to write that $450 check.

With the news of AMEX Platinum and travel protection it kinda makes things a wash with CSR now.  I already get 2x pts with the Capital One card on any spend.   Not really a fan of starting a trifecta with Amex though.  Seems like better value with Chase Trifecta.

"So I rented a car from Hertz and the rental period ended 3 days ago. I paid the booking through priceline. I had a CSP so I thought I wouldn't need insurance but they deceptively stated in a way that I needed to purchase liability insurance which cost 120$ for 7 days. Later I found out my car insurance could cover it or I could decline since they had the minimum liability insurance which they both failed to mention (but since I signed apparently I'm screwed anyways).  Anyways, I know they charge  200$ deposit fee which I assume they took back because I don't see the 120$ charge for the insurance nor do I see a pending charge for it. I'm concerned they are going to try and scam me out of more money by making up some bullshit claim. I did take pictures of the car when I rented it but not as much as i should have. Should I call hertz and ask them when they are gonna charge it or maybe assume they forget it? i'm also thinking of closing the card and getting mailed another one so they can't charge me for anything more than the liability coverage or try and charge more for some bs. I don't trust these rental car companies because of all the stories I've heard personally and read on reddit.

"I have around $3,500 split between 2 cards, and having around $60 of my payments a month going toward interest is killing me. I've been wanting to get a balance transfer card, but my credit score is around 630, so I'm not that hopeful.

I know the popular cards are CSR/CSP, but honestly I only fly with SW and they're all short domestic trips.

I have a reasonable credit balance on a chase card and I have been carrying this for a while. I was looking into a balance transfer card to work on paying this off.

- Gas: BCF (3% cash back not 6%) (how many gas stations actually accept AMEX?)
- Everything else: QS (1.5% cash back) Use for insurance, misc. purchases, work reimbursements

Do most gas stations accept AMEX?

I make heavy use of price protection to the tune of maybe $1,000/year, give or take a few hundred. I've used the warranty once on a $250 cell phone, which was cool. I always feel better buying things that seem prone to breaking when I know I get extra time, and it seems way easier to get warranty coverage honored through CC than through manufacturer.

I have more AmEx MR and Chase UR than I know what to do with so I have no problem focusing on shopping benefits over more points. But my dilemma is which card.

I figure with the TravelBank card, I'll have 1 year of extended warranty and 90 days of price protection. This makes sense on paper, but the 1.5% TravelBank is mostly useless to me. Maybe I'll spend it someday -- I think it can also be redeemed on Southwest -- but I typically move AmEx MRs to Avios and redeem via BA/AA, or would use Southwest points, plus have a bunch of gift cards stockpiled. So TravelBank seems like a waste. But I do like that 90 days of price protection. But it comes with no warranty :(

On the flip side, the Wells Fargo rewards can be cashed out at 1%, which I hate to do, but it's better than nothing and will compound if invested, maybe 1.5% if I use on airfare. This only gives me 60 days instead of 90 days on price protection, but adds the 1 year of warranty, which I don't use often but am glad to have in case I need it.

So in the absence of having a detailed analysis of all my price protection claims and knowing how much extra I'd have gotten with 90 days instead of 60 days of coverage, it's hard to decide which is the better option.

For others who value these protections and the rewards, what would you do?","Trying to decide between Wells Fargo Visa Signature or Chase United TravelBank, primarily interested in shopping protections. Thoughts?",1
"Hello everyone,

I currently have the chase freedom student card, and never use it since I also have the Uber Visa card. Eventually I want to build the Chase trifecta, hopefully before I get out of college or at least soon after. Both of these cards are 3 to 4 months old. I also have an AU history of 5.5y on a sapphire preferred. Have about 7 years of banking at Chase. My 3 Bureau Scores are all between 695-725 approximately. 

I was wondering whether I should apply for a CF or CFU outright, or try to product change my student card to CF or CFU if possible. I currently don’t spend $20k a year, so I wouldn’t be able to take advantage of the CFU SUB. The CF is the less attractive of the two to me, but I would want it to build UR eventually. 

What should I do (if I even can)?

"About a year ago, I went online to [samsung.com](https://samsung.com) to buy the S9+ and did the 6-month financing option but I cancelled the order like 30 minutes later cause I found a better deal on Amazon. What happened was that samsung created a credit account for me and left the credit account open. Of course I never had to pay for the phone cause I cancelled the order. This invariably became a good thing for me cause it was an additional credit account that gets logged as me paying down a phone that I never ordered. Pretty much its boosting my overall credit score. I didnt even have a hard inquiry to do this either.

What I'm trying to figure out is that if anyone has a similar experience with other credit issuers so that I can do the same thing. Essentially open up credit accounts and just leave it running.

Reason why I'm doing it is just to boost my score overtime.

I travel once or twice per year and had  the CSP which I downgraded to CF an year ago. I have the Uber Visa, Amex Gold, BBP and CFU.

This worries because I have always made it a function to pay the card down in large chunks to make sure I wouldn't have any interest. The balance on the card has been pretty high because I have been using it heavily and paying it off. Will I be able to knock off the interest?

"I'm wanting to eventually get the Chase trifecta. I figured I'd start with the Freedom Unlimited and then work my way from there. I applied and was declined. I called the recon line and tried three different people and they wouldn't budge on it. The decline reason was too many inquiries. 

How many of these should I let drop off before applying again? I'd hate to try and apply early and get denied with another inquiry but I also don't want to wait two years if I don't have to. This is my senior year, so I won't need any more student loans. But also at the same time, maybe I should just let every hard pull purge and then start with a fresh slate. It's just that I already fly home to see my family three times a year and that trifecta would be nice to have. I know I'll probably have to wait a year minimum.

"First call of the day today, this lady got back from vacation and was having issues getting her computer to turn on. Apparently this issue isn't uncommon based on her explanation of why she doesn't shut the computer down very often.

Issue - Computer tower light comes on briefly for a second and then shuts right back off.  
Advice - Don't hold the power button; hit it and quit it.  
Result - Powers on without a problem.

Bigger Problem: She's been doing this method of powering on her computer for some unknown length of time prior to today and never realized that she shouldn't hold the power button. \~shrug.

Even though the main issue has been resolved, she requested I stay on the phone (as they all do) to 'verify it works' -- as if we didn't get further than she had before and already have a 200%+ productivity increase, but I'll amuse her. She gets to the point of entering her password and immediately--

""WELCOME!!"" She says, reading the screen.

Sooo out of the blue and in the absolute slightest pitch above the AOL Welcome of ages past. I had to mute myself to not laugh at her -- I don't think it was intentional, but warn me before you surprise me like that.

EDIT: In my defense, it was too early in the day for all the humor to have been drained from me quite yet.","Well, that was an early morning surprise.",0
"Blackberry environment upgraded, older devices will no longer work. Emails sent out to clients with older blackberry devices saying they will receive a replacement or they can opt out and go BYOD (bring your own device) and have their own device but still receive company email, manage their company calendar and contacts. Guy calls because he is unable to download an app for his favorite hockey team which allows him to use it to scan tickets for entry to the games, because it is blocked by company policy. I take over the call because he won't accept that we don't allow any app be installed on a device owned by the company. He states the device is now USELESS because he cannot get his hockey tickets, etc. on the device. I ask if he can get his email, call clients, see his calendar. Yes, he can do that, but cannot download what he wants to download. States if he had known this was a limitation of the new devices, he would not have upgraded (apparently, he was able to download a non-company app on previous device).  I let him know the older device would have stopped working. I offer him the information about using BYOD and now I am ""throwing out terms he doesn't understand like we think everyone knows what we mean"".

We also get calls when the older devices stopped working while on vacation because they never opened the box and activated the replacement device. Guess that's too much trouble, until on vacation and now it is a crisis.",Company-provided Blackberry is useless,0
"**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**

 &amp;nbsp;

**$Selben:** Me! A Tier II ~~helldesk~~ helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company, with a very skeleton-crew helpdesk. 10 of us total for 24-hour coverage (not including supervisors) to support 2500+ company-wide.

**$Snickers:** My cubicle mate, a good friend, and also Tier II.

**$Enraged_user:** The star.

**$Sup2:** All around great supervisor. Worked his way up from the support line and understands how the helpdesk works.

&amp;nbsp;

$Selben and $Snickers shared a bag of cheesy crackers, while giggling at videos on the Internet, and enjoying the quiet hum of machines with the occasional click of a mouse. All was peaceful in the early morning hours until…

The door to the IT area burst open.

$Selben dared peek around the corner only to lock eyes with $Enraged_user who pointed his finger and walked straight at him. Without hesitation, $Snickers had retreated into a pile of emails, leaving $Selben to fend for himself.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $Enraged_user: You! I need files moved to my flash drive!

He said this while shoving a personal drive at $Selben.

&gt; $Selben: I uh, sure… What files did you need moved?

He did not like the question, and angrily stomped his feet, checking over his shoulder.

&gt; $Enraged_user: Important company files!!!

$Selben’s eyebrow shot up at least an inch in pure confusion.

&gt; $Enraged_user: I’ll be back for those later!

He stormed off, leaving $Selben holding the flash drive.

&gt; $Snickers: Who was that?

&gt; $Selben: I… Don’t know?

&amp;nbsp;

Having no idea who the end user was or what they wanted, he left the flash drive untouched on his desk and went about his day. Around noon, $Snickers suggested they leave to get lunch. Upon their return, $Selben was caught on his way in by $Enraged_user, seemingly from nowhere…or possibly the bush by the door.

&amp;nbsp;

In a harsh whisper he spoke:

&gt; $Enraged_user: Where is the flash drive?!

He glared angrily.

&gt; $Selben: It’s on my desk. I wasn’t exactly sure…

He cut him off abruptly.

&gt; $Enraged_user: Bring it to me!

&gt; $Selben: Uh, okay?

&amp;nbsp;

The technicians passed through the doors, but $Enraged_user seemed to recoil like an invisible forcefield held them at bay (or he was avoiding cameras, $Selben later thought). $Selben retrieved the drive and headed back. As he reached for the door, $Sup2 walked in.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $Sup2: Hey $Selben.

&gt; $Selben: Hello! Just giving this to $Enraged_user really quick, and I’ll get back on the phones.

&gt; $Sup2: Oh? What’s on it?

&gt; $Selben: Nothing. They wanted some files but didn’t tell me what was needed.

$Sup2 let out a sigh, turned and opened the door, while holding $Selben back gently with one hand.

&gt; $Sup2: Get out of here $Enraged_user. You have to leave company property. They let you go man.

$Enraged user began to shout and angrily stomp his feet. He pointed his finger with an evil, knowing grin.

&gt; $Enraged_user: You’ll never get any of the company emails to the vendors. I REFUSE to give you my password!!!

&gt; $Sup2: We’re IT. We already changed your password. We have all the emails, bud…
 
$Enraged_user screeched like some sort of animal and threw himself to the ground in the most epic display of pure rage $Selben had ever witnessed, far surpassing a four-year-old having a meltdown in a $Pizza_rat game room.

&amp;nbsp;

After about 30 minutes, police arrived, and $Enraged_user was trespassed from the property. He had worked at the company for 10 years, but apparently had been using his company card for MANY personal expenditures and was let go.

$Selben is unsure if $Enraged_user was ever made to repay the company.",Unbridled Rage,0

"Two small related tales --

Yesterday, around 330PM  
The analyst two cubes over calls me over. The contractor who just started needs access to our system.  
She'd like to know why it wasn't done before he started and could we do it?

I take a quick look and notice that access to our system wasn't requested at all. Well, there's the problem.  An email chain has started, so I respond saying

&gt; Hi $ANALYST  
If you look at the request, access to $OUR_SYSTEM wasn't requested. Could you fill one out and get it approved? We need a paper trail, especially since $CONTRACTOR will be getting the same access as you.

Sure, that's fine, she expedites it, we grant it. Yay.  

Today, around 330PM. I'm working from home. So is the analyst. I get forwarded an email chain  
&gt; He $ME  
$OTHER_CONTRACTOR doesn't have access. Here's the request number. When will this happen?  
$OTHER_CONTRACTOR_BOSS wants to know.

Alright, let's pull up the request. Scan it briefly, access to our system wasn't requested. Poke at the fulfillment task, hey look, rights management told $OTHER_CONTRACTOR_BOSS that. Normally I hate rights management, but look, they're right.

So a response

&gt; Hey $ANALYST,
$OUR_SYSTEM access wasn't requested just like rights management told $OTHER_CONTRACTOR_BOSS. Can you expedite an access request?

But also, could y'all start reading your damn emails. I'm want to start just copy-pasting other teams'/coworkers' previous responses, see if people even notice the signatures, names, and positions change + don't match me.","We didn't do the thing that wasn't requested, no",0

"Customer comes with a desktop, he states that the video drivers won't work well, and he can't install them correctly, specially the latest update, almost 5 hours later the answer is found:

He bought a dogdy *XHVGA GTX 1060 6GB* from eBay, (because it was cheap AF) and the video drivers won't work because it's a GT 550Ti 1GB with a re-flashed chip that makes it show as a 1060

Installing 550's drivers works, but some games simply crash when they try to go upper that the 1GB of VRAM that the card has in reality

"When I was in college, I worked in the computer lab to earn extra money as a part of financial assistance. While the computer lab staff were there to provide assistance to the users, if it became clear that they needed hand-holding for an extended period, we had to hand them over to special services. We simply didn't have the people to be able to spend dedicated time with one user.

One day an older lady flagged me and asked for help writing a paper. It's not an uncommon request, the college that I attended had a program for older students, and many of them were unfamiliar with Word, etc.

I sat down beside her and told her to open Word.

Lady: ""How do I do that?""

Me: ""Take the mouse and move it so that you can click on the Start button in the corner.""

Lady: ""How?""

I took the mouse and demonstrated how it worked making sure to point out that movements of my hand/mouse matched the movements on screen.

She took the mouse in hand and started the journey to the start menu.

When I say journey, I mean it. As I watched, the mouse on screen moved in a slow series of ""S"" curves, slowly wending its way to the start menu. I kid not when I say that it must have taken her two to three minutes to find her way to the start menu. She turned to me.

Lady: ""Now what?""

Me: ""Do you see where it says Microsoft?""

Lady: ""Yes.""

Me: ""Move the mouse there and stop.""

Again, the mouse starts an arduous and long journey to the appropriate section. Her movements were so slow that each category opened as she moved past. After a couple of minutes, she finally arrived.

Lady: ""Now what?""

Me: ""Do you see where is says Word?""

Lady: ""Yes.""

Me: ""Move the mouse there and click the left button.""

Same drill. Slow meandering movements, but this time, she kept moving off of the submenu to the other categories, closing the submenu and opening the others.

Finally, after several failed attempts, she managed to open word. Once done, I turned to her and in my kindest, most gentle, non-condescending voice I could manage, told her that we would be happy to get someone from special services to tutor her in using the computer and that I couldn't because of limited personnel.

It made me afraid to know that she drives on the same roads that I did.

A lady with zero eye-hand coordination took 10 minutes to launch word.",How do I do that?,0
"TL;DR

Lawyer didn't believe me when I told him that his cordless phone was killing his connection to his router, even though I showed him a spectrum analysis.

\--

Back in the day when 802.11g was the standard, I worked for an ISP that I have mentioned in other posts.

A longtime customer of ours, a lawyer, called in one day stating that when he used his cordless phone, his wifi cut out. You can see this coming, I'm sure.

Facts: When we installed his system, he didn't want any holes drilled in his walls or cables running in channels along the walls. It didn't matter that we could make it really nice with wall plates and discrete channels that we could hide. His personal router was actually outside in a weather proof container so that there were no wires coming into the building. The phone in question was an add on to his existing wired phone network that gave him a weird keypad/headset system that he just \*had\* to have.

We had a WiSpy. Nice device. 2.4GHz analyzer that had a PC app. I took this and my laptop and headed out.

I setup and got the WiSpy up and running and showed him the graph, explaining that one of the spikes was his router and another was for our AP on the top of the hill behind him. (Ours was a point-to-point fixed wireless network with customer premise enterprise gear pointed at our AP, then hooked to his router. Standard setup for our clients.) The third clear channel (of which 2.4Ghz has only three, the rest overlap) was his neighbor's WiFi router. Since we strenuously avoided overlapping channels, the only option for his router was the channel that he already had.

While he watched the display, I had him take his cordless phone off-hook. Sure enough, a \*huge\* spike went right up through his connection to his router, at twice the power. What followed was an explanation of 2.4GHz history and why his router connection went offline due to his phone and how I couldn't change the router channel due to interference. I even showed him the graph while he turned on his microwave. It looked like a speech waveform all across the spectrum. Predictably, he didn't believe me and insisted that it couldn't have been his phone because ""it never did this before.""

When it became clear that he was unwilling to part with his beloved phone, I left, telling him to contact my boss, who would explain the exact same thing. I think that we got a couple more calls from him, but in the end, his complaints stopped.

"Yesterday I got a call to my L1 Service Desk and the caller was upset that his ticket wasn't resolved yet. Looked it up and saw that it was submitted the day before and escalated to our Desktop Level 2 group. We do internal tech support so when you are calling us, you are calling your co-worker.

Cast:

Me: me

AC: angry caller

Me: ""So I see here that this ticket was sent over yesterday to our Desktop group yesterday for them to investigate and resolve for you. While I don't see any notes since then, I can follow-up with them and have them reach out to you.""

AC: ""Well that's not working. You need to fix this NOW.""

(I examine the ticket to see if it is something we can fix, but the previous tech did everything we could, hence why it was escalated.)

Me: ""Okay, I did look over the ticket and the person you spoke to yesterday did everything we could do on our side, which is why they escalated it. At this point, the only thing I can do is to follow-up with desktop for you.""

AC: ""Are you deaf? I just said that's not working. I want to speak to your boss so he knows you're not trying to help me.""

Me: ""I am trying to help you the best way we can. Unfortunately due to company policy &amp; procedures, this is the only thing I can do &amp; when we do send the follow-up requests, my boss gets included on them anyway, so he would know about it.""

This went on for about another 5 minutes. Where he kept saying I wasn't listening to him and I would tell him I was, but our policy only allows us to do so much. Basically telling him he's not doing what he's saying I'm not.

AC (5 minutes later): ""Well since you're not going to help me, I'm going to go around you and get it done myself since you won't help.""

Me (ready to be done with this nutcase): ""Have a good day.""

After the call, I was good to my word and contacted the group (copying my boss in on it) &amp; looks like there was progress on the ticket since then. Really hope they pull that call and remind him that he shouldn't talk to co-workers like that, but I'm not holding my breathe unless he makes a big enough stink about it.

TL/DR: Customer confuses not being able to fix the issue at L1 with not wanting to help.","""Your not helping me""",0
"This just happened. I work internally at a small company, i've done years at the client facing end of tech support and you get to recognise very quickly those who are genuinely helpful and respect you when they need a problem solved, and there are others who believe you are some form of servant and never pay attention to information or alerts you give to them.

This person is one of the latter, i needed to hound him to bring him into line with the companies upgraded security proceedures, really important stuff from the CEO, but when he gets the slightest problem with the most basic of things the high importance emails start flying with the words acronym ASAP plastered everywhere.

his email "" For some reason I can’t print from my home printer. Is there any reason why this may be happening? Quite urgent that I print ASAP.""

my resposne ""sorry to hear that, are you working remotely on your office computer and trying to print on your home printer, or working just on the home computer? Anyway, let's do the quick tests first, can you do a test page from your home computer to the printer please? ""

him "" Yes, when working remotely from home. When I print nothing happens and then it would just say that it was redirecting print. There is nothing that pops on the screen now though""

me ""ok, but can you try the test print on your home computer, we need to check the basics first""

we then back and forth several times, him pointing the blame at a security app on his phone that went on 3 weeks ago, or new technologies that have'nt even gone in yet. but everytime never answering the same question ""can you print a test page?""

I'm not normally reluctant to do remote support sessions, they make life so easy, but this guy wants a remote session for everything no matter how minor. Things like releasing a spam mail from his quarantine, it takes three clicks, everyone else in the company does it themselves, but this guy thinks i am his butler. I'm getting to the point where i'm going to have to remote on to do the test page when i get the reply.

""printer says it's out of ink""

I can get away with a lot with the way i talk to colleauges, jokingly accusing them of smoking crack if they ask absurd things, as i never overstep the boundaries of respect, but in this case it took a lot of professionalism to not respond ""you could have saved yourself 20 minutes of complaining and 'this is really important' willy waving if you had listened!""

""",have you tried what i said?,0
"Background: I'm working with a technical client who use to work in our IT from late 00's up until 6 years ago and got promoted to a manager. Usually he is easy to deal with and I can talk to him without removing tech talk from the conversation as he helped to build a lot of our current setup back in the day.

The system is an external facing system with a very large customer base and a massive footprint in our infrastructure this is only dealing with one part of the system.

Note: anything in quotes has been changed to keep with the anonymity rule.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hi 'Client' I've been asked to call you as we need to talk about the amount of resources your servers in VMware are holding, mainly memory as we are dangerously low. I've done the research and I've come to the conclusion that each of your servers no longer needs 40gb of memory, since if you remember we split the load that these systems were processing from 2 servers to 6 servers over our two sites back in April, during the test we kept the same resources for the 6 servers as we had allocated in the 2 server configuration. I now want to lower each servers memory from 40gb assigned to 24gb assigned to each per server as they no longer need that much resources.

Client: well that is what the specs say on 'APP' documentation so we can't lower it.

Me: Yes I wrote and updated that documentation a year ago when this project began, if you look at the bottom of the article, it says based on a 2 system configuration and that resources should be scaled down if we ever decided to scale out the server infrastructure, when I wrote the documentation their was a possible plan to chop up 'APP' into smaller pieces and now that we have the load on a single server isn't what it use to be.

Client: I believe the systems still use all the resources so if anything we need more, we can't have the 'APP' going down.

Me: here is a graph showing memory usage on these servers from the last 6 months since we moved to a 6 server setup, on average the servers are consuming less then 10gb of memory and even at its peak when we lost our secondary site '2ndSITE' due to that large power outage, when we were operating out of '1stSITE' only for two days, each of the remaining nodes were only consuming 19gb of memory at their peak.

Client: well what happens if you lose both sites won't that mean that the servers will start consuming double those resources again and we still need 40gb of memory?

Me: (30 seconds of silence while my brain computes what they just said) Are you asking how much memory a servers would consume if we lost both of our sites at once?

Client: Yes wouldn't that mean the server would consume double the resources of the the already doubled load?

Me: (30 more seconds of silence as I felt a small trickle of blood well in my nose) Just to be clear you're asking if we lost both sites that host our servers due to a power outage or network outage like we did during the last power outage, you're asking how much resources would the server consume at that site when the whole site is offline?

Client: (30 seconds of silence on their end) ohh......... I'll address it with my team today and get back to you.","Just to be clear, you're asking how much resources would the server consume when the whole site is offline?",0
"Company/user all changed for obvious reasons..

I am part of an US based unmanaged support team and our customers have full access to their servers on the command line. I install and configure the operating system, any software they buy through us and then hand over the server in a virgin state for the customers to use.  From that point on I am responcible for hardware and network related issues only.

So customer logs a ticket and says that he has a plesk error, cant access his panel with the error

""ERROR: Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception: SQLSTATE\[HY000\]: General error: 1 Can't create/write to file '/tmp/\*\*\*\*""

I take a look at the server and is still responding on the network to ssh so its all intact. All good.

Me: "" I have just checked and you server is responding to ssh, so you are able  to login so you are able to log in and troubleshoot the issue further..""

NTWD:  ""sorry, but I don't know how to acces via SSH. Could you please help me to access with SSH? ""

Me: "" I use an application called putty when it starts up I simply enter the machines IP address into the application and hit return.Your server responds with a ""login as"" prompt so the server is  responding on the network and this would seem to be a server side issue.  This error would suggest that the server is unable to write to a /tmp filesystem, this could be because the file system is full or some other  error. Either way the you need to log into his server and investigate  further   ""

NTWD: "" Unfortunately I'm not a server specialist (just a simple web designer :-) ...)   Using putty, it's like using a remote desktop? I mean... I can see the folders of all the domain in that server?  I really don't know what to do...""

At this point I throw my minds eye hands in the air, the guy has a linux box without any clue on how to use it.  Understanding that its important that he gets access and that I can fix it remotely .. I offer a remote hands session as a purchased extra.

Me:  ""I can offer a remote hands service where I would log into the server and  perform a health check on the server's filesystem as the  error looks like its storage-related which I can investigate for you. ""

At this point he closed the ticket and that was the end of it, all he really wanted was for me to remote into his machine and make his problem go away.

I looked through old tickets and it seems like this guy was just using us as generic support instead of hiring an actual sysadmin. It looked like he had had the conversation about putty a number of times before..

"I'm not technically tech support, but people see me code sometimes which makes me the 'computer guy'. Not a big deal really, most of my colleagues know how to use a computer.

Anyway. One of my co-workers came to me that she couldn't log in. I came over to her desk and she showed me that at the login screen different letters appeared than that she pressed on the keyboard. My first thought was that the keyboard locale/lay-out was set to a different language. I quickly checked the settings but it was set to correct layout. 

My colleague pressed some more letters and I noticed that when she pressed 'w' an 'å' appeared. I immediately looked at the right alt key and pressed it a couple of times. It came unstuck and now the correct letters showed on the screen.
  
""How did you know it was the right alt key that was stuck?"" My co-worker asked. A few years ago I learned myself some Swedish, mostly through online courses. I quickly learned myself the keyboard shortcuts for ä, å and ö. So when I saw an 'å' appear when she pressed 'w' I saw the connection immediately.

Me: Ok, \*verifies account (realizes she doesn't really have our support for this issue so normally it'd be fee-based but sounds so simple and she is ***very*** insistent on getting some assistance, I figured it'd be easier to just help her and move on, faster the better)\* -- try just clicking, then holding the mouse, and dragging to select all the icons.

C: \*rambling\* I used to have them at the bottom of the screen, what do you want me to do? Click it and just drag it from the right, down to the bottom? That doesn't work they don't move at all.

Me: \*understanding taskbar now\* - Oh, you're saying your taskbar moved to the right! Okay, can you go ahead and right click on the time and date?

C: Ok, I clicked there, nothing came up, do you want me to just drag them?

Me: No, no, I need you to *right-click* on the time and date, we're looking for taskbar settings.

C: I don't see anything that says taskbar settings, I just see the time and date, do you want me to click on that?

Me: Yes, but ***right-click*** on the time and date, then tell me what comes up.

C: A calendar shows up, do you want me to click that?

Me: No, that's a left-click. I need you to do the other one, please.

C: Oh okay, I see toolbars, do you want me to click on that?

Me: No... at the bottom of the list, it'll say ""Taskbar Settings"" - go ahead and click that please.

C: I don't see that, but I see toolbars, show task view button, show people on taskbar... what do you want me to click? Should I go into Toolbars?

Me: No... we need Ta--

C: Oh I see, Taskbar settings, click on that?

Me: \*regretting this phone call in increasing amounts\* - Yes please and tell me what comes up.

C: It just says Taskbar.

Me: Ok good, that's where we want to be. You'll want to look through that list until you see ""Taskbar location on screen"".

C: I don't see that! But I see Taskbar, do you want me to click that?

Me: No, we're looking for ""Taskbar location on screen"" please, just read to me what you see on the screen.

C: \*huffs\* I see Taskbar, Lock the Taskbar is off, automatically hide the taskbar in desktop mode, automa... \*trails off\* ugh, I don't know what we're looking for. 

Me: You might need to scroll down a bit, again, it's Taskbar location on screen.

C: \*immediately scrolls to the very bottom\* I see People, show contacts on taskbar... but it says Taskbar at the top, do you want me to click on that???

Me: No, that's just text, a title for where we are, it's not anything you can click on, just scroll up a little bit, keep going up until you see ""***taskbar location on screen***"" Please!

C: It says Notification area... how do I customize the taskbars??? Click that?

Me: No, just two above that please just scroll up a ***liiiiiiittttle*** bit more...

C: Oh, I see it ""taskbar location on screen"" click it from right to bottom?

Me: YES PLEASE. \*insert warm, relieved, but semi-hurried goodbye and end call\*

"TL;DR

My manager couldn't be convinced that wired ethernet was more capable than wireless in almost every way, because the ""technology was always advancing!""

\-----

If you have read any of my previous posts, you will notice that one is about a small municipality. This municipality will be the subject of a few more posts, including this one.

At this municipality, IT didn't have a very big budget. As a result, we didn't always purchase the best of equipment. Case in point: the wireless routers were consumer grade and not integrated into the DHCP of the rest of the network.

My mistake: I edited an ISC dhcpd config file as the last item of the day and neglected to check the config for errors. Next morning no one but my boss (a mining manager by education) could get on the Internet. I forgot a "";"" and the server failed. I had a backup server, but I had made the config self-replicating, so no good. &lt;facepalm!&gt;

The fallout: My boss walked from person to person with his Surface and asked if anyone could get online. Since he was the only one on wireless, which used the AP DHCP server, he concluded that wireless was more reliable. When I came in, I found the problem and fixed it handily. Sure enough, within a few minutes, everyone was online.

Extended fallout: Now that my boss had it firmly in his mind that not only was wireless more convenient, but also more reliable than wired, we was making a push to do away with the cabling. When I tried to explain that a network switch was capable of handling far more data than even the best wireless access point, he would argue that ""the technology is always advancing!"" When I explained that the laws of physics prevented a wireless access point from handling the same amount of data as network switch, he argued that ""the technology is always advancing!"" When I again tried to explain how wired was almost always preferable for communication reliability, he didn't even let me finish. He just argued that ""the technology is always advancing!""

It didn't matter that I had, before this job, worked with one of the best in the business re: wireless technology. It didn't matter that one of the stock holders and architects of the wireless ISP for whom I worked previously was an engineer that had worked for NASA and knew \*exactly\* what he was doing. (In working with him it was immediately obvious. The fact that he worked for NASA didn't automatically qualify him.) It didn't matter that the IT director of a nearby municipality made the same argument regarding wired vs. wireless. In his mind, wireless was going to always be better.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

What was sad for me was that in the next couple of days, DLink or someone announced their first 802.11ac router that had beam forming, which would do directional wireless communication with compatible wireless cards, giving wireless something loosely akin to switching. Still though, not as good as wires. But, the technology is always advancing!",But the technology was always advancing!!,0
"**TL;DR-** Florida man realizes it's cold in Pennsylvania, wreaks havok with a space heater

&amp;#x200B;

So about 2 years ago, i banned space heaters from the customer service department in the company i work for. I'm not sure why in the 21 yr history of the company nobody has thought to do this before... but apparently i'm the super-genius that got tired of flipping breakers. Fast forward to this week... (mind you, it just turned autumn here, the lowest temp in the past 2 weeks has been like 65 degrees. not that cold.)  


Monday. Blown breaker. takes out half of customer service and part of our data entry team. Ok, we've had a lot of turn over in the past 2 years (even tho the manager has been here long enough to remember the ban hammer), so i send an email to that team reiterating that space heaters are not to be used.

Tuesday. Blown breaker. same story. another email this time with CAPS.

Today, 10 minutes after i walk in the door. One of our lead developers comes running into my office screeching that half the dev team has no power, and they all had a ton of stuff open that nobody had saved in days and they just lost everything and wtf is going on?! I hadn't had a sip of coffee yet, so my initial reaction was ""well you should all be better about saving your work."" I go flip the breaker again, and today we're going to skip the email and go straight to the source.

&amp;#x200B;

I Leroy Jenkins into the customer service office, un-sipped coffee still in hand, like a cop on a drug raid demanding everyone surrender their space heaters. A particular shift supervisor who has only been here about 6 months (and whom i passionately disdain) explains to me:  


$Sup- well i just sold my car and bought me and my fiance each a motorcycle. So tuesday it was raining and i got soaked on my way in and was freezing and this morning was really cold as well so i plugged in a space heater to warm up.

(this id10t was originally from florida and decided to move here to Pittsburgh for some reason, and then decided that a motorcycle was suitable for year round transportation)

$Me- Why the shit would you sell your car and buy a motorcycle and have no other means of transportation in Pittsburgh.... when the weather is turning?! wtf is wrong with you?! and you took out have of dev so they all want your head on a spike right now. NO MORE SPACE HEATERS, IDGAF IF THERE'S A BLIZZARD AND IT'S -10 OUTSIDE. NEVER. AGAIN.

"Got a call Monday while I was driving home that the MDF at one of our locations smelled like an electrical fire - Had a tech in the area go check it out and he reported that the MDF STUNK BAD, and that the main switch in the MDF was hot to the touch. I told him to unplug it and I'd replace it in the AM.

Got in an hour early Tuesday (OT) with one of my building techs - dropped the config on a replacement switch in my main building, drove it over and replaced the switch (I left the old one hung in the rack because poor cable management would've made it very difficult, I figured I'd pop in on a weekend (more OT) pull some patch cables and get it out then). I could barely smell anything that smelled like an electrical short, but every once in a while I'd catch a slight bit. I chalked that up to the powered off bad switch giving up the ghost.

Wednesday I got a call from the building that it started smelling bad in there again, my building tech cut his lunch short and when he got there he could smell something ""odd"" but they chalked it up to someone heating up broccoli in the adjacent room's micro, it wasn't overwhelming but it was definitely something. He checked it again before he left for the day and it smelled ""clear"".

Thursday AM, I get the call again, the smell was back! I grab some more tools, plan on pulling that old switch even if it meant bringing some endpoints down for a few minutes and we'll see why this powered off switch might still be producing an odor. I was able to cut a few zip ties (sigh) and I was able to wrestle the old switch out without bringing anyone down (yea!) The switch didn't smell at all. I stick my nose ALL over the place in that closet and I can't smell anything like an electrical fire or broccoli or anything. I felt all of the switches they all were slightly warm (about as warm as you'd expect a switch to be) and NOTHING.

It was a real head scratcher. . . .then I smelled it . . . but couldn't tell where it might be coming from, it wasn't the switches. I start putting my nose up to EVERY piece of equipment in the place and I found it - one of the external battery packs in our battery backup had that unmistakable odor - It was 2nd in line of a daisy chained set of 4 so I bypassed the battery (again without bringing anything down) and pulled the pack out of the rack it was HOT. we finally found the culprit. we took the battery pack out back and opened it up and 4 of the 9 batteries were extremely swollen

The head unit of the backup charges the external batteries on a schedule - - - and it was only when it was charging that the batteries that would produce the smell - that is why I was never able to smell it. . .

Now I have to check the batteries on a few dozen of these units and get replacements - - - this was not budgeted for this year!!!","The Switch, The Broccoli, and the Battery",0
"Hello TFTS. First time posting. In honor of Halloween coming up, I thought I'd share the scariest tech support story I have. It's 100 percent true and is my favorite story to tell my end users around this time of year. I still get chills thinking about it.

\-----------------------------

Background: It's early in my career and I've started working at a help desk. One of my friends is a nanny for a couple and she invites me to get coffee because she has a scary story and doesn't know who else to tell. Names have been changed.. aside from Rupert.

Me: HelpMeAssistYou

Lisa: Nanny and Friend

M: Mother of the children she cares for

D: Older daughter, 4 years old

NS: Newborn Son

\------------------------------

After getting our coffee we sit down.

Me: So, what's this story you have for me? You sounded pretty shaken up.

Lisa: Well, yesterday I was taking care of D and NS and D went down for her nap. When I walked by her room to check on her, she was singing, ""Blood, blood from the baby, it's okay he wanted to play. Blood blood from our mommy, that's okay she died today.""

Me: \*wide eyes\* What... the fuck?

Lisa: I KNOW. So, I sat her down and asked her where she learned that song and she said she learned it from her imaginary friend, Rupert. She said he talks to her sometimes and they sing together, mostly at night.

Me: That's insane.

Lisa: I know, so I asked M about it and she said that D has been saying that for a while and that Rupert has been apparently trying to get her to get up in the middle of the night, go to NS's room and get him out of the crib to be in her room.

Me: How long has this been going on?

Lisa: Ever since they brought the baby home. There's no way she could have learned that unless someone told her. Her parents don't watch anything that would trigger that and she's very well sheltered.

Me: \*After leaning back and thinking for a while\* Wait... Oh fuck.

Lisa: What?

Me: When they brought him home, did they buy new baby monitors?

Yes. That was it. We called the family and had them check it out. The monitors didn't record, but they could move and also have audio output. They waited until night, then stood outside the daughter's door until they heard a man talk over the monitors and start singing to her. Immediately, they unplugged them and called the police, but there was nothing that they could do to trace the guy. I walked them through two-step authentication on Nest units after that and Rupert hasn't come back. Fucking sickos, man.

"I'm still a bit rattled by the fact that this somehow happened in 20-fucking-19.

**tl;dr: User thought he had technological telepathy.  User was wrong.**

Buddy needs a password reset.  Simple call, NBD 2 minutes and it's done.  But oh no.

The whole thing starts when the password I sent doesn't work.  I figured maybe I'd fat-fingered it so I reset it again to the same thing.  Still no dice.  Guess I have to figure out what's going on over there.  Sounds like a PEBCAK to me.


###Chapter 1: Trying to get the computer name

So the user doesn't have the standard bginfo wallpaper and his PC name isn't showing there.  No biggy, right?  So I get him to right-click the start menu and click system.

Nope.  The ""System"" choice isn't there...  He's got two totally different choices instead.  No idea what the hell he's clicking on.  Figured I'd try to guild the call a bit further.

**Me**: Okay, maybe you're on one of the legacy systems.  Is your start button a circle, or a flat square with the windows logo?  
**User**: Oh, I guess it's a circle.

**Me**: Ok, no prob - left-click the start button and click on ""Computer"" on the right-hand side of the screen  
**User**: Hmmm... um... nope, not seeing it there.

Mother of god damn fucks... here we go!

**Me**: Okay, so there's another way we can find this.  Left click the start menu to bring it back up again.  Then type in ""CMD"" like ""Charlie Mike Delta"" and hit enter.  
**User**: Okay.  I have a black box on my screen.  
**Me**: Okay, perfect.  Now, type the percent sign, then 'computername' as all one word, then another percent sign  
**User**: Hmm, not following you.  I don't see any percent sign there?  
**Me**: No, you need to type that in.  It isn't on the screen.
**User**: Oh.  
**Me**:  Okay, start with the percent sign.  Shift-5 to enter it in.  
**User**: Okay, percent.  Enter.  'percent' is not recognized as an internal or external command...  
[**Mentally**: Are you FUCKING kidding me right now!?]  
**Me**: No no, percent, computername, percent.  
**User**: computername percent.  'percent' is not recognized as an internal or external command...  
**Me**: No.  Type in ""Computername"" as one word, but sandwich it between percent signs.  One on each side.  
**User**: I'm not following  
**Me**: Okay, I'll email you what to put in.  [emails user a 1-liner `%computername%`]
**User**: [computer name] is not...


Fucking hallelujah!

###Chapter 2: Champ Boogaloo

So I connect on, and I shit you not, the user was literally typing ""percent"" the first few times.  Despite me saying ""shift-5"".  Despite me saying ""percent computername percent"".  Ho my gah.

Also, the user was on Windows 10 - so we can also safely confirm he can't distinguish a square from a circle...

###Chapter 3: How is computer used?

So here we are - finally at what I've been after.  I take the user over to the system to see what's going on.  Sure enough, user types in a password, and the system doesn't take it.

I get him to type it in again and notice he's only typing in maybe half of the number of characters in the password... so I go to his email... and there's a bunch of unread emails - one of which being the password email I sent him.

**Me**: Are you sure you're entering in the password from the email?  
**User**: Yes, and it's not working  
**Me**: ...What are you entering?  
**User**: H-e-l-l-o  
**Me**: You're literally just typing in the first word from the email as seen in the summary.  You need to open the email to see the password I set.

[**Mentally:** Jesus mother of fucks, how the fuck is somebody this dense.  It's 2019.  HOW!!??  How do you manage to even make it through a standard day!?]

Sure enough, the user was able to get in after using the right password.

Me: Alright, can you please unplug it and leave it out for 10s, then plug it back in.

"I know this is long, but it is worth the read.

&amp;#x200B;

What seems like a lifetime ago, I worked for a small point-to-point fixed wireless ISP. We'd go to a customer site and install a fixed antenna that pointed to a node of our network of wireless towers. I was combination sysadmin, repair tech, and field tech. I \*loved\* that job. I would probably still be there if the company hadn't been sold. 

&amp;#x200B;

I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

One day a guy brought in a computer from a well known company that rhymes with smell. The computer was in a commodity style case. I don't remember the model. The customer was complaining that the computer couldn't connect to the monitor. I was assigned the case and I started to hook up the machine. Since I knew the layout pretty well, I wasn't really paying attention to the ports, just plugging them in half by memory. When I got to the VGA port, I saw the problem -- the guy had RIPPED OUT the VGA port from the motherboard! All that was there was a few of the traces that went to the pins on the connector. The connector was just GONE. My guess is that the thumb screws were tight and when it wouldn't come out easily, he resorted to yanking on it.

&amp;#x200B;

It did have a PCIe x16 port, but since there was onboard VGA, I would have to disable the onboard, in the BIOS that I couldn't get to, before I could plug in a third party card. I tried anyway, but to no avail. I know there are cards that will allow you to see the BIOS post over a serial terminal, but we didn't have one of those.

&amp;#x200B;

I called the customer and, trying to professional, I explained that we couldn't repair this and that the motherboard would have to be replaced. Since all the other components appeared to be in good shape, I offered him a choice. 1. We could get a third-party board for a good price that would do very well and accept all of the remaining components and would fit in the case. 2. We could order a motherboard from Smell for that model and wait for it to come in. It would take a while and would probably cost three times as much.

&amp;#x200B;

The customer insisted that he have the Smell despite my gentle coaxing toward option 1. So I got out my company credit card and called Smell.

Me: There is no need to check these things. I know the problem: the VGA port has been forcibly removed from the motherboard. I need to order a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Ok. When he comes in tomorrow, get the approval and call my company cell phone. Here's the number. I don't care that it is a Saturday. Call me so that I can order this motherboard.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: (Trying not to growl) No. Thank you. 

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: Thank you for calling Smell. Have a great day.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I tell my boss the whole story, in short because he heard most of it. He explains that they can't sell me a motherboard without approval because if a warranty claim comes in for the system and they don't have a motherboard for it, they will be on the hook for a new system.

&amp;#x200B;

(EyeRoll) This system was a few years old. Any warranty from the factory would have long been expired. Since most people don't tend to order the extended contracts, the likelihood of a warranty claim coming in was low. Still I would have to wait.

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday comes and goes. No call.

&amp;#x200B;

Sunday comes and goes. No call.

&amp;#x200B;

Monday comes and finally someone calls me about noon or so.

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: Thanks for you patience. I can now take your order.  &gt;:-( 

&amp;#x200B;

To sum up: I order the motherboard. As predicted, it is about three times the price of a third-party motherboard. It takes about a week for it to get to me. I switch everything over, test the system and call the customer who comes and pays and leaves with his machine.

&amp;#x200B;

There are just some people who should \*never\* be allowed to use a computer.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

&amp;#x200B;

Customer with more strength than brains rips the VGA port from the motherboard and wants to pay through the nose for a replacement part, even though there are less expensive options. The manufacturer doesn't want to sell me the item for fear of not having supply on had for a warranty claim that won't happen. After getting approval from the manufacturer, I am able to order the part, fix the machine and return it to the customer.

OWD: Why are there these icons on my desktop? I don't want them there, I don't even use them! When I delete them they just come back! They're distracting and keeping me from doing my JOB!!!

SU: Those are a part of your department's group policy, just move them out of the way and ignore them if you don't use them. Closing ticket.

&amp;nbsp;

Time passes, my supervisor leaves and now I am the one who knocks

&amp;nbsp;

OWD: What the hell is ""group policy"" and how does it help me do my job! I want these icons gone! They're distracting!

Me: Hello OWD! *explains what group policy is in a friendly and helpful manner.* So unfortunately there's nothing I can do for you other than what SU suggested, however... If you'd like I can escalate to... the SYSTEM ADMIN. 

Now I am not normally such a petty man but the ""what the hell is gRoUp PoLIcY"" comment really sparked my ire for this unfortunate soul.

OWD: Yes, I would like that.

Me: *shrugs, moves ticket to sysadmin queue*

The sysadmin is a busy man and does not care to be bothered by such things. After a couple of days letting it marinate, OWD sends *another* ticket in for the same thing. SA sees it and instead of replying, he calls OWD.

SA: Hi OWD, would you be able to come to the IT office so we can discuss your, uh, tickets? Great, thanks.

(Just a minor note, but OWD is in a building across the street and about a block down the road, so he has to hoof it all the way here)

OWD goes into SA's office and the door shuts. I hear very little except for snippits of ""wasting our time"" and ""used by your department"" and ""move them out of the way"".

OWD comes out a few minutes later, head down, looking both upset and humbled, and quickly leaves.

SA: close his tickets, the issue is resolved.

Me: you got it boss!

"Every 6 months or so I get asked for the story about my flair and usually just post a TL;DR in the comments. Today's the day I release the full monty. Please bear in mind that this happened over a decade ago, so the dialog has been changed to infect the innocent.

Once upon a time, there was a (now defunct) national photography company that rented space in another (nearly defunct) retail company. Let's call them DeathGlance and KD Nickles respectively. Although it could just as eaqually have been called Roland Hills and J\*Mark. I'll leave the decision up to you.

This photography company hired and trained ""professsional"" photographers from the same general pool of college-age kids and empty-nesters as the retail store, so you can only imagine the level of technical aptitude.

Said photography company also had a problem. Their robotic camera system was approaching year 12 of a 5-year projected lifespan and broke down constantly. To staff enough traveling repairpeople to service the dying cameras would be too expensive to make what little profit margin remained in an industry that was already circling the drain. Their solution: Push all but the largest repair tasks on the photographers.

Now to be fair, this system was exceptionally well designed, and was awarded several patents back in its heyday. Most of the repairs that had to be done were no more involved than swapping out a controller box with an idiotproof connector, or occasionally having to lift a 20 pound camera and detach it from its mount.

&gt; ME: Well, the bad news is that's a hard error, so we can't override it. The good news is that I can get you up and running in about 5 minutes without ending your shoot as long as you haven't turned the room off and on. This particular part shakes loose about once a month, but never breaks.

&gt; AHM: Nope, I haven't done that. We've got some good pics on this shoot and I didn't want to restart from scratch.

&gt; ME: OK, good. Let's grab your flathead screwdriver from the toolbox and take the top access hatch off the camera.

&gt; AHM: Um... What's a flathead screwdriver? I have a yellow one.

*Face, meet Palm. Palm, say hello to Face.*

&gt; ME: I'm not sure what the actual color is, but it's the one that isn't a square or a star.

&gt; AHM: So the plus-sign one?

&gt; ME: No, is there a minus sign one?

&gt; AHM: OK I've got it.

&gt; ME: OK, now take the top hatch off, and let me know when you're ready for the next step.

&gt; AHM: OK it's off now.

&gt; ME: Look in the bottom center of the circuit board and push in on the little square there.

&gt; AHM: Uh there are like 4 squares there and a circle.

&gt; ME: The one closest to you in the middle.

&gt; AHM: I'm not going to get shocked, am I?

&gt; ME: Nope, the camera runs on low voltage. It won't shock you, and even if it did, it'd be about the same as licking a 9-volt battery.

&gt; AHM: OK, It's back in now.

&gt; ME: Good, now put the hatch on again, and hit Cancel on the camera.

&gt; AHM: Allright, it says READY now.

"&gt;**Dr. Seuss:** Hey guys, the network's down at $TooCoolForSchool and we have testing in the morning, can someone please check it out asap?  
  
Poor, poor $2C4S. The demigods of luck have been fickle with them; most recently the crazy summer rains caused water damage that turned to mold in a section of the building that wasn't used over the summer, so bye bye switch. I was suspecting that as the actual cause as I knocked on the door and Dr. Seuss let me in.  
Sure enough, the closet was doing its best blinkenlights. We'd had more than one client pull a ""plug both ports on an IP phone into the wall"", in some cases multiple times, so I started from the firewall and worked my way down as I talked.  
Dr. Seuss physically confirmed no one had done such a thing - and blessedly, is one of those unicorns that's just tech savvy enough *and* sensible enough to know their limitations that I could trust them. But several ports, linked to parts unknown, were crashing the network as soon as they were plugged in. And unfortunately, because of $Reasons, we did not have credentials to the switches, so I couldn't track down the culprit logically either. We were able to at least get partial connectivity and I promised to send someone their way in the morning.  
  
I discussed it the next day with Graybeard, their lead tech. My theory was either the mold had gone sentient or lightning had claimed another victim - just that past week we'd had three switches and a firewall fritz and die because of it. Graybeard was sticking to the loopback theory - he suspected a couple of 5-port switches in labs as the culprits. But both were going to require some legwork, so he recruited the bright-eyed intern HK-47, and ~~slew the seven daemons to reclaim the Thrice-Stolen Sword of Directional Input~~ found a cable toner. I wished him luck and returned to my normal duties.  
  
Graybeard called me later that day, laughing. Not quite ""ha-ha funny"" laughing.  
You see, because of aforementioned $Reasons, we had not done the cabling for much of the school, nor our usual vendor. And one of the summer projects had been adding new APs, of a particular brand that has two ports on the back. Whatever walnuts did the cabling, looked at the two ports, decided they were equal and ran two lines to each AP.  
Not only that, but just prior to the weekend, we had done an update of the controller and firmware for said APs. Which apparently changed the default behavior of said APs for handling their ports...  
In short, upon rebooting, each AP decided it was a switch and that newfangled STP wasn't worth it, thank you kindly.  
  
Graybeard took the expedient solution, and unplugged half of the new ports. Connectivity was restored and students were plagued with tests once more.

Last year I worked for an IT Servicedesk at a University, apparently the City Services Servicedesk in the same city had a similar phone number (two digits were switched at the end or near the end, like 40 and 04). So a lady called and I was the one to talk to her.

Lady: I need some help with a document on the intranet (company environment for documents and information).
I have talked you your colleague earlier today.

Me: I might be able to help you, do you have a reference number?

Lady: No, where should I find this?

Me: That would be in your mail, if you don't have one, I can look this up in our system via your name.

Lady: Sure, my name is [Name]

Me: Can you spell that?

Lady: Sure, (and she spells her name)

Me: My system doesn't find a match. (We worked with a system where the name field can auto-complete the first name that comes up, but we can continue typing. Like someone's name is Bryan Jones, we can type ""Br"" and the system says Brian Smith, typing a ""y"" can complete to Bryan Connor. A drop down menu gives all the suggestions possible with the letters we typed.)

Lady: I'm sure that I called, I talked to (name of colleague, which happens to be a common first name in my country).

Me: (trying to do several checks with different search boxes). I can't seem to find your name. Can I have your login ID, maybe our system has entered you with a typo (it happens, like the ""IJ"" was sometimes entered as ""Y"".

Lady: (somewhat confused) ehm... Do I need that login ID?

Me: Every employee has one for the systems here on the Uni.

Lady: Eh... But I don't have one.

Me: Are you an employee or student of the University?

Lady: (somewhat confused) Why should I be one?

Me: You're calling with the IT department of the University

Lady: Oh, now I get it. Sorry, I thought that I was calling with the City Services Servicedesk hahaha

"I got tons of good stories for this sub.  Here's one:

We have a print shop as a customer.  They make posters, booklets, stationary, etc.  We get a call from one of them, similar to the following:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;C: Hey, our Graphics workstation isnt turning on

This computer is an older G5 Powermac (the tower version).  At this point, this machine is probably 4-5 years old.  I walk through all the standard stuff, make sure cords are plugged in, etc, monitor, power strip on, everything seems OK.  We send someone out there, and as near as we can tell, the machine is dead.  They asked us to bring the machine back to the office and see if we can get any  data off of the drives.  We do, bring it back, and following some diagnostic procedure plug the machine in to see if there's fan spin or any indicators of life.  Turn it on, comes on and boots with no issue.  We did discover the machine was almost unusably slow (word took 15+min to launch), but that was another issue entirely.  

We call, tell them it's working, and bring it back.  Hook it up, it's dead again.  At this point, we're getting really frustrated, and take the machine to another outlet, plug it in, and it works fine.  What the hell?  We plug in a fan at the outlet the machine originally used, it works fine with no issue.  Go take another computer, hook it up there, boots with no issue.  Bring the Mac back there, refuses to turn on.  

We could never figure out why this suddenly started happening, I think they ended up just running an extension cord from the other side of the room for the rest of the time they had that computer.",Bad outlet??,0
"For context: I work at a small IT MSP employing about 7 people, even with our small size projects tend to get siloed to certain people and I occasionally get thrown into the mix when a big hardware install needs to happen since I have the most familiarity with the physical stuff.

I come into the office and before I've even logged in I'm handed a 1U dell r420 and told I'll need to drive to a client about 60 miles away and install it as a temporary loaner server, this client in particular works in a specialized field where they need enterprise IT gear but there's only about 3 people at the company and it's a home office. I'm given this 1U server and told to go install it, configure it with a static IP, and let our outsourced engineer team know the IP so they can remote in. I head out there and set it up and the second I turn it on the fans ramp up to take off speeds, briefly come back down as Windows starts loading, and then immediately ramp back up and stay pinned at that level. Now normally this wouldn't be a *huge* deal but this server was going in the client's office. I'm standing there giving it the stink eye when the client walks into the room and yells to me over the incredible racket ""is it going to do this all the time?"".

Now, I had heard this thing from the basement in the office but I just figured they were running prime95 on it or something to stress test it. 1U servers tend to be on the noisy side but they shouldn't be hearing protection loud when sitting idle at the desktop. Confused, I fire up open hardware manager to find that processor 0 is at 95 degrees basically always and processor 1 is sitting at 20. Clearly something's wrong, maybe the chip is reporting it's temp wrong? I decide to shut it down and take a look to see if I can see anything funky inside the machine. I pop open the cover to the server and carefully touch my finger to the heatsink for processor 0 and it's ice cold, not only that but it moves a little when I do it. Now, given that we've deployed this server before it took me a second to connect the dots that a heatsink shouldn't do that. I poke it again and it's wobbling around. Taking the shroud off I grab the heatsink and am able to lift it entirely off the board, it isn't even screwed down. Low and behold on the bottom of it is one of those perfectly sized squares of machine applied thermal paste that the heat-sinks come with. 

I'm not talking ""oh there was some left over thermal paste on it"" no, it was a from-the-manufacturer machine applied square of it. The processor, of course, was totally clean. No tale-tale stains or anything. Somehow Dell had QC passed this server, shipped it to us, and we had deployed it in the past with the heat sink just kind of set over the processor, no actual contact. Somehow between Intel's thermal throttling and the fans pushing enough air over the bare heatspreader it had managed to not die. 

In total disbelief I fetched my screwdriver and for the first time in this R420's life actually fully installed the heatsink for processor 0 and upon firing it up what do you know it's idling at 35 now and the fans don't sound like they're from pratt and whitney anymore.

I want to point out, this server was sitting in our basement like this whining away as we installed 1tb ssds, had it build a small raid array, fresh installed server 2016, and set up various bits of software on it **for the better part of last week**.",1U Jet Engine,0

"I'm not really in a tech support role at my job, but I know this really amazing trick where you google error messages and follow instructions to fix problems, so I'm the go-to person whenever something isn't working.

I recently put in my notice and they decided not to replace me, so I'm training one of my coworkers to take over some of my workload. Like me, this coworker doesn't have a background in IT, but unlike me I don't think she's willing to put in the work and learn the minimal amount of things she needs to know to get by.

I've already told my manager (via email, cc'd to multiple people so my ass is covered) that I don't think she's a good fit and they should hire someone else for this role. They refuse to take my advice, but hey at least I get some funny stories for the internet.

Last week I walked this coworker through one of our processes: upload an excel file to our company website and generate various reports. It's really simple stuff but many employees struggle with this system so I wanted her to get familiar with it and all possible issues that might arise, since she will be tasked with helping users.

After I've shown her an example, I tell her to try creating an excel file and go through the process on her own. I leave for 5 minutes and when I come back she immediately calls me over and says it's not working.

"This is a request from another thread.  I posted an anecdote about a Twitter bot run by a company I used to work for, and was asked to make a full post out of it.

So here goes...

At the time, I was working as a NOC tech for a company known for math software.  They run a Twitter bot where you can submit code snippets by tagging the bot, and the bot will parse the code, render a graphical result, and post it back to Twitter.  It's a neat little tech demo for the product.

The bot lived on a VM in the production environment, and the guest didn't have a lot of resources allocated; it didn't see too much traffic, so even though it was doing some potentially computationally-intensive work (3D graphics were a very common thing to render), it wasn't in use enough to warrant a lot of allocation.

The code for the bot was also a bit on the rough side.  Its logging was particularly noteworthy; it logged all activity - without timestamps - to a single file, and had no rotation set up, either on the application or OS level.  It also didn't have any checks in place as to who it was replying to; there was a moderation team responsible for removing the occasional troll post where people would tweet to it with offensive usernames, or similar.  There was also a problem with the bot replying to itself; if you included the bot's name in the message, the rendered result would be picked up by the bot and queued for another reply.  We had discovered this by accident, and the developer said that it wasn't a big deal (big mistake).

Despite all of that, it worked well enough, and was spotlighted sometimes by news articles, and the occasional contest run by the marketing department.

Well, one day, the marketing department went to drum up some publicity, and posted a tweet from the main company account, tagging the bot's account.  Then they send a follow-up tweet from the bot's account, quoting the original reply.

This results in a tweet with two mentions of the bot's name.

And this goes about as well as you might expect, for not-polished code without proper error checking.

The bot fires off a response to itself, rendering the result. Which triggers a response, and another render, and... well, you get the idea.

The guest VM running the bot, having never been provisioned for this kind of capacity (rendering several tweets every second), goes absolutely haywire.  It maxes the CPU and memory consumption quickly, which starts to generate errors.  The single (very large, at this point - on the order of several GB) log file starts to bloat.  And the VM environment starts to hang because of all of the traffic (it wasn't designed to handle that kind of I/O).

Thankfully, we managed to kill (almost literally; Force Stop and the VM's disk ended up moderately corrupted because of it) the VM guest before it got too out-of-hand.  And Twitter actually suspended the bot, which also put a stop to it.

A poor intern still ended up having to delete - by hand! - several thousand tweets.  It took them a few days.

The bot developer, meanwhile, learned a valuable lesson about what constitutes an ""edge case"" (and why you don't ignore them).  And ""error handling""...",Infinite Loops are Edge Cases?,0

This app needs the normal Active Directory username and password. I ""install"" the web app to his phone, and ask him to log in.

"I work for my local city, and we have City Council Meetings twice a month.  The room is set up with a projector, and microphones for the Elected Officials and Company up atop a dais.  There is a podium centered in front of them below, and a desk off to the side for a laptop feed to the projector.  Whatever engineer designed this system thought having the control box inside of the podium was a good idea.  All of the microphones and VGA feeds go to that, instead of the closet with the rest of the equipment.  If the Podium isn't plugged up, half the things won't work.

Customer calls in saying that his sister has an phone with iCloud lock. The phone shows the first letter of the email address and the bit after the @ related to the iCloud account as a hint.

He called us yesterday and we sent him an email change the password for his sister's account (after identity verification).

Today, he calls in because he has managed to change the password, but has forgotten what account it's related to.

**Note**: If they don't know the full email address, we can tell them what it is if we find it and we pass account verification, which is what I assume happened here.

**M: Me C: Customer**

**M:** ""So you're saying you've changed the password but can't remember the account it's related to? When you changed it, it says on the page when you create the new password.""

**C:** ""I know, but I've forgotten.""

**M:** ""Well, doesn't your sister know? She's the owner of it.""

**C:** ""She is, but she's forgotten what it was too!""

While this is happening, I try to find any information but I find nothing. Can't find a case number, their emails return no results, their phone numbers link to accounts they own but not the one we want, I have no idea how the other account was found.

**M:** ""Check the password reset email we sent. Is it not there?""

**C:** ""No, it has the dots covering it too!""

**M:** ""Did we send any case number? Do you remember the name of the person you spoke to?""

**C:** ""You didn't and I can't remember who I spoke to, it was a man.""

I'm getting desperate. I put them on hold, ask on our chat if anyone has spoken to them, but nothing. It's as if that call never existed but all the details he tells me add up, it's not some sort of prank call. At this point, I've run out of options.

**M:** ""Sir, you and your sister, have a good, long think about what you did earlier today and try to remember the email address. Or else you're going to have to send us your proof of purchase to remove that account.""

**C:** ""But my sister has all her photos on that account...

"Hi TFTS, this is a tale about a $School I remember going to.

It isn't the same $School as last time. It has about 1000 students, proper IT, Azure AD, Office 365... lots of stuff.

Cast:

$Teacher: a good teacher of Music. Doesn't click all buttons he finds, doesn't unplug random cables because they're ugly, doesn't think that the network fix you did broke the mouse, respects that IT is just better with computers. Recently moved classrooms, now he's in the most isolated room of the entire school. No wifi, only an ethernet port. But at least he got a printer of his own...

$Me: a person (student) with some technical skills, no admin privileges, no knowledge of the network, no employment contract, but is known as 'the guy that fixes computers'.

Story:

I get into class with this teacher and the subject starts. When we get into a more open section of the class, where we learn different musical instruments by ourselves (with assistance from $Teacher), he just casually mentions:

$Teacher: Oh, just by the way, my printer's broken, $Me. You can look at it if you want, but I doubt that you'll be able to do much; IT came down here and they didn't know what to do with it either, so if you want to look...

$Me: (in my head) Well that doesn't mean a whole lot. (to $Teacher) Alright, I'll see what I can do.

I come to the PC and get a more detailed description of the symptoms.

$Teacher: It says it's offline, and when I print to it, it just... doesn't print. That's been happening since the friday a week ago. IT added this other printer for me, but it's a 5 minute walk away, and that's just a pain.

$Me: Yeah, I can imagine.

I confirm the symptoms (14 print jobs pending...) and check that the printer is on. I print a test page to it, nothing. Drivers are working, and another (networked) printer using the same driver works. I reboot the printer. It starts up fine, I can even open the settings. I glance at the back and see a USB cable going to the PC (this printer is a network printer, but $School is using USB for it. I knew that, as I helped move the printer 2 weeks ago).

$Me: Alright, I'll try switching the USB port the printer is using.

I plug the printer into a different port, but nothing.

Wait, what? Nothing? Not even a ding to indicate a new device being plugged in?

$Me: Looks like something's wrong inside the printer which is preventing the USB port from working. But it supports the network, it even has Wifi written on it so... it should support the network. I'll see about the ethernet port...

I look closely behind the printer and see a Wifi logo on a sticker. Under it lies a USB port, presumably for a Wifi dongle. So much for wireless. Looking at the Ethernet port...

$Me: Wait, that's... no way.

I unplug the network cable from the ethernet port. And find a USB B connector. Apparently, the USB cable from earlier was plugged into the ethernet port. With my glance, all I saw was a cable, not the connector. To my surprise, it actually fits pretty well in there. I plugged it into the USB port and the printer came to life.

$Teacher: Oh uh, probably cancel that, there's a few print jobs, one of which has about 100 pages.

I cancel the current printjob from the printer, take out the cable, cancel the other print jobs from the PC (about 130 pages in total, but that's not unexpected for this school and subject) and plug it back in.

It reminded me how the day before, I tried to force a Displayport cable into an ethernet port.

Tying up some loose ends:

Who did this one? I'm guessing some kids from the school.

Why did they not find out? I heard from the teacher that they only checked the software on the PC after the lesson. Yeah, that's stupid but...

Tl;Dr: Printer cable is plugged into the ethernet port. IT has no idea how to fix it.",USB vs RJ45 = clueless IT,0
"This one is pretty short and sweet, and a lesson I learned as well.  


Had a lady call in with printer problems, and of course the first troubleshooting that is easiest is just power down the computer, unplug the printer, and unplug the router, right? From my experience, fixes a lot of the issues I get regarding printers. Well of course when there are cords, when aren't there problems?  


This lady apparently had two boxes, one for her modem, and one for her router is what I assumed. I'm not her ISP and have no knowledge of her in-home setup, and... surprise surprise, neither does she. We got the computer powered down, the printer unplugged, but she isn't sure which box to unplug for the router. Now mind you, during this, I was assisting two other customers on chat and thought process probably wasn't the best at the time, but I kinda just went f'it and told her to just unplug both.

***dead silence***

Hello? ...hello? Hmm, hellooo...? ...*crap*.  


Whoops, apparently indicated she should unplug her phone line too. Bye bye phone call!

Soo it wouldn't be a bad idea to familiarize yourself with the naming of what is what in your house, and (as a tech) not recommending to unplug things you don't know what they are for certain haha.

  
(She did call back and we were able to get the printer going again, ended up having to remove/re-add it to the computer anyway &lt;/cry&gt;)",Wouldn't be a bad idea...,0
"So, school tech dude here.


I get called up by the athletic director saying that an away team for our upcoming football the next day will have someone there wanting to use our network to live stream the game for fans back home. OK, kind of a pain but I can see what we have to work with. Called the guy up and eventually got in contact with someone from the streaming service, whitelisted a domain on the web filter and ensured a port was open for streaming on the firewall. Good enough right? I went on to also take a picture of the switch in the press box on the football field and I highlighted which ports to use if live streaming (other ports were reserved for other VLANs).


So $angryDude shows up to live stream and he tests it out, works great! Mission accomplished, I'm going to grab my kid and get some groceries, etc.... On the road he calls back and says nothing is working now. Ok great.... can you reboot? He refuses. I ask him to make sure the ports are plugged in correctly or if anything got unplugged on the switch to which he responds ""why would anyone unplug that important looking stuff?"".


So long story short, I drive back to the school and we eventually reboot his streaming encoder and things work. OK good. Going home, again....


After the game.... he unplugs everything including the power strip on his way out and I had to go back in and bring my gear back up the next day. smh

"This happened Friday. I work for internal tech support, so we can only speak to you once we confirm your employee information.

I explain that I would love to assist her, but without being able to find her in the system, we cannot assist her. She thanks us for our time &amp; hangs up.

2 minutes later, call comes in. It's her again, still can't find her in the system. She didn't realize she was speaking to me so she said ""well the last guy couldn't find me either, but I need help.""

"This one happened a long time ago, but I still remember laughing pretty hard about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me = me, EA = boss's Executive Assistant

&amp;#x200B;

I used to provide support for a hedge fund. While the company had some big accounts, the office itself was pretty small (5 people). However, given the amount of money at stake, they couldn't afford to be down for a second, and they ran into plenty of (relatively minor) issues on a daily basis. That's why they needed a full time IT/tech support person.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started there, they had severely outdated machines and equipment. After the fund managers complained enough, I finally convinced the owner (a fight you to the death over a nickel kind of guy) to upgrade the workstations. The fund managers' machines were updated by a certain financial/news/software/data company which may have been started by a now former mayor because we had a contract with that company. The new contract included new(ish) machines for the fund guys. I also installed some extra memory we purchased on our own because 128 MB, seriously? Granted, this was Windows XP, but 128 MB was still just barely the recommended, and they couldn't open more than one Excel sheet while the financial data app was running. A minor purchase to upgrade to 512 MB, and the managers were pleased as could be.

&amp;#x200B;

Along with the new fund managers' machines, we ordered some workstations on the cheap for myself and the EA when the new tech was coming out. Gotta love those clearance sales. This was all done while the boss's EA was on vacation. I had moved over her accounts, files, etc., so she would have a seamless transition when she returned...or so I thought. When she got back, she called me over and started screaming that her oven was missing.

&amp;#x200B;

EA: My oven is gone! Put it back! I need it!

Me: What oven? We don't even have a kitchen in this office.

EA: My oven! The one I use to warm up my lunch!

Me (confused): I don't know what you are talking about.

Then she started pointing at the monitor and shouting, ""MY OVEN! MY OVEN! MY OVEN!""

&amp;#x200B;

I remembered how my cat liked to lay on my old monitor on my computer at home, and it finally dawned on me that she was referring to her old monitor. Along with the new workstations, we got new LCD monitors (as they were finally becoming affordable). She wanted her old CRT monitor back because it generated enough heat that she had been using it to warm up her lunch that she brought from home.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her the old equipment was gone, but she didn't like that answer. She made such a fuss that the boss came out to see what she was screaming about. When I explained the situation, he just rolled his eyes and walked off. He didn't even want to hear it.

&amp;#x200B;

Since there was nothing to be done about her monitor, I just showed her which folder(s) her files were in (as opposed to the file earthquake that she'd had on her previous desktop), and helped her get used to the new OS. However, she continued to give me death stares everyday until a month later when we convinced the boss that a small microwave and coffee maker would benefit the office and make people ""more productive.""","Executive Assistant Says Someone Stole Her ""Oven""",0
"Not sure if this should go here or tales from retail but 

This story is from back in the iPhone 5 days, for some reason SIM cards have always been an enigma for some customers. 

This lady calls my store and complains that she’s having issues with her phone not getting signal, she’s quite agitated and understandably so if she’s not getting the service she paid for. So I run through a few basic troubleshooting steps to start figuring out the issue. I ask her to restart the phone and all that good jazz and check her V****** account to make sure everything is fine there and that she’s not actually past due. (Actually common to get people who haven’t paid their bill for 2-3 months get cut and then complain that they aren’t getting service.... like... what?)  Her account is fine so I ask her to go into field test to give me an accurate signal strength. Everything is fine and then she says something about her SIM card having storage issues or something along those lines. (Customers tend to call SD cards SIMs and vice versa while SIMs only hold your account information now and aren’t used to storage) I inform her as she has an iPhone that there’s no removable storage and that the SIM is only there for accessing the network, she then got another call and we got disconnected. 

She calls back 5 mins or so later from the phone saying it’s working but that something about her sim is popping up on the screen and she doesn’t think she has one. I tell her if she’s using the phone there has to be a sim in the device. She asks where it is and I tell her it’s in the SIM tray on the side, I hear her shuffling her phone and “OH YEA I SEE IT!”..... *Click* 

She removed it while on the phone with me which disconnected our call, and in the process she dropped the sim and couldn’t find it! Just when it all gets good, she then has to come to my store to get a replacement sim and asked to speak to my manager. I inform her I’m the owner and I ask what the issue is. She says it’s my fault she was without a phone because apparently I remotely stole her SIM or something, can’t remember what the exact insanity she was trying to pull was now but basically I comped her a replacement SIM but that wasn’t good enough to her. She finally got that that’s all I could do for her being it was beyond my as well as RedVs™ control and no one else anywhere would be giving her compensation and left. 


Never saw her again but that was quite an interesting day, luckily she didn’t go FULL Karen but she was about a 55% on the KarenScale™","Ma’am, please check your SIM card.... *click*",0
"I'm on the tech support team for a software company.

There's a particular bug in our software that's only affecting a handful of our clients, specifically clients who registered and started using the software before a certain date. And since it's only affecting about ten people, our development team really isn't treating the issue as an ""all hands on deck"" priority. Even though at least three of these people have threatened to cancel service if it isn't fixed soon, because the specific bug is making it so they can't use a pretty critical aspect of the software effectively. Decisions made higher than my pay grade, yada yada.

So I grab a case from the queue, as usual. It's a ranty sort of email from one of the clients who got hit with the bug (we'll call him Jeff). Claiming no one's contacted him in months, he wants a status update, and if it isn't fixed by the end of October, he's cancelling. Some further digging showed that we'd sent him multiple emails about this over the past month or so, but he never replied to any of them. 

Sent a Slack message to one of our supervisors before I respond, he tells me to hold off for a bit while he checks with the devs. Gets back to me within a few hours, gave me the go-ahead to send Jeff the standard ""we're still working on it, we're sorry it's taking so long, we'll get back to you when we can"" response. 

So I do that, with a couple words sprinkled in letting him know what contact info we do have for him, and to let us know ASAP if that contact info is incorrect (some people do have valid email addresses on file that simply haven't been updated in awhile and the emails are going to an inbox the person rarely checks anymore). Also tried to call, but the phone rang straight to a voicemail that hadn't been set up yet. 

I figure, fuck it, one day he'll call in raging and we'll have to tell him he needs to set up his goddamn voicemail like an intelligent human being, and I send off my email. Keep in mind that my reply to his case was sent to the email address he'd sent the case in on. 

With that done, I close the case and peek back into the queue. There's 5 cases all of a sudden from this guy titled ""STOP!!! PLEASE READ!!!"" Um, ok, looks like I hit an autoresponder. I open one up and take a look.

The message is just something along the lines of, ""Don't use this email, use THIS one instead to contact us!"" Which I thought was odd, seeing as the guy used this email address to contact us, but I just kinda shrugged and went to close them all out, thinking it was odd that there were five of them, but I figured that was  the end of it.

I clicked back over to the queue. There were now ten of those ""STOP!!! PLEASE READ!!"" cases. *Okay.* 

The managers have a Slack bot that pings them whenever a new case enters the queue. As soon as I sent off an email to that guy, that bot started going \*nuts\*. The cases were being created almost faster than the bot could keep up with. There would be between 3-5 new cases in the queue every few seconds. We couldn't even GET to our other clients' cases for how quickly these spam cases were being populated. 

We eventually figured out what was happening - basically, this guy had an autoresponder, which we knew. We have a lot of clients who leave their autoresponders on after submitting cases (god knows why), and it does create a new case in our queue. We have your standard ""your case is being reviewed"" autoresponder when a case is submitted. The problem here is that this guy's autoresponder was somehow creating an autoresponding clusterfuck as it communicated with ours that I still don't fully understand, causing cases to just keep getting made and responded to.

The Salesforce team turned off our autoresponder, which stopped the spam so it could be cleared out. I left a Slack message in our channel letting everyone know to please check the email Jeff is emailing in from if he comes back again. 

I don't know what they're going to do going forward, but I'm very tempted to respond to this guy's next ""why haven't I been contacted"" inquiry with ""Your email is cursed. Please advise.""

TL;DR: Client's email address creates an auto-responding feedback loop similar to having Google, Alexa, and Siri all talk to each other at the same time. Chaos ensues.","""Why haven't I been contacted?!"" ""Sir, your email address broke our case queue.""",0
"My first job was at a call center overseas which worked with the biggest prepaid cellphone company in the USA at the time... (2004).
  
I got a call one day and the customer asked me how to top up the phone. I told him to go to a bodega and get a calling card for the specified company and for the amount he wanted.   
  
He lasted about 7 minutes with the clerk and finally told me he had the card. I told him to look in the back for a gray stripe and get a key or a coin and to scratch the stripe and to do it not too soft nor too strong. We struggled for 35 minutes trying to scratch it off to no avail.    
  
Asked the guy to change the card at the store and they did.  
  
After a while I called IT Support and the first thing the guy tells me is: ""did you ask the customer to remove the card from the plastic envelope?""  
  
I came back to the call and asked the customer if indeed had he not removed the card from the plastic cover. The customer remained silent for a couple of seconds and said ""I'm so sorry I'm very stupid"", and hung up.","Please scratch the gray stripe on your card, not too soft to not do anything, not too strong to erase the numbers.",0

She informed me that her HDD was failing and starting to make the amazing click noise we all know and absolutely love. (Sarcasm) 

She asks if we do data recovery and I let her know we do and i ask her if she can bring her drive in sometime to diag; she says she can and that she’ll be in the next day. 

I totally forget by the next day because my brain is amazing like that and she suddenly shows up asking to start a data recovery job. I let her know my techs are free right then and we can start immediately! She’s excited and agrees to the base diag fee (most repairs I offer are no fix no fee but these are time consuming so I charge a base of $35 to cover my techs time), I ask her for the drive and she goes out to her car to grab her bag containing the drive. 

A few moments go by as I’m helping another customer in line before she comes back in, producing a small bag when she gets to my tech bar.

"A story on here just reminded me of a crazy customer I had. 
Was booking in his iPhone 6 for a screen repair and going through the motions. 
I go to create a repair ticket 

Me: so the iPhone 6 screen repair, that will be $x

Him: ok 

Me: now do you have a passcode on the phone? 

Him: ...yes 

Me: *waiting to type it in* what’s the passcode?

Him: why do I have to give you my passcode??

This is pretty typical complaint at this point, some people think we’ll steal their data or bank details or something but I assure him it’s for testing the touch on the screen after we put the new one on. I say sometimes you unfortunately get a faulty screen from the manufacturer (aka the dodgy supplier that the boss constantly gets ripped of by but I didn’t mention that ofc) and we don’t want to send him home with a faulty screen. 
Surprisingly, after a small back and forth he gives me his passcode and I enter it into the repair ticket. 
Now comes the next stage of booking in a repair. Because we have are in possession of a customers device, and for warranty, we need some basic info about them. 

Me: ok sir, almost done, I just need a couple of details then I can print you the repair ticket. What’s your first name? 

Him: *looks at me shocked* why do you need my name???

Me: oh because we have your device we need to keep track of who it belongs to, and also for the 6 month warranty we provide for the repair. All I need is a first and last name and a contact number.

He was suddenly fuming. Yelling about how he didn’t want us to know his name and that we could steal his identity. I assured him that we don’t sell any data to a third party (it’s a tiny business) but then he went on a rant about how our POS system was on the internet and could therefore be H4CK3D! I was trying not to laugh at this and grabbed my manager. 
My manager expertly calmed down the situation, booked in the repair, and our phone tech replaced the screen. 
Story over? Nah.

Guy comes back to pick up his phone and I’m on the front desk again. He says we’ve lied to him and wants to talk to the manager again. Turns out he’s been spending the whole last hour finding and reading through out terms of service (on a different phone, maybe his secret spy burner :o). There’s a section in there that refers to “customer data” - meaning ofc files and such from a device - and a bit where it says that such info must not be kept past the time of the active job and can be deleted on request of the customer (or something along those lines). 

Him: look see! It says here that you’re not allowed to keep my information! 

We explain what the rule is actually referring to and state once again that if he wants a warranty we need to keep his data on the system. 

Him: ok I don’t want a warranty. Delete all my info.

So we complied. There’s no record of him on our system. No record of the repair. Every record him scrubbed clean. Which means if anything goes wrong with his phone - not our problem. We never did the repair. 
The hilarious thing though - through this whole ordeal we had his phone. With his password. Lots more “identity compromising” data on there than a name and phone number. But who cares about some crazy guys data? Not us and not Russian hackers I can assure you. Possibly the police though.",Clearly a secret agent,0
"At a company I worked for more than 20 years ago, I would sometimes get customers who didn’t like what I told them, and demanded to speak to the manager. I’d transfer them, then a minute or two later he’d turn up at my workbench, ask me what the deal was, go back to the phone and tell the customer exactly what I’d told them, only now they’d be happy.

I imagine this is a near-universal experience for people who deal with customers in all sorts of industries, but one of my favourite customer interactions ever went a little differently.

I work as a tech at my local hospital, we have two offices that we work out of depending on what shift we're working (first shift works in the main office, second and third work out of our server room.) Being that it was a Saturday I was the only person in I.T there that day, so my office was completely empty except for me. As I'm doing my normal thing in our main office, like closing tickets and praying no one calls, I hear a ""code red"" get called over the intercom for the floor I'm on. Now, ""code red"" in our hospital means ""there's a fire, one person from each floor grab a fire extinguisher and get to that floor ASAP."" 

Our office takes up about half of the floor, the code red is called on the other side where all of the nurses are. Since there are 10 nurses working at a given time and I'm half a floor over I just ignore it and go back to what I'm doing. A minute or two passes and that ""code red"" gets updated to ""fire alert: Data Center."" At this point my head pops up like a meerkat and I let out a blood curdling ""HOLY SHIT!"" and I'm pretty sure I left a trail of visible light behind me as I cleared an entire floor in the matter of a few seconds. 

This was the case because I know that all nurse managers have a master key that can open up the doors to our server room. Now as I'm sure you are all aware, in a server room fire halon gas is released to suffocate the fire...and these ten people (who are unaware of this) are walking into this directly. 

As I make my way to the hallway where our server room is I see the door shut behind the last person going in. 

I open up the door to hear if the halon sirens are going off...and thankfully they were silent. The halon gas didn't get released and there was no fire in our server room (thank god.)

What happened was that we had a contractor installing rafters above our servers incase the floor above us would flood, the rafters would drain the water away from the servers and save them. What the genious didn't do was clean off the top of the servers. There were chunks of ceiling tile and enough dust to turn the black servers white. Enough dust was kicked up by the moving air to set off a smoke detector and trigger the code red.

Our halon gas gets released when two smoke detctors are triggered. Only one was set off in this major blunder. 

It was at this point when my boss came in that we realized that we don't have any procedures for when we have a server fire. Also what you have to take into account is that these nurses aren't bringing halon fire extinguishers as well, so they wernt doing us any favors by trying to put it out...

So you guys decide, was it one smoke detector that saved 10 people or was it one that could have killed 10 people?",How one smoke detector could have potentially killed 10 people.,0

- _$me_ : He Who Is Cursed By The Last Day Of The Work Week, aka Sensei
- _$boss_ and _$pm_ : top brass managers at _$agency_
- _$kohai(1|2)_ : other devs under Sensei care
- _$queen_ and _$competentBee_ : workers of _$beehiveClient_
- _$beekeepers_ : shareholders of our client, looming threat on the project
- _$hostingProvider_ : _$wizardTechnician_ and _$salesTeam_ managing the machines used by _$beehiveClient_ 

-----

A few months had passed since the last fateful Friday, but I was still working in this project. But this Friday at 5pm no one at _$agency_ was at their desk.

There was a nation-wide sport event and we were enjoying our beers and ciders cheering whatever teams kicked the ball. Some of my colleagues were highly involved and wore the same clothes they had the last time their team won for superstitious reasons, I for one didn't care much but enjoyed the ambiance.

Phone rang and _$pm_ took the hit for us and grabbed the phone. I was about to throw my dart and show to _$kohai1_ that my dexterity was not only keyboard related when _$pm_ handed me the phone.

&gt; _$me_ : Sensei speaking.  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : Hi, I'm sorry but a client called us and said he couldn't order on _$bigEcommerceCmsInstance_, and that they were sure of the credit card they inputted.  
_\*Loud cheer on both side of the phone\*_  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : Yeah I guess you too would be AFK  
&gt; _$me_ : Let me not spill this cider on my computer and I'll double check what you're telling me.  

I put the phone down and launched my IDE and my trusty Firefox and spent 5 minutes checking all the orders on the backend : a few pending payments order, some already canceled and most are successful, nothing suspicious.

True to her nickame, _$competentBee_ already sent me the detail of the client's call with the user email, cart content and choice of shipping/payment method on our ticketing system.

As I'm mirroring the order on my side, _$kohai1_ sits down and asks how he can help us resume our dart game faster. I tell him to grab the ticket and do the same order as I'm doing and stop before payment.

While I'm not finding anything strange in the checkout, I'm grabbing the phone to tell _$competentBee_ that it could just be a fluke of _$user_ just having entered his credit card number wrong. But _$kohai1_ makes a funny face in front of his screen :

&gt; _$kohai1_ : Hey Sensei, are we supposed to enter the card info in the checkout directly? We're not redirected on _$bankUi_? I'm not familiar with _$beehiveClient_.

The unconscious shiver I had when hearing the words *credit card info inputted by $user* now comes full force and I check his screen : in lieu of a simple payment method selection pane with radio button and a Next button, he has a full credit card form asking for number, expiration date and CVV.

We always use payment methods that lets you enter your information on a bank website, never our own website. Even if PCI-DSS is not legally a requirement around here, it's known and most partners will tell you about it. 

Having this form only means one thing : **we've been hacked**.

In the upcoming weeks we'll learn that this is a common hack for our version of _$bigEcommerceCmsInstance_ and we're only one of many infected instances. But at this moment all I could think was the previous GDPR meeting with _$queen_ and the newly appointed bee overseeing Personal Identifying Information passing through all their infra and partners.

&gt; _$me_ : That was all the marketing software, exports and webservices that I know of for all instances of _$bigEcommerce_ and their different states. As said some account exists on each instance so you'll have duplicates on external software and reporting.  
&gt; _$queen_ : Can't we delete them on some instance? Do we need all this information?  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : Most of it is critical to our reporting to _$beekeepers_ and our marketing strategy, we need everything.  
&gt; _$sauronBee_ : We'll still need to give our users a way to delete their own account and information so this can't last.  
&gt; _$me_ : Yeah GDPR compliance is on our backlog, but _$bigEcommerceCms_ was not made with this in mind so it requires some work. Also you have multiple instances in various shade of old.  
&gt; _$sauronBee_ : Legal will have our neck if we're not compliant soon, implementing the cookie banner has not ease their fear one bit.  
&gt; _$queen_ : I'm sorry but marketing needs goes first, I've already told _$agency_ that we need to focus on quick wins for _$beekeepers_ and postpone all risky interventions.  
&gt; _$me_ : Remember that we didn't develop any of your website, nor are we hosting it. For now we're handling technical fixes and design requests to boost your marketing performance, but our audit showed a lot of things needing heavy changes that all can be done but gradually. I assume _$boss_ already told you anything out of that would require The Great Migration, _$queen_?  
&gt; _$queen_ : Yup I've heard but we're good for now, focus on the fixes.

While I already knew it in my heart, this was where I clearly understood that ""We'll do it later"" was the worst sentence a client can utter, for it can mean ""You'll do it for us at the least expected moment"" or ""it won't be done at all"", both equally scary perspective.

When you don't schedule maintenance, maintenance is scheduled for you. And now was the moment I had to look through the dozen patch I recommended installing in our audit.

----

I had to understand what happened first. We quickly found that the hack was javascript related and Chrome-specific, hence me not seeing it. While _$kohai1_ checked every site and found it on every instance, I was looking for the backdoor and suspicious activity.

Luckily I had buggered _$hostingProvider_ to give us access to all logs, and after a few minutes I found many attempts to access a malware script in a public folder.

But logs showed me 404 everywhere. Except I was watching only one of the machine : remember _$queen_ had asked for 2 machines and a load balancer. And sure enough, the second machine had all the attack scripts I saw as 404 previously. And these other logs showed multiple POST done to change some SQL values given the name of the script invoked. Yikes. And of course these posts dated back something like 2 weeks ago, without that call it could have been undetected for even longer. And I had no way of knowing how much SQL tampering had been done.

I replied to our ticket telling _$competentBee_ this seemed a security issue. I spent 20 minutes looking for the front-end exploit so I was expecting her call :

&gt; _$competentBee_ : we've checked on our side, it's everywhere!!  
&gt; _$me_ : Yeah I found their way in but can't find how the fraudulent form is attached.  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : How bad is it?  
&gt; _$me_ : I can't say yet, but it doesn't look good. The credit card skimming might only be the tip of the iceberg.  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : I have to tell Legal before we're sued to hell.  

The word ""lawsuit"" made me realize I wasn't paid enough to handle all of what I handle AND legal implications.

&gt; _$me_ : Listen, I'll brief both _$pm_ and _$boss_ and you do the same with _$queen_ and the highest IT people you can find and we schedule a call at 6.30pm. In the meantime I'll do my best to fix the issue.  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : Ok, call you later.

I have less than an hour to find a fix AND explain everything and what it means for our client and us as a company. There was potential for bankruptcy in my mind so I went after 5 minutes of thinking.

&gt; _$me_ : Some kind of script has been injected somewhere, shows the form for this payment method. A remotely accessible script aka webshell was installed and is now removed, but I don't know how it was uploaded to the server and what has been done/extracted. _$HostingProvider_ certainly could have done a better job and I fail to understand how we could have been bombed by requests and not kick the IP. I don't have a fix yet.  
&gt; _$boss_ : Ok, I've read your audit and the security chapter said some patch had to be installed.  
&gt; _$me_ : Yeah but first on preprod on each instance, then tested, and then deployed on both machine so with a bit of downtime. Why do you ask? I don't know which one could fix the hole in the hull.  
&gt; _$boss_ : What's the easiest one to install? The least risky in terms of breaking the site and block orders?  
&gt; _$me_ (a bit dumbfounded) : ...It won't fix anything...  
&gt; _$boss_ : It'll fix the fact we should have installed them in the first place. And give us breathing room during our talk with _$queen_  
&gt; _$me_ : But we already explained in the audit what it meant and why, and set priorities accordingly...  
&gt; _$boss_ : That's not what I want.  
&gt; _$me_ : Okay... I guess this one in the list do backend stuff so...  
&gt; _$boss_ : Install it right now. And check if the form is linked to the specific payment method, disable it if that's the case, people will use paypal for now.

I gotta give credit to _$boss_ for going 100% the bullshit way, and the intuition on the form being tied to the bank payment method. Disabling it fixed the issue for now, even if the script was still there and might have been collecting the address and phone number in the previous checkout step. I installed the patch so It'd look like we did something.

With only 5 minutes before the dreaded call with the bees, we had a semblance of a solution and blame-shifting facts to throw around in case of accusations. Both _$boss_ and _$pm_ are at the table with me and _$kohai1_ when an angel arrived :

&gt; _$youngDesignIntern_ : Hey Sensei, the table at _$favoriteDrinkingPlace_ is booked at you name right? How much people did you say and what hour? We're going now.

I almost forgot how tactful green people can be, and that we had whoever's victory to celebrate tonight. Coincidence had it was me who planned the whole thing, and nor _$boss_ nor _$pm_ were invited, since I made a point of not being seen as upper management by everyone else since I didn't feel like one given how my input were acted upon, but more on that later. Right now my mind is full of probable lawsuit  but the whole team has been waiting on us for half an hour.

&gt; _$pm_ : Go to your party, we'll handle it from here.  
&gt; _$me_ : You're sure? I'm sure they'll ask how and when it happened.  
&gt; _$boss_ : You'll tell them on Monday. In your opinion, is this solely our fault? Did you personally installed and configure these website?  
&gt; _$me_ : You're right, but I don't think _$queen_ and Legal will see it that way.  
&gt; _$boss_ : Leave them to me.  
&gt; _$pm_: No heads will roll.  

We grabbed our stuff and went to _$goodCocktailPlace_. On the way I was being paranoid with _$kohai1_ and telling him some heads will definitively roll, as they should given the fuck up. But the mood was way more joyful than us gloomy nerds were. I thanked _$youngDesignIntern_ for allowing us to escape, and he told me they all decided he was the least probable person to be fired since he was only with us for a few weeks. Some drinks were on me that night.

On Saturday I hesitated texting _$boss_ to know what was up, but I decided otherwise. Instead I texted my in-law-school best friend to ask what I should do and he had a good idea.

On Sunday morning I sent my resignation letter.

Of course this was merely the big drop that triggered the spill, as this was far from the first time the devs input were sidelined by _$boss_ and _$pm_ and it seemed to get worse over time. The bullshitting also irked me, I wouldn't have wanted to be someone with an account on these website. Given my seniority I still had to stay around __1d6__ months per my contract. But Kanye West really do songs to _quit your job to this_, so my mood was high when I clicked ""Send"" in my Thunderbird. And _$pm_ texted me to confirm he got my email.

------

On Monday I came and went straight to the manager den instead of my desk. 

&gt; _$me_ : You both got my mail? How did it went on Friday evening?  
&gt; _$boss_ : We'll talk about that later. For now focus on fixing what you can and write a beefed up post mortem. Leave _$kohai1_ out of this, I told him to work on something else.  
&gt; _$me_ : Ok, I should have a first draft for you in the afternoon if everything goes well. What should I do if a bee calls or send a ticket?  
&gt; _$pm_ : I'll handle it, you're not available to anyone today.

I grabbed 2 coffee and went to the table I shared with _$kohai1_.

&gt; _$me_ : Americano with sugar for you. What are you working on?  
&gt; _$kohai1_ : Thanks. _$boss_ wants me to see how migration works for _$bigEcommerceCms_ for _$otherClient_. The current instance has been fully patched right? Since you handled it...  
&gt; _$me_ : Take a guess. (*dramatic pause*) Well we don't have ALL the patches, but I know what they would fix and what they would break so it's OK.  
&gt; _$kohai1_ : How do you know that?  
&gt; _$me_ : I read all the changelog and most of the patch diffs. It's a pain to have a patch per issue but at least you can cherry pick and read them quickly. And since I did the hosting environment, I've hardened a bit with some special sauce.  
&gt; _$kohai1_ : Friday was scary. I don't know how we would have handled it without you.  

Was that a subtle way of telling me he was aware of my resignation? It wasn't the first time he shared this sentiment, but it had a different ring now.

----

I impressed him further when I found that one of the script disguised as a Google Analytics script was in fact our attacker script. I must say it was beautifully done : each site a different script on a very convincing domain to handle the various module and custom analytics we had that could have break the malicious script, which precisely targeted our payment method. The script was inserted in the backend with the standard way of inserting custom scripts, and left our own scripts along with the malicious one so I didn't see it on Friday.

_$pm_ had asked _$hostingProvider_ to do a full scan of recently changed files and I found the same result as them : apart from the dropped webshell nothing out of the ordinary was changed, and only one machine of the three had been impacted. Comparing database backups didn't show any config change except the script insertion. I guess the backdoor detection and script insertion was automated, and the hacker was pinged after that to check the script and adjust it at the generated address.

Did that mean we were in the clear? If you didn't talk about 2 weeks of credit card skimming, you could say so. But I still didn't know what _$queen_ and the rest of the bees had to say about that.

I wouldn't have thought my incident report would look so confident but here it was, saying the priority should be made on changing all passwords ASAP, start the patching process and asks _$hostingProvider_ how the webshell deposit and execution was even possible since they were supposed to provide a optimized and secured _$bigEcommerceCms_ instance, and should have blocked the attacker IP from the get go given how many requests were made before attacking.

When I explained everything I found to _$boss_, I didn't expect his answer :

&gt; _$boss_ : Ok, we'll do all that starting tomorrow. The client didn't blame us at all and _$hostingProvider_ explained everything and will fix it ASAP too. All the users will receive an email telling them to pay attention to their bank account for fraudulent transactions.

That was too good to be true, unreal. Exactly, that was not what I heard. The reality was way more depressing :

&gt; _$boss_ : _$queen_ was grilled by the beekeepers since they have read-only access to our ticketing system and someone saw _$competentBee_ ticket. The whole thing was kept under the rug, only _$queen_ and _$competentBee_ are aware of it and the ticket binned. _$HostingProvider_ explained us their hundreds honey a month _Firewall_ is not a _Web Application Firewall_ and only handle network attacks not web requests. Legal was not present during Friday call, nor IT, they were all home given the hour.  
&gt; _$pm_ : Change the passwords but tell them it's just standard procedure since this was not done the first time we changed hosting. Stop all work on the current tickets, from now on we only do marketing and design requests, except urgent and blocking issues.   
&gt; _$boss_ : You'll work on _$newClient_ while we're making our own audit on what E-commerce CMS we'll use for Beehive next. _$Queen_ asked me to check how feasible it would be to merge all instances under the new version of _$bigEcommerceCms_ or another CMS, and I can already tell you we'll be the one doing it and I don't have much room for how much we'll charge for that.

This was madness. I'll leave the morality out of it since shady business happens all the time, but I was glad I had chosen to leave before even hearing what I just heard, otherwise I'd have left the room to reset my ""X day since my inner peace has been nuked"" counter.

&gt; _$me_ : OK I know what you asked _$kohai1_ and I see what you had in mind. But I can already tell you half of what he'll find : doing only a migration we haven't done yet, whatever the chosen solution, will be at least 2 months of work. Add at least 1 month to sort out hosting issues. Add two months to even discuss adding new features and redoing all the custom stuff they already have like the CRM integration. I know you'll want to change design given the opportunity, so _$kohai1_ will also have at least 3 weeks just for that. Oh and on top of that, I don't think merging all these instance will even be possible given the sheer volume of data and duplicates, both in terms of products, categories and customer data. This is a 6 months ordeal even if I don't do it on my own.  
&gt; _$pm_ : We'll make sure you have a _$kohai2_ to support you, but for now we're merely auditing it to give _$beehiveClient_ a quote.  
&gt; _$boss_ : This is what you think but I already did my own analysis for _$otherClientKohai1IsNowWorkingOn_ and I quoted them 1 month for the migration + new design on _$newVersionOfBigCommerceCms_ since it's way less custom than _$beehiveClient_ instances. _$Kohai1_ will do all of it and you'll only oversee hosting changes since _$newVersionOfBigCommerceCms_ is not compatible with our own managed hosting, I already asked _$hostingProvider_ for a quote. We'll discuss your resignation next week since we have meetings all day this week.

The main reason of my resignation was despite my seniority and pompous title, I wasn't much in charge of the tech choices nor the prices we did. But even this was far worse than the usual sh*t. To this day I'm still sure our hosting, done by me despite me not being a sysadmin/devops per se, could have worked with a few tweaks. But that's the only thing I know I could have changed, the rest was already in motion and I could only watch from the shore the Titanic 2 being drawn on paper, despite already having my free ticket with my name in golden letters.

Next time I'll tell you about my final months at _$agency_ and how I fared with __The Great Migration__.

-----

As a post credits scene, _$queen_ left the beehive not soon after. I don't know if my previous feat of Friday miracle helped us regarding _$beekeepers_ ire and if she was disgusted like me or just sacked for the mistake since she chose our priorities and _$hostingProvider_. But not 3 months after that she was working in a local public organization of the same domain and asked us to quote a new corporate website hosted by _$hostingProvider_. Well at least they didn't sell anything online.

"I got an email today from a coworker who's responsible for running the monthly billing cycle.  

There's currently a few improvements going on in their process which means they are looking at the warnings and errors in their process in greater detail. 

In her email she asked me if I could add a cost center to a team where they were getting some warnings from. Well sure no problem. I take a look at the team, and hmm. It already has a cost center... How strange. 

I was pretty busy at the time so I didn't think much about it and just reported back that the cost center had already been filled and went on with my day.

Cue another email a few minutes later: ""But I'm getting this warning. $externalconsultant said the warning was caused because the cost center wasn't filled!""

So I take a second look, the screenshot in her mail showed the error pretty clearly and yeah it said that the error was caused by a missing cost center value.  I take a second look at the config and well everything seems to be in order. To be sure I clear the cost center field and re-enter the data and report back to her: ""Everything's configured properly. Perhaps $consultant overlooked something else. Try running the test again to see if the warning still shows up.""

Now it's near the end of the day, things have wound down and looking for something to do I decide to look at the tests she's done. And well no more error. Why didn't she let me know?

I walk over to her desk and ask her about the error. She cuts me off telling me that $consultant said that the missing cost center causes this error. And she's just going to hope for the best for next month's billing run.

So, she never actually looked at the new results... There's a reason I don't like her that much.",I've tried nothing and it still doesn't work!,0
"Hope this fits here.

A little background.

I used to work for a small IT support company, think everything from printers to full small networks etc. Most of our customers were either engineering firms or small solicitor/accounts type offices.  Nothing really complicated, honest.

So a call comes in from one engineering firm that one of the managers PC's was rebooting almost every evening between 17:30 and 18:00.  So we do the usual from back in the 90's, check for errors, clean and re-seat on all cards etc.  Still no luck, so we put a clone machine in.  This was OK for a couple of day before once again its rebooting almost every evening.

This company was now getting antsy as this PC was used to print out the next days work load and the manager was having to work later to get things ready.  We get them to check the power supply to the offices, no fault found.

So after a couple more visits (we could not stay on site later as the customer would not pay the out of hours charges) my boss asked me to stay and see what the hell was going on as a favour to them.  (they were a pretty good customer, think lots of printers with metal turnings in them etc.

So 17:30 comes round and the manager is working out the next days schedule as i sit there drinking my cup of tea (us English peeps love our cuppas). He is deep in the work when i notice through a small window on the the production floor the guys parking up the electric forklifts.  5 minutes later, boom, PC reboots, manager turns the air blue and basically tells me it has to be the PC and that our company cannot do their job, etc.

I look around and ask if i can pop out onto the production floor, he agrees and we pop through.  I noticed the forklifts were all parked up against the wall to his office, right  opposite the huge charger for them, think 4 forklifts size.

So long story short, it turned out that when the guys flipped the switch to turn on the chargers the EMP burst would knock out his PC, which was of course right up against the wall opposite the charger.

Moved the PC to the other side of the desk and problem solved.

"We have all been there. You are trying to determine the cause of an issue so you ask various questions. Sometimes you get that one answer that just… so basic and technically the truth that you have to just stop and do a double take. “Did they just say that?” You almost feel like you hit a brick wall. 

This is just a small compilation of these tales. 

First one was a session that came in using the remote tool saying her internet doesn’t work. Now the remote tool requires the internet to work, so her internet was working. This one has a double wtf answer that caused me to just stand up and take a woosah moment. 

&gt; $ME – Hello! This is $me with IT. How may I assist?      
&gt; $User – My internet is not working.      
&gt; $Me – Well I see we are connecting on *remote tool* so it appears your internet is working. What are you trying to connect to that is failing?    
&gt; $User – The internet   
&gt; $Me – Riiiiight. What website are you trying to access?  
&gt; $User- The north Dakota housing website.     
&gt; $Me – OK go ahead and try to go there and I will take over. 

She goes there and the site fails to load. I copy paste the URL into my PC and it fails to load for me too. 

&gt; $Me – OK it looks like their website is down.   
&gt; $User – No… I don’t think so it’s a government website.    
&gt; $Me – Yeah that’s par for the course for a state website.   
&gt; $User – No it has to be my internet.     
&gt; $Me – Mam… we are currently connected over the internet.   
&gt; $User – No we are on my wifi.  

I just stared at my screen for a few seconds before I could respond. 

Second one was a printer issue that was not a printer issue. Ill explain. Guy was having issues with printer printing random numbers of copies of everything he printed. 

&gt; $Me  -  Thank you for calling IT this is $Me.     
&gt; $User – Hi this is $User. My printer is on the fritz again.   
&gt; $Me – OK what is it doing?  
&gt; User – When  I go to print is prints random numbers of copies.  
&gt; $me – How so? Like what do you mean by random numbers?  
&gt; $User – well first it printed 2 copies, then 7, and then tried to print 43.    
&gt; $Me – Yeah… that’s definitely random numbers… Where are you trying to print from?    
&gt; $User – My computer. 

I had to take a second for that to click and mute my mic to keep from saying “Uhhh dahoy.” Issue was he spilled coffee on the numpad part of his keyboard and it was firing off. 

Call comes in from a girl about her passwords not working. 

&gt; $Me – Thanks for calling this is $ME.    
&gt; $User – Hello My passwords are not working.     
&gt; $ME – OK are you getting an error message when you log in or does it say invalid username or pass?   
&gt; $User – Invalid  
&gt; $Me – OK, what are you trying to log into?    
&gt; $User – Everything. 
 
(Deep sigh) I had to stare at that one for a bit. I took her to the password self service site and got her password reset. Then I clocked out and walk to my car in a daze of pure stupidity.

EDIT: Later we had a call come in that was transferred to me. 

&gt; $Me - Hello this is $Me with IT how may I assist?  
&gt; $User - I need to report that our office is off wifi and on the internet.  
&gt; $me - *Freezes for a second as I make a derp face* Ooookay thanks for reporting it.

"Phone call came in from a customer this morning - they had blown out the fusing on their multi-board (read: power-strip or power-board for those international readers), and wanted a tech to test and see what caused it to pop. It's the one their computer was plugged into, so they wanted me to check that it hadn't caused any problems there either.I got to site, and asked what they'd been doing when it popped. They wouldn't answer directly what they had been using to blow the old board, but when they'd been on the phone I'd told them to leave everything plugged in so I could trace it properly.Computer, monitor, speakers... and a power brick. 18V, 3A. I can't see what this is for, so I trace the cord - into a drawer next to the desk.It's for a vibrator. A wall-powered,  impressively torquey vibrator.

I ended up having to go with an industrial surge board, because ye Gods. That's a lot of power for a DC motor, and those are not gentle when you initially start them.

I almost wish I'd thought to grab the model of the vibe when I tested it with the multimeter, because that motor would have been powerful enough for an RC car.  I pity whatever poor person tries to please that woman if she needs that amount of power for it.

The computer was fine, too. It just froze when the inrush power was requested.

[Part 2: Securely Unable to Access](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/dcj6th/securely_unable_to_access/)
_________________
At $OldFirm, stupidity wasn't in short supply especially on my team. We had a few people who were good, but most of the rest tended to be lazy and/or dumb. Especially $OldBoss, who just had a knack for signing us up for work that just doesn't make a lot of sense or required us to split up a project amongst several of us. Here's how me improving that process went:

&gt; $Me: Can we start using JIRA?

&gt; $OldBoss: I don't want to use JIRA.

It wasn't because we were not using it inside $OldFirm, because we were on the main development team. Anyhow, a statement of work comes in for $GovAgency for a Caribbean nation. A statement of work had two parts:

1. A description of what we were to do.
2. Lots of legalese formalizing the payment amount and CYA.

What we were to do usually only took up a few lines on the first page. This particular one had only one sentence:

    Move things from A into B based on information in C.

That's not even redacted folks, except for a specific word to describe what A, B, and C were that we used there. Basically I was to develop a plugin that would automatically do this for them, and in the process I had a few questions. Namely B didn't have all the same fields that A had, but $Random did, and I brought this up to $OldBoss during development:

&gt; $Me: Are we sure they want this data to go into B? I think $Random is a much better fit.

&gt; $OldBoss: No, I'm pretty sure they want the data to go into B.

...and then the words that came out of his mouth next made me go home that night and begin my job search:

&gt; $OldBoss: Besides, if it breaks and they come back we can always \*makes gesture for mo' money\*.

&gt; $Me: \*Hello jaw, meet floor.\*

That ended up causing me to do exactly what I said.
___________

Oh, the JIRA dangling thread from earlier:

I had gotten the job I had applied for several weeks before, and found out that HR and my boss were awfully chummy and found out quickly about the background check. I then proceeded to get gaslighted about how they were thinking about giving me a raise and moving me to the main development team when a position opened up. Seeing as I had put up with 8 months of a lot of stupid, and the fact that a position wouldn't have opened up for at least 4 years I took that as I would never have moved up the ladder. That and there were only three steps I could've taken anyways.

I decided to (kinda) give them one last chance (not really):

&gt; $Me: So, why do you not want to use JIRA?

&gt; $OldBoss: I just don't have access to start that process.

Doubt that.

&gt; $OldBoss: If that's a big sticking point, I'm willing to start using that if it will make your job easier.

Doubted that too. I knew he liked to run things the way he was running them because he held control, and I learned what true gaslighting was. In the end, I'm way happier than I would've been at that job and I'm making 36% more too.

End credits scene:

Between changing jobs, I like to take a week and relax. This particular week I went back home to western Nebraska, where I'm from, and spend it with family. On that weekend of that trip, I took my 8-year-old brother down to Denver to the Aquarium and the Museum there. Didn't make it to Casa Bonita though, but it's not too big of a loss. Been there before.

So we're driving to Denver and $OldBoss messages me through my website and then through my photography Facebook page two minutes later. Odd, since he should have my phone number after eight months and annoying because I don't like to drive distracted. At some point, I eventually cool off enough to call him:

&gt; $Me: What did you need?

&gt; $OldBoss: Where did you put all your stuff at in Bitbucket?

Gee, did you ask the developers to go through the commit logs before asking me? Of course you didn't, because you don't like them because they like to be organized to a degree.

&gt; $Me: They're in \*redacted because I don't remember and I don't care\*.

&gt; $OldBoss: Cool. Thanks.

Haven't heard from him since, and I'm thankful for that. I don't think I could've learned a lot more from that place anyways.

"Realtors are a special breed of users. This Realtor, let's call her Betty, came in today to talk about web stuff and starting a team business. First it was normal business talk but then she starts crying because she can't see any emails. I get her calmed down and start looking into it.

I found out She was logged into her company email. Sounds normal, but let me give you a quick background. We switched to Gsuite 2 years ago. I sent instructions for logging into the company email multiple times... She never followed them so I just forwarded her email for her since she uses a personal gmail account for business. See the problem? How this woman managed to login to the company email after 2 years of not logging in is beyond me. So, we login to her personal gmail account and there it all is.

Next up, the website. She has been printing and promoting her website: bettysellsstatename.com.  I asked her some questions about her domain. She answers them and then She says, ""you know, I don't even know what the website looks like."" ... Okay, we'll that's probably not a good sign.

I go to the website annnd: ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED. 

Yeah, she doesn't own the domain. So we go to Godaddy to purchase the domain. Credit card expired. 

I would say just forget it and use our branding but She can't just re-brand herself, that domain name has been printed all over her marketing material for years. She needs to own that domain. I then say, ""Go home, find the new credit card, and purchase the domain. Then give me the login info so I can set the forwarding up for you.""

I won't let her touch the DNS settings for obvious reasons.. You know what though, even though she has epically failed at technology, she has 11 deals going through at the same time. That's no small task so I'll chalk this up to her brain bring extra stressed with all the deals.",I don't even know what my website looks like.,0
"I had a crazy thing happen to me today.

I have a coworker that we'll call John AKA Jake Smith. Seems like older people call him one name and younger people call him the other. This is a small town place and he grew up here and he's an older guy and I assume the people that knew him when he was young are the ones calling him by a nickname. Whatever.

John caught me last week to complain about his printer. He works out in the corner of the production floor I rarely visit. I walk out there when I find some time today and spend 15-20 minutes cleaning welding schmoo off rollers and giving the printer a general once over. While I work I ask him about current events, the weather, his grandkids, compliment his new flat top haircut he says reminds him of his time in the marines. Regular talk.

He asks if I fixed his email problem. I didn't know he had one. Turns out that's what he thought I was out there to fix and he didn't think the printer was really that big of a deal. He says he emailed somebody about the Outlook problem. Weird. So I check it out and his .ost file is full, just need to set him to not download all the shared mailboxes he's on. Fixed. That's why I didn't get his email telling me he wasn't getting any emails.

Head back. Get to the edge of the production floor and I hear, ""Get the printer fixed?"" Turn around and here's John F#@&amp;ING Smith, with the same F#@&amp;ING haircut he had LAST WEEK, no flat top. John F#@&amp;ING Smith has a F#@&amp;ING TWIN. I've worked here for almost 2 years and have had several conversations with this person. Apparently one is the supervisor and one is the lead man on a line that runs quietly in the back of the plant. They basically split the paperwork sharing the same jsmith email and domain account. I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS.

At this point I wish I would have fixed the email and not the printer, then missed long hair jsmith on the way off the floor so I could have gotten the full twin hijinks experience.

"Bit a different type of tech support to the usual, but I thought you guys might enjoy this story from a few years back.

I work as a lab technician in a school. The job is basically to assist science teachers - we mix the chemicals and set up all the technical equipment that they need for lessons. It's a very easy job that any organised person with common sense can do, but good or bad techs can make or break lessons - having trained as a teacher myself I've suffered on the other side of this relationship too.

*Most* science teachers respect decent techs. However, there's always some - almost invariably young trainees - who think that because I'm doing a manual job I don't know as much as them with their shiny new degrees. Incidentally, I have a Masters in mathematical biology, have worked in research labs overseas and often understand the science of their lessons better than they do. But I don't tend to advertise that, because I'm not (usually) a dick, so people make their assumptions.

Enter one such trainee, James. He was actually a nice enough guy, but a bit clueless - in one unrelated incident, he left his wallet in a taxi and blamed the driver for 'driving off with it'. But I digress.

James wanted to do an experiment showing how red, green and blue light mix to make white. Cool. James wanted light boxes plus red, green and blue acetate filters, so the students could create coloured beams and combine them to make white light. A bit tricky to get this working in practice, but okay. James wanted to put all three coloured filters in front of the *same* light box, to show that doing so results in white light shining through them... wait, what? You don't need James' mechanical engineering degree to understand that this wasn't going to work.

Now, technically, I'm only required to put out the equipment that the teacher requests, no questions asked. But because getting up in front of a class of teenagers is scary when you're not used to it, I always go out of my way to be helpful to trainees. I figured James had simply derped while planning, and that once I explained what was wrong with his setup he'd immediately understand the issue.

You guys who've been in tech support longer than I had all know where this is going.

I pointed out that filters only let light from a narrow band of wavelengths (i.e. one colour) pass through them, and that if you stack different coloured filters, any light that gets through one filter will be absorbed by another. This is not only a *really* basic physics concept, but one that he was supposed to be explaining to his eighth grade students in about an hour's time. He stared at me blankly.

I thought maybe I wasn't doing a great job of explaining the issue in words, so I said 'Look, I'll show you'. I took him to my office, set up a light box and put three different coloured filters in front of it. (This was all taking place during my lunch break, mind.) Then I explained the problem again, this time with reference to the physical example right there in front of him.

His response? 'Oh, well, I've definitely seen the experiment done this way before. It must be that your equipment's not good enough. Just put it out how I asked you to, I'll make it work.'

Well, at this point I decided I'd given him more than enough help. So I smiled, agreed, and set the equipment out exactly as he'd requested. Then I told my boss, who also happened to be the teacher who was grading James' lesson, what had happened. We passed an entertaining half hour sitting in my office next to the classroom, listening to him flounder as he tried to lead 30+ increasingly bored, then hostile 14-year-olds through an unsuccessful experiment and completely failed to understand why it wasn't working.

My boss had zero tolerance for bullshit, found my approach to the situation highly amusing, and would bring up that story from time to time until I left. Best manager ever - still miss that guy.

Tl;dr: trainee teacher fought the Beer-Lambert Law, and the law won.","What does 'filter' even mean, anyway?",0

"This happened yesterday and this morning. I do IT support and IT training for a company and have for three years. They are bringing a new girl to become they're in-house tech because my contract with them has ended. Basically I am supposed to train this girl on *my job.* I'm willing do that because I barely want this contract anymore and really don't care for it because of the crap I've had to put up with to retain it. This type of thing happens with this client *all the time*. I've been in this business for ten years and my complaints can be counted on one hand, and we have over seventy Google reviews, all 4 and 5-star ratings, many of them mentioning me by name. Then this client comes along. This was just kind of the last straw after three years.

&gt;**WED 12:23 PM**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q:** Hey **Mr. X,** we're having some internet troubles here at the office, so I'm postponing with **\[NEW EMPLOYEE\]** until it's back up and running. I'm going to call her and go over what I can over the phone that doesn't require me to remote in or to show her anything  
&gt;  
&gt;**WED 1:31 PM**  
&gt;  
&gt;**X:** Will she be ready and through the training in the next hour and a half?  
&gt;  
&gt;**X:** **Q**, I have to say I'm a little annoyed. **\[NEW EMPLOYEE\]** reports that you had another client during her training time, then you had network issues and were going to call her back, then never called her back. So now she's not trained for our meeting today so now my time is going to be wasted.  
&gt;  
&gt;**WED 3:46 PM**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q:** I did have a client this morning and when it started to run long I let her know that it was running long and I would be a little delayed. I come into the office and **\[NET PROVIDER\]** is working on the lines right now which pretty much eliminates anything involving remote work. I had asked her for her phone number so that way I could call her Direct, but **\[NET PROVIDER\]** who is also my cell phone company, wasn't allowing access to 4G and I did not get the phone number until right about an hour ago. I'm very sorry that this happened, but understand all of it was out of my control  
&gt;  
&gt;**X:** A word of advice in business, **Q**: nobody really cares about excuses. I hear your story but it doesn't affect anything from my end. What I see here is that your meeting ran long and there were some tech issues. In no other work environment other than mine would that be acceptable in any way shape or form. I could ask why you didn't go to a Starbucks. Or call from a landline. Or use your home internet. I never could have built my business if I had let little things like this get in the way of my ability to deliver results. You shouldn't either.

*Note:* He straight up asks why I can't ***go to Starbucks or go home***. I don't know, maybe because I have, like, a job? And our landline is a VOIP by the way as many are. Not to mention, my home net and the Starbucks here use the same provider we do...and they were out. The nearest Starbucks that doesn't use our provider is 45 minutes from the office. Yes, I'm in a small town.

&gt;**TODAY 9:21 AM**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q:** To update you on yesterday, **\[NET PROVIDER\]** experienced an attack. They had to shut down many their connections they deemed relevant. I assume since we bounce internationally on a VPN, we were deemed relevant. I just checked it at the office this morning it's back up and running

"Names have been changed to protect the innocent.  But not the guilty.

There was a young, motivated, and inexperienced computer engineer working at a small company that built inspection machines for a niche market.  These inspection machines consisted of WinTel computers along with some specialized hardware for interfacing with the inspection sensors and general control, enclosed in a nice air-conditioned cabinet for all the electrically-bits.  The software was developed in-house as well and ran on top of Windows.  If you ever worked in manufacturing before, you've probably run across this kind of setup before.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this company built the computers in house from off-the-shelf parts.  Intel CPUs, Samsung SSDs, Crucial RAM, Supermicro mobos, you get the drift.  Each developer got an exact copy of the currently shipping hardware and machine components, so it would be easy to develop and test locally.  The hardware was always on the mid-to-high end, so this worked out well for everyone.  There was a sole IT professional that handled the company's IT needs (obviously) and did the purchasing and inventory for the WinTel components.

&amp;#x200B;

The antagonist of our story (mentioned above) was a fresh college graduate with a degree in Computer Engineering with a focus on embedded systems.  So when a small project came up for a small embedded peripheral to this peripheral, the CpE volunteered to take it, and management approved.

&amp;#x200B;

On to the story.  Characters:

CpE: Smart, yet inexperienced engineer.  Antagonist.

IT: Information Technologist of the House Support, 30 Million of His Name, King of the Servers, the rightful Admin of all PCs and protector of the databases, King of Active Directory and Khal of the network.

&amp;#x200B;

Scene: IT's office.

&lt;knock knock&gt;

IT looks up to see CpE standing meekishly in the doorway, looking as guilty as a young puppy who peed on the carpet after house training.

CpE: ""I...need to pull a new motherboard, keyboard, and USB hub from stock.  I'm not sure if... I'm going to need more components.""

IT: ""...Okay.  We have the parts in stock, but what's this about?  Usually stock pulls are for complete machines.  Is there something wrong with a machine on the shop floor?""

CpE: ""Nothing wrong with production as far as I know.  I...just...ummm....well....it's....""

&amp;#x200B;

The CpE is staring at his shoes and moving in a clearly uncomfortable fashion.  Something is clearly wrong and all evidence points to CpE as the guilty party.

&amp;#x200B;

IT: ""Sit down and tell me what happened.""

CpE: ""I...I... blew up my computer..."" &lt;sniff&gt;

IT: "" ... wat?""

CpE: &lt;tears welling up&gt; ""I blew up my computer.  I didn't mean to.  I was working on the new embedded peripheral prototype...and....and....""

IT: ""go on...""

CpE: ""I was rearranging the hardware on my desk when I heard this loud 'POP'.  I looked up at my monitors and they were all black.  I heard all the fans running at 100% and there was smoke pouring out of my keyboard and computer case.""

IT: ""ummm...""

CpE: ""I cut power to everything.  The embedded peripheral, PC, monitors, everything in my cubicle.  I tried bringing my PC back up, but nothing happened when I pressed the power button.  I opened up the side of the case and there was black charring around the USB ports on the motherboard.""

IT: ""So what happened?""

CpE: ""I think I put 24V on the 5V USB rail by accident"".

IT: ""...""

CpE: ""..."" &lt;sniff&gt;

IT: ""How?""

CpE: ""I &lt;siff&gt; left some wires hanging loose off the prototype and must have bumped them.  I had a USB adapter &lt;sniff&gt; that I was using to communicate with the prototype and the loose wires touched something they shouldn't have. &lt;sniff&gt;  The main power supply on the prototype is 24V and one of the loose wires was on the 24V supply.  It touched the 5V USB rail on the USB adapter""

IT: ""...""

CpE: ""...""

IT: ""...""

CpE: ""... am I going to get fired? ...""

IT: ""How much equipment, in dollars, do you think you destroyed?""

CpE: ""....ummm....""

IT: ""Answer honestly.""

CpE: ""...$500...."" &lt;sniff. grabs a tissue from the box on IT's desk&gt;

IT: ""$500. Mkay.  Assuming *everything* company owned in your cubicle got fried, that's probably, what? 3 grand worth of equipment, right?""

CpE: &lt;gasp.  starts sobbing&gt;

IT: ""Wait.  I haven't finished""

CpE: &lt;looks up in horror&gt;

IT: ""Have you ever brought an embedded control system to market before?""

CpE: &lt;slowly shakes head no&gt;

IT: ""This was a prototype you were working on?""

CpE: &lt;nods yes&gt;

IT: ""Something went wrong and the magic white smoke came out?""

CpE: &lt;nods yes&gt;

IT: ""Remind me again: What went wrong?""

CpE: ""I &lt;sniff&gt; left some &lt;sniff&gt; power wires loose &lt;sniff&gt; and they &lt;sniff&gt; touched the adapter!!!!""

IT: ""I see.  You left some wires loose, they got bumped, and some electronics got destroyed.""

CpE: &lt;sniff&gt; ""yes"" &lt;sniff&gt;

IT: ""Grab another tissue.  Here's what's going to happen.  I'm going to pull the components to another complete system for you from stock.  You're going to go back to your cubicle and rebuild your PC.  I know you can handle this since your built your PC on your 1st day here.  You're going to return all of the old components to me for proper disposal.  Keep the original SSD if it still works.  No point in reinstalling the OS since the replacement hardware is identical and the SSD probably survived.  You're probably going to be back up and running in an hour.""

CpE: &lt;puzzled look&gt;

IT: ""What did you learn?""

CpE: &lt;even more puzzled look&gt;

IT: ""It's not a trick question.  What did you learn?""

CpE: ""Never leave wires flying in the breeze?"" 

IT: ""Bingo.  5, 10, 20 years from now, you will never make this mistake again.  This company just spent, at most, 3 grand training you.  I don't know what you make salary wise, but my guess is the equipment you destroyed, worst case, is the equivalent of 5 days of what this company spends on you.  It probably cost over $20,000 to hire you, considering the recruiter fees, HR time, interview time, and so on.  

&amp;#x200B;

You did something that cost the company a pittance compared to what it took to hire your, never mind your salary and benefit cost.  You obviously know what you did wrong, and you'll never make this mistake again.  If the company fired you over this, they'd be spending another $20 grand minimum to replace you.  Shit happens.  It's happened to me, it's happened to you, it happens to everyone.  You're young.  You're inexperienced.  College should teach you how to learn, and you've learned from this.

&amp;#x200B;

Now take these parts, rebuild your PC, and let me know if you need anything else.""

CpE: ""Tha.... Thank you""

IT: ""This isn't the first time I've dealt with with destroyed parts and this won't be the last.  Just don't leave wires loose again.""

CpE: ""Absolutely""

"In 1984 I was an enterprising young geek, all of 16. At the time I had been the first kid in my school to own their own computer - a Commodore VIC 20 - and I was well on the way to my current career in computing.

One sunny day I got on my bicycle and peddled from Leiden where I lived, about 40 km up the road to Amsterdam where the action was.

Being a geek, action consisted of a travelling high technology roadshow put together by IBM. It showcased the latest and greatest in information technology.

Word spread quickly around the hall that I was the crazy kid who cycled 40 km to come and see the roadshow. Being so very excited and interested opened doors that otherwise might not have, had things been different.

Two displays made a lifetime impression.

One of the demonstrated technologies was a voice recognition system. The presenter had a cold and the software was having trouble, even though she had spent several hours retraining it. As a joke, I repeated the command and it recognised and then proceeded to respond to my instructions. Lots of fun to play with. 

The most memorable technology was a large high resolution display with a highly detailed wireframe model of the Space Shuttle. Picture a Shuttle, mounted to the external tank and two solid rocket boosters. It wasn't quite to the level of individual components, but it was the most detailed model I'd ever seen, then and since.

Next to the display was a board with eight knobs that you could turn to make the wireframe turn in realtime. One knob for roll, one for yaw, one for pitch and one for zoom.

The thing about these knobs was that they were very smooth to operate. So much so that you could flick them and like a top they'd keep spinning and the wireframe Space Shuttle would also keep spinning. The spinning knobs were so smooth that you had time to spin more than one simultaneously and the model would spin accordingly.

After playing with that for a bit I sidled up to the person managing the display and said: ""That's really cool, but that's not the computer. Can you show me the computer that's actually doing the work?""

A grin appeared and in hushed tones I was shown to the back of the hall, following thick bundles of cable, through the back door outside.

There were two semi-trailers parked next to the hall. Picture two purpose built eighteen wheelers, white, not unlike large refrigerated food trucks.

The attendant pointed at one and said: ""That's the power supply ..."", then pointed at the other: ""... and that's the computer that spins the Shuttle.""

"I've been wanting to share this story for a while now, but have been busy so I never got around to it.

So, we got this statement of work in for this one client who is huge in the medical industry (like, almost only the players bigger are state and federal governments huge) and they seem to be having an issue with one of the plugins we wrote for them years ago. They have a Java servlet (important) that calls our plugin via SOAP (ASMX Web Service, we're a .NET shop) and ever since we upgraded them the plugin doesn't seem to work. Alas, as the developer on the team that is to handle this, I get it in my lap.

Naturally, I did a diff on the ASMX they had running (they had the cloud version, not too difficult to obtain) and what we had in our application as we had integrated this plugin some odd years back into the main codebase. Of course, the diff doesn't tell me much other than there's nothing wrong with our code, but we ""have to fix it"" according to $ProjectManager. So, I do a code review of their servlet that is calling the ASMX Web service and don't see anything that could magically cause 0 results to be returned. I did see anti-patterns galore, but that's another story. Anyhow, this isn't /r/programminghorror, so back to the story.

So, eventually I check their setup and lo behold, they were searching on the wrong field to get the data they want back. Might have gotten changed during the upgrade, but these are lazy developers from Kerbleckistan so of course they didn't bother checking if they were searching the right field or not. Let them know what to do and sent them on their merry way, thinking I would never have to deal with them again. Boy, was I wrong.

&gt; $Client: We are now getting this error "" javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: \*I forget the rest.\*"".

So before this had happened, our server administration team had upgraded the SSL certificate on our servers before our current cert expired (like any decent admins would). Little did we know that $Client would have problems caused by this. So I do all sorts of roundabout things like having them import the SSL cert into the keystore that I had to prepare for them (instructions, the cert, the works) because for some odd reason (used to be a Java developer, am now again) I knew more about this than they did (actual Java developers at the time). Well, I have tried just about all I can think of to figure out what they need to do to fix the problem.

&gt; $OldBoss: We have got to get this fixed for them! Do all you can! I have faith in you!

Yeah, after a few private encounters with him I doubted that, but moving on. I actually get this idea to write a simple Java app and test it with several Java versions:

1. Java 8: Nope, can connect just fine.
2. Java 7: Nope, can connect just fine.
3. Java 6: Huh, handshake failure just like $Client. Bingo.

So I ask the client what version of Java they're using, and they respond with (quelle grand suprise): Java 6. F$CK! Apparently Java 6 doesn't support the new SSL algorithm we use, because it's 12 YEARS OLD BY THIS POINT! Also, Oracle was one month out from dropping paid support for Java 6 too soooo....

&gt; $Client: What do we do to fix this?
&gt; $Me: Upgrade your Java runtime to at least 7, but I recommend 8 as you will have support for longer.

Apparently, someone over there didn't like that response:

&gt; $ClientBoss: Listen, we're losing money every day because our system isn't working because it cannot send and fetch data from $DocManager! You need to do something about this NOW!

So, relevant: $DocManager has resellers that package it with other software to automate workplace stuff, and normally they will throw us under the bus whenever possible. Not today:

&gt; $Reseller: They have given you a perfectly adequate solution. It is up to you, not them, to apply it to your systems and to get them working.

And with that, I never had to deal with that client again. Still owe $Reseller a beer for his response. Said what I wanted to, and I didn't have to deal with the repercussions for it.

I think about the stories like that, and I'm glad I left.

"First post, be gentle, common courtesy, yadda yadda yadda... Also, long - sorry. 

So, I‘m a teacher at a secondary school which is fairly advanced in regard to IT-equipment: All classrooms are equipped with LAN, Smartboards (digital whiteboards with interactive projectors), a Windows-PC and an Apple-TV - it‘s a compromise to get each and every teacher the tools they (think they) need in the digital age. Additionally, there is campus wide wifi, which works well most days, and occasionally not at all. The whole system has a server at the center that runs a proprietary variant of Debian Linux including DHCP for the whole network.

For reasons that have become hazy over the past couple of years I have become the go-to tech guy for most of the teachers - I‘m sort of self taught, have always been interested in the stuff, and even though there should be some sort of professional IT-support, due to lack of funding... there isn‘t. So when the system has a hiccup, I‘m the guy they call for help. I‘m not IT, and my lack of knowledge especially in regard to networks should be apparent from this text. I‘m the prototypical one-eyed king among the blind. Believe me, that‘s not a good feeling.

This happened this morning.

I‘m about to start my lesson, but can‘t log in on the PC in my room. I should be able to log in with my Windows domain account, but after the login-prompt nothing really happens. I notice that the access point in the room has a red blinking light, which means it can‘t connect to the internet and do it‘s job. I try to reach the webfacing interface for our server on my iPad, which is connected to the school‘s wifi, but get a „you are not connected to the internet“-warning. My students - all equipped with iPads, report the same. 

A knock on the door, a student from another class enters the room:

student: „Ahem, Mr. JoeDoe23, could you come to room so-and-so, Mrs. Teacher1 can‘t log in to the PC in order to use the smartboard...?“

me: „with you in a minute, tell her I‘ll be down soon.“

OK, seems to affect more than just my room... I turn off the wifi on my iPad and try to reach the server via data - which to my surprise works. I can log in, everything‘s dandy. I tell my students to stay put and head to the server. Log in as root, run a chk - everything appears to be fine. I head over to another room, but am interrupted by another student that is looking for me:

student2: „Mr. JoeDoe23, Mr. Teacher2 told me to get you, nothing‘s working...“

me: „I‘m on it, tell him to wait it out, it seems to be a bigger problem...“

In the teachers lounge I try to log into another computer - no go. Back to the server, restart the whole thing. (I told you I‘m no IT-guy, I‘m just „the guy“... it‘s not like I really know what to do... but I can restart the thing - whatever the thing is - and know that 85% of the time that‘ll do the trick!) No change. Alright, time to do the dreadful thing and call the company that does the real support for the server. (It‘s dreadful because I am in the terrible situation that my colleagues perceive me as a IT-god because I‘m always fixing their stuff, but „real“ IT-folks look down on me, because I‘m just an imposter that breaks their stuff... enter relevant xkcd or other webcomic in the comments!)

me: „Yeah, uh, hi there, it‘s Mr. JoeDoe23, we‘re having some trouble with out network today, and since your server is doing the DHCP-thing I was wondering if you could remote in an have a look of sorts...?“

very friendly support guy (they‘re not so friendly most of the time, so I felt the need to add this info here): „Let me see... the server is running fine... but I can see that the DHCP-queue is clogged up to the max (my words, not his!). It appears you have some sort of loop in the network.“

me: „what do you mean, loop? As in, someone has shorted a switch with a patch cable somewhere on the premises?“

very friendly support guy: „yup, sounds about right.“

me: „so what do I do? check each and every room’s sLAN-outlet (is that even the right term?) and switch for an incorrectly plugged-in cable?“

very friendly support guy: „that‘s exactly the only thing you can do... good luck.“ [hangs up]

(I dramatized here - of course he didn‘t hang up on me, he‘s a professional... we said our good byes and I hung up first.)

Alright, back to my class, tell the students to keep chillin‘ - which they happily obliged... „no worries, Mr. JoeDoe23 - do your thing, we‘re good here!“ And off to check each and every classroom, looking for the loop. 
In every room, the same situation: teachers improvising, because they can‘t access their stuff since they can‘t log in:

Teachers3, 4, n: „Hey, good you‘re here - the system‘s down, what‘s going on?“

me: „don‘t know, I‘m on it, checking every room, loop somewhere...“

After 24 rooms... no dice. Another teacher bumps into me in the hallway:

Teacher25: „JoeDoe23, what‘s going on, wifi‘s out, I can‘t login...?!?“

me: „server-support says there‘s a loop in the LAN somewhere, I‘m checking every classroom... hope I can find it soon.“

Two rooms later, still no loop, Teacher25 comes in:

Teacher25: „I think I found it! Come with me...!“

Now I‘m intrigued - so far, the whole ordeal has cost me about an hour, my lesson for this morning has gone to shit, but maybe we can salvage the rest of the day.  Teacher25 takes me to his room, which until recently was a computer and still has the LAN-outlets (again, that word?) on the walls. He‘s pointing at a student, who is not looking very happy. 

Teacher25: „So I said to my students upon returning from our short conversation just minutes ago: It‘s still down, Mr. JoeDoe23 is looking for some sort of loop in the network, no idea really what that means... when young Mr. Student over here points to the LAN-outlet behind him and says: Like that?“

Turns out: It was raining this morning, and Mr. Student had his umbrella with him... and upon entering the classroom, he was looking for a place to put it... and he noticed a short patch-cable dangling from a LAN-outlet (sorry!)... so he took the loose end, plugged it in the second channel in order to have a place to hang his umbrella! And he brought down the whole network, and with it the whole school...!

Unplugged the cable, and I could hear and feel a resounding breath of relief throughout the whole campus, as teachers and students were suddenly able to log in, warning-lights on access-points switched back to white... and we were back online.

TL;DR: Student created a loop with a patch cable to hang his umbrella, brought down the whole network.",umbrella brought the wifi down,0
"I was a Custodian at a good sized School District and had slowly worked my way onto the day shift as an Assistant Supervisor.

I was tech savy and people would generally ask me to help them with computers (except macs, never owned one).  I had a good working knowledge of audio/visual as well, so I was tasked with setting up the technology for most of the meetings/gatherings etc.

Every single classroom had these 20 year old CRT televisions that were mounted to the wall.  They were ""industrial or institution"" models.  All they had on the back were BNC connectors (labeled Video/yellow r/Red L/White) and a RF input.  (Most people know that BNC is just a RCA jack that is designed to lock into place to be tamper proof)
These TVs had like 10 video inputs which were for security cameras. 

They had bought all these new DVD players and wanted to connect them.  So the ""official Tech/AV guy"" got a plan approved to buy RF converters (Basically turns the RCA Output of the DVD into a signal on the coax Channel 3 or 4).  Now with 80 TV's that runs into some money!

Each RF converter (I don't know where they ordered them) cost them $15!

When The order was delivered on the dock I went directly to the Principal and got the info.  I informed her that we could buy RCA to BNC adapters for $.50 each (so each TV would cost $1.50).

So AV guys plan = 80\*15= $1200

My plan = 80\*1.50 = $120

The AV Guy refused to even consider that it would work -- Swore up and down that BNC was a nonstandard format and was useless for this.  I asked the Principal to not open the converters for a day.

I drove to Radio Shack (I'm old, Huh LOL) and bought 3 BNC-RCA adapters.  ($3)

The next day I pulled the principal vice principal into a classroom and had them watch me hook up a dvd player.  The AV guy was pissed off (I'm pretty sure that he was pissed cause I'm just a janitor and not only that -- he didn't think of it!)

It worked perfectly.  That AV guy thought it was fluke -- he pulled it off and we moved to another room and he hooked it up - Because you're just a janitor.  Guess what it worked there too.

I explained the differences (or lack thereof) of RCA vs BNC (same analog signal, with a tamperproof connector) to the AV guy and he reluctantly said my idea would work.

He still wanted to use the RF Converters.  The principals backed me up and returned the converters.

I had to fight that AV guy everytime I needed to setup something from then on -- until he got fired for destroying a $3,000 server. Idiot had a pepsi can tip over onto it while he was re-cabling!

Just cause I'm a janitor doesn't mean I'm stupid.

(Edit2) sorry about the numbers and titles. It was way too late for me and I hit post then couldn’t edit the title. It should have read ($1050 saved by janitor) or similar.

"So just a small vent here about somthingthat got me riled up. So a few days ago my father was having computer issues with the picture on his screen. So i automatically assumed it was a out of date driver. 

So with his permission i downloaded Nvidia Geforce (the updater for all Nividia cards) ans ran a check. Sure enough it was extreamly out of date. Now as i ran the update it shows pictures of games ans the update ot called game ready driver because the brand is focused around gaming. I explainee this to him and he understood.

So about a week later i wake up to my father yelling at me telling me i fucked up his computer by downloading a gamer driver. He told me i shouldnt use any programs and should update it directly though the computer (whatever that means). Oh ans to top it off he doesnt want me touching his (my brothers btw) computer anymore.

Maybe i should let this get to me as much but its like i did one nice thing then get yelled at because apparently i messed up a computer because apparently he had 2 graphic drivers running at the same time (However that is possible i dont know) according to him. I just said okay and walked away but this is still frusterating as hell.

Oh to top it off, he used to be a computer engineer so he thinks he still knows everything about computers.",You updated my computer wrong!,0
"Hey there.
 
This Tale is rather short but hilarious. I was working at a big company with couple of 10.000 employees sitting in multiple countries. It was a normal day, but after lunch a strange mail flew into my inbox which simply stated ""This is a test"". Looking at the sender it simply stated ""test@&lt;Company&gt;.com"", where &lt;Company&gt; was the domain for the company I was working for. Before I could even think of what has happened, a second mail came in. Same sender, the contents this time in french and the subject did indicate, that this was an answer to the original mail. Shortly after - more answers. They kept going. 

""What the heck is going on?"" was coming from behind me. Apparently, everyone in our office did receive those messages and my boss was kind of freaking out about it. About 15 minutes later everything stopped - Exchange-Server was not happy and decided to go on vacation, for 2 whole days.

Later the week, we received a statement from the Mail-Team. 
Long Story short: ""test@&lt;company&gt;.com"" was configured to bounce every mail received to all existing mail-addresses with ""@&lt;company&gt;.com"". However the forwarded mail was having ""test@&lt;company&gt;.com"" in the sender-field. This meant replying to the mail would cause the same effect of sending a mail company wide. Some employees were acknowledging the test, others did not understand french and did wanted to know what is going on, basically DOS'ing the Exchange-Server with each reply they made.  
Never thought that something like this can happen to a company that big.

TL;DR: Never set up a mail-account to forward the message to everyone in the company as the original sender (Especially if there is no testing of privilege what-so-ever).",The snowball-effect applied to an Exchange-Server,0
"I got sent on a call out job years ago 


We had a commercial customer who had some employees who were far from technical so there was  always some educating to do


We had a HP 2600n printer installed, for it's time it was a great printer. Four colour laser and network attached

People in the office printed to it via the wireless 


So we had a call that a new senior staff manager was struggling to print and rather than remote support or phone he asked for someone to come on site


I arrive and go into the office that the manager had setup in, the same office the printer was installed in


The printer was gone


Me: where's the printer?

Manager: it wasn't working so I threw it away

Me: What?? Where did you put it,. That printer works great and serves most of the building

Manager: I put it in a skip I don't remember where so it's gone, can you setup this printer on my computer instead 


What he had was a very old thermal fax machine 


Me: that's not a printer, you can't print to it

Manager: well can you buy me a printer so I can work


Now call me paranoid but I think they guy stole the printer and lied about it

"Background, I work in the AV department of a smaller college. AV, means audio visual, but people often mistake us and IT as the same, but it isn't. I work on the projectors, monitors, speakers and control box in each of the classrooms of the college. We get calls that should go to IT all the time, but since they leave at 5, and I work until 8, I sometimes go and see if I can help on IT calls, if i think i can help. 

So, i get a call from a professor asking if i can look at the mouse, as it wasnt working. I told them that it is really more of an IT thing, but i would come down and look at it and see if i can fix it, if not i would get a hold of IT to fix it in the morning. So, i walk all the way across the campus, and up a flight of stairs and into the class. The class is there, bored, waiting for class to start. Everything is quiet. The screen is showing the projector, they're logged into the computer, it looks good until I walk to the podium and immediately see the problem with the mouse. I kind of bite my tongue and ask the teacher what she thinks the problem is, she doesnt answer. Turns out, this is the sign language teacher, and she is completely deaf, and a student called me for her. 

So I ask the student to tell her what the problem was, and because this is an ADVANCED sign language class, most of the class had learned at the very least the basics of sign language. So I wanted to whisper to the professor what it was, because it would make her look stupid to her class, but because she is deaf, she needs it signed to her, and she believes in a ""paperless classroom"" according to the students, and there were no markers to be found for the white board. So after I whispered the problem to the student, and showed her the problem, she burst out laughing like it was the funniest thing she has ever heard.

Once she recovered, she signed (I'm assuming, I dont know sign language) ""YOU WERENT USING THE MOUSE, IT WAS THE ERASER FOR THE WHITE BOARD"" after she was done signing, the professor turned a deep red, and most of the class erupted in a chorus of laughter. I pulled the rolling tray where the mouse and keyboard are, and hiding in the back was the real mouse. I asked if they had any questions and went back to the office. Still one of my favorite stories. Thanks for reading!

Edit: for those curious, here is a picture of the ""mouse."" https://imgur.com/gallery/2pz0Mao

Honestly, it does look a lot like a mouse. I also have a funny story about how a professor was trying to use the wrong remote to turn on a projector in an older room, and the remote was a desk decoration from another professor that shares the room with them. It was a prop from star trek next generation.","Professors complaint: ""My mouse isnt working""",0
"Long time stalker first post so here goes.
This will be a bit long so I can give you some background into this story.

TL:DR at bottom


I was a service tech for 15 years, pretty much anything in an office (computers, printers, copiers, typewriters, camera systems, etc.) but was not formally trained in the field when I first started. I originally went to school for electronics and computers so I had some trouble shooting skills. This tale is of when I went on my first solo call after 3 months of training. I got a LOT more stories so I'll see how this goes and go from there.


When I was hired I was trained as an office equipment tech for mostly copiers, printers, and faxes. I went for ride along with two senior techs for three months to learn the ropes, depending on what we were looking at I'd be with either one. Chris was my main boss, he was a bit of a sales guy but mostly tech. He showed me the ropes and how to make suggestions based from a service stand point, if something could work better for a customers needs by suggesting upgrades or another piece of equipment to handle any issues they were having. 


Now the other tech Scott was a no nonsense, let's get this stuff fixed and move on kind of guy. The first thing he told me and constantly repeated before a call was ""When talking to the about the equipment's issues it's always a minor problem, no matter what the customer says it's a minor problem. I don't care if it's on fire, it's ALWAYS a minor problem."" His reasoning for this was to try and de-escalate any issues they may be having so the customer would hopefully calm down thinking we'd have it fixed in no time. After 15 years I'd say 7/10 issues really are just minor problems, but not this one.


My first solo call was to go on site and replace a belt on an old dot matrix printer (the old ream feed, normally used for reports printer). The customer called in saying the belt that drove the print head busted and they just wanted to order a new one and have it installed once it came in, no initial diagnosis was done by us, its what they wanted. Ok, we order the part and once it comes in my trainers say this will be a good first call to do solo, just a part replacement and cleaning should be easy.



Cue deer in headlights and stomach in throat montage. I get on site and thankfully the printers in a fairly accessible location with a nice big counter for me to work on it. I tear this printer apart, vacuum, blow, and wipe probably 10+ years of dust and crap out of it. Oil up all the shafts and bits that need it. Replace the belt and pop everything back together, not to hard. Now comes the moment of truth, time to test it. I had one of the office girls send a print job to make sure everything is working and it rolls into action. It's sailing back and forth looking like new and I breath a sigh of relief thinking all is well. That is until the printer gets about four pages spit out the back when all of a sudden the print head stops mid stride and a horrible grinding sound is heard coming from the printer, followed by a flame about 5-6 inches coming straight out the top of the printer. Cue me scrambling like a madman to unplug everything from it and make sure the paper doesn't catch on fire. Thank the tech overlords the paper was feeding out the back and I didn't have the top cover shut entirely so I could watch it work. I'm standing there mouth agape and my body soulless, WHAT DID I DO!!! The office girls half snickering half dumb founded and standing behind them is the OWNER OF THE COMPANY!!! Cut to internal monologue of ""Well, I'm dead and fired"". He just saw this whole thing, flames and all and all he does is go ""Huh, cool!"" and proceeds to walk away into his office. I somehow manage to say Scotts line of ""Don't worry, just a minor problem. I'm sure we can fix it"" and I excuse myself so I can go outside and make a phone call.


I ring Chris and Scott, they were normally together when we were slow, and I get ahold of Chris. This is what followed:  
Chris: Yeah, what's up, everything going ok.  
Me: No, not really I had a bit of a minor problem. The um, the printer caught on fire.  
*insert a good minute long pause of dead silence*  
Chris: Come again? I don't think I heard you right.  
Me: I had a bit of a minor problem. The printer caught on fire.  
*insert another 30 second+ pause of silence*  
Chris: Ok, your on speaker Scott's here what EXACTLY has happened?  
Me: *insert above paragraph*  
At this point I can here Scott in the background dying from laughter.  
Chris: We'll what does the owner want us to do.  
Me: I don't know, I didn't ask. I figured I should call you for help, I'm screwed aren't I?  
Chris: Well that depends on what the owner wants to do. Offer to bring it back to the shop so we can look at it, no charge for anything so far. Find out and call me back.  


*Cue dead man walking scene from any prison movie*


I go back inside and head over to the owners office to see what he wanted to do. I explain that I can take it back to the shop and see if we can revive the charred corpse of his printer, no charge for anything so far.  
Owner: Na, just junk it, we've had that thing for ages. It was having issues where it'd just stop mid job for a while anyway. I was just looking up a newer model and it's not too expensive, we'll just replace it.  I'm amazed it didn't die sooner, cool how It caught on fire though. Can you scrap it for us?  
Me: *jaw on floor and stuttering to find words* Absolutely we can scrap it, If you want I can have my boss talk to you about the new printer he may be able to get you a deal.  
Owner: Sure, have him give me a call then.  
I proceed to pack up all my tools and the crispy printer in the van and start to head back to what I'm expecting to be a pink slip. Once on the road I call Chris and let him know what the owner said. He says everything is fine, head back to the shop and they'll meet me there later, bring the printer into the shop and see if I can figure out what happened.


Once back at the shop I took everything back apart and started trying to figure out what the heck happened to make this thing burst into flames. Turns out the print head had bad bushings that rode on the shafts going side to side and that caused it to seize up and wouldn't let the head move. My guess was that the because of the old belt it would just slip due to age and really crappy teeth in the rubber. The motor would keep running even though the printhead was stopped. Well put a brand new (tight, strong, new rubber teeth) belt into this equation and what you get is a motor trying to spin but not able to which caused it to overheat, which made the wires coming off it to get warm and that made the whisper thin coating melt. Once that coating melted the voltage wire hit frame and voltage grounded to frame makes for a VERY hot wire, that proceeded to burn about 4 inched along the bottom of the printer.


About an hour after I get back and am done messing with the printer Scott walks in grinning ear to ear.   
Scott: Where we going after work, I owe you a beer. You did good kid, It's always a minor problem. Something actually caught fire and you stayed true to my advice.   
Chris: Please don't make a habit out of this. But good job, you had crappy situation and you came out ok.  
I had them both take a look at the printer and see what they thought went wrong. They came to pretty much the same conclusion. I lived to try and ""fix"" something else another day.

"Unlike most of the stories here, there are no villains or idiots in this one. We hit a very strange problem and only solved it with a bit of dumb luck.

This took place around 2005 or so - just before the first wave of commercially-available grid computing products. I was working as a developer at a small black box hedge fund and, as is often the case at small hedge funds, my team was also responsible for supporting the trading application we'd built.

We have about fifty active traders at the time. Each trader has three PCs under their desk running our proprietary trading software. Each PC has two screens and is responsible for trading options on ~50 underlying stocks. Our software uses a plug-in model that allows the quants to write pricing strategies in C#.

I've worked with enough quants to know that they're generally brilliant mathematicians and terrible coders. So, when they introduce a pricing strategy that slows the trading machines down dramatically any time it works with an underlying security that pays dividends, I suggest we (the developers) review their code to make it performant.

Absolutely not, the director of the quants tells us. This is QUANT CODE. We would never understand it.

Fine, we can't change the code and the quants are never going to learn how to optimize, so we come up with the solution. The trading machines will hand off market data about the ""problematic securities"" to dedicated machines that will do nothing but crunch price models and then pass the results back. Because the trading machines are all Windows and the quant code is in C#, these machines will be Windows as well and they'll distribute the market data and the pricing models via Microsoft Messaging Queue (MSMQ.) We throw this together and it works remarkably well with one limitation - these are Windows desktops, not servers. They can't connect to more than ten peers at a time via MSMQ.

That's fine for about a month, then we're called into an urgent meeting. The lead trader tells us that someone is hacking into our systems and stealing our pricing data. He knows this because the trading machines are periodically getting selectively disconnected from the pricing machines, but they continue to show a full complement of active connections.

A hedge fund's pricing data is its life's blood. So, we go onto red alert. IT goes over the network access logs and can find no incursion. The developers go over the application logs and don't see any anomalies. All the IP addresses the trading machines are connecting to are in the correct subnet to be pricing servers. Management even brings in an audit team to go over our results in case the whole thing is an inside job by IT or trading systems development to steal the firm's intellectual property.

Roughly six weeks into the investigation, we find a breakthrough. The pricing servers are assigned their IP addresses dynamically and normally wind up with (for example) 10.10.16.1 through 10.10.16.10, but sometimes they skip an address and wind up shifted so that they miss one of the sequential addresses and wind up claiming 10.10.16.11. The trading systems continue to treat this ""missing"" IP address as a pricing machine. They send market data to it, but they never get a price back. We set up an audible klaxon in the server room to go off whenever 10.10.16.11 is claimed.

In the meantime, we rewrite the pricing server and the trading system to have an active handshake during discovery so that we're not wasting bandwidth and time, both of which are at a premium in black box trading. During that time, the klaxon only goes off once and the mysterious problem goes away.

Two weeks later, we've got all the pieces ready to go into production, but the problem's not recurring and deployments are labor intestive (this is before CI/CD.)  We have a meeting in the main IT room so we can include IT without leaving the network unmonitored.

After about an hour, we're going around in circles with no one wanting to take responsibility for a decision to deploy or not to deploy the new code. One of the sysadmins gets a call on his cell phone, answers it briefly, then plugs it into a USB port on his desktop.

The klaxons go off. Sysops jump to see what's going on. The developers all sit where they are and stare at sysadmin's phone. After a few minutes of sysop speak trying to diagnose what caused the IP address to be claimed, my managing director says. ""Jerry, unplug your phone for a second.""

He does and 10.10.16.11 vanishes off the network.

When the smoke clears, we've discovered that the IP theft isn't intellectual property. It's Internet Protocol. Whenever Jerry plugs his phone into a USB port, it claims an IP address. He usually plugs it into a charger on the other side of the room that's not connected to a PC or doesn't plug it in until after the pricing servers have started up for the day. It's only when he plugs it in before or during the pricing server startup sequence that the trading systems discover it, think it's a pricing server, and try to send it market data.

We wound up not needing to install the modified server code, but the IT room does get some huge signs that read, ""Do not plug any devices into sysadmin PCs via USB.""",We have a spy... or a ghost... or something.,0

"Short and sweet.

I'm a Web Developer / IT for a small marketing agency. One of our project managers called me up very concerned about her Macbook.

You see, several websites she had visited were asking for permission to take her computer's  ""cookies"" (I know they were getting permission to store a cookie, not take one, but this is how she read it).

She was concerned about her computer running out of cookies so she had baked some at home and brought a plate to work, but was not sure how to get them into her system.

After realizing she was dead serious I held back my laughter and explained what cookies were. Thankfully she had not tried to actually insert a chocolate chip cookie into her Macbook.  Not sure Apple Care would cover that one.

I couldn't stop laughing for several minutes after that call. They were good cookies though.

"Today I received  an email that an employee needed Acrobat Reader installed so she could open PDF’s on her computer. 
I proceed to remote in only to find Acrobat Reader, already installed, in the middle of her desktop. I’m able to open any PDF I click on with no problem and am confused at the issue. I reply to her email stating that it is already installed and ask if there is a certain file that is she is having issues with. 
Turns out there’s a whole folder of PDF’s she can’t open so I have her show me what the issue is while I am viewing her screen. 

She begins by opening MICROSOFT EXCEL and starts browsing out to said folder and tries opening a PDF and (for obvious reasons) receives an error that it can’t open. 

After 10 minutes of explaining why there was nothing wrong with her computer and that Excel cannot be used to open PDF’s, I think she finally understood that she has to use Acrobat Reader. I guess I’ll find out tomorrow.",Can’t open my PDF’s!,0
"As previously mentioned, senior tech support for the Fruit company.

In this story, the customer called in to do 3 things:

&amp;#x200B;

* Get her email verified on her newly created account;
* Sign in on her new phone;
* Download Whatsapp.

This lady sounded within retirement age and didn't have the first clue about technology. Her account had been created for her and a password was given to her but that was it.

To verify her email, she needed to have access to it. She wouldn't have it on her phone but she had on her computer. 

I screenshare on her computer, go to the webmail page and find she is not signed in and doesn't know the password. Thankfully, I notice a friendly Outlook icon on the task bar and lo and behold, all her emails were there.

Now I needed to send a verification email.

I guided her to the website to sign in to her account: *""Password incorrect""*. ""Try again"", I said. ""*Password incorrect.*""

She never told me the password, but she was mumbling it as she typed. 

And then I heard a ""*space...I...M....*"". I stopped her, most probably failing in compliance for this but I advised her that passwords don't usually contain spaces. She types in the password without spaces and voila, we are in. I quickly told her to mend her written down password.

We send the verification email and verify it promptly. Now came the biggest hurdle. Whatsapp, the bane of my existence. I swear I get a handful of calls everyday related to Whatsapp.

The main issue, however, turned out to be that she wasn't connected to Wi-Fi on her phone. In fact, she had no idea of the *concept* of Wi-Fi.

After explaining her the basics on Wi-Fi, we go back to her computer to see if we can find information on it. However, the PC was linked via ethernet and it didn't have a Wi-Fi card installed, so no way to see the SSID or the password on Windows.

After almost 10 minutes of trying to see if she could see the SSID and password on her router, I gave up. I had 20 minutes before the line closed for the day and if she called back, she could get someone more impatient than me.

I decided to get in to her router settings by typing the IP in the browser. First time success, no password needed. We mess around a bit and there they are, the SSID and the network password (again, probably failing in compliance).

I get her to turn on the Wi-Fi on her phone, type the password and connect... Success. We were in.

We went to download Whatsapp and it asked for her account password. After a couple of minutes explaining the difference between the Wi-Fi password and her account password (from here distinguished between ""the one that starts in 88"" and ""the one without the spaces""), she types it in and Whatsapp is installed.

I help her set it up and then advised her to meet her friends, that know how to use it, and have them send messages so she can reply. 

She was very happy at the end of the ordeal and I left work happy and on time.

"Long has the little black box lived, working dutifully to provide remote support to the special software.  She was always spoken to over the network, but never in person with mouse and keyboard.  She did her job and did it well; the innocuous black box in the desk behind the Engineer.  She could not be virtualized, as the special software only she ran required a physical dongle to be connected.  But she did her job so well and for so long that her physical presence was forgotten about entirely.  

Until one day, some dastardly bandits captured the innocent box when the desk she presided in was thrown away.  The masses cried out in agony as she could no longer be spoken to, unplugged and unpowered, abandoned in the great hall of maintenance.

But she has been rescued, and returned to her rightful place.  She once again resides behind the engineer, next to the metal shelves, partially hidden once again behind the guest chairs.  And the Engineer is grateful, and the masses sing her glory.

"Sorry if this isn't allowed. I read a recent story in another sub and the title reminded me of this.

Little backstory first. I was fresh out of college and working in a third party call center. We mostly did off the shelf software support (mostly Office, Lotus Notes, Photoshop, etc) but could also do some vba and other coding. We had many clients including a bunch of Fortune 500s and some that may piss off taxpayers if they were allowed to know we were outsourced (think city in state x hires us in state y). Most of the time we were not allowed to say we were outsourced, which bring up different stories for a different day. 

Anyways. My training is long over and I'm learning XLVBA to be bale to support it for clients. It's a cold day in the Midwestern us near a spooky lake on the northern border. April 2010. Suddenly hundreds and hundreds of customers are calling in because their computers are constantly rebooting. We all try the basics but soon word gets around that almost all of us are getting basically the same call in both of our locations. 

None of us know what is going on. We're remote so we can't exactly check hardware. We can't remote in due to constant reboots. Then our manager gets an email from McAfee. An update caused SVCHost.exe to be quarantined. They're working on a fix and tell us to  hold tight.

A couple hours later we get another email with a script we have to sideload on every machine. Only we didn't have any admin rights whatsoever. Every time a customer called we had to call their local admins and send them the script to push on their local machines. 

These calls lasted for 3 days. IIRC McAfee publicly stayed that only a small percentage of customers were affected. Based on the volume of calls to my company alone I assume the actual percentage was much much higher.

"This is a short but sweet one.

About 2-3 years ago the organization I work for hired a casual. Her primary role was not tech support, but during her quiet times she'd come over and help us out with the absolute basics of tech support for those who would walk in. Stuff like ""can you restart your machine and try again?"" and ""can you try going to google.com to make sure your internet is working?"". Given that that solved a lot of issues, she was kind of helpful sometimes.

Being a large organization with 2 separate locations, we have a roster of who is working where on which day. It's colour coded, so green is site 1, and yellow is site 2. Find your name, find the day, look at the colour, done.

One day the casual printed out the roster to keep by the desk, but she accidentally printed it in black and white. Rather than print it again in colour, she spent a good while colouring in the black and white roster with a yellow and green highlighter, checking her work against what was on the screen. When we noticed, we asked why she didn't print it out again but in colour. She said ""oh, I didn't think to do that"".

And that's why she only lasted a few months before not getting called back in.","The casual, and the black and white document.",0

Three hours after I get home and start my vacation plans I get a call from one of the vice presidents. He had just bought a new phone on a whim and needed it setup with email and multi-factor authentication for applications we require it on. He needs this all done before Saturday afternoon because he has work that absolutely has to be done and he doesn't have his old phone anymore so he can't use that until I get back.

I sent him the instructions again (while very drunk) at 3 in the morning and he began texting immediately asking for more help.

"Years ago, I worked in support team for various gateway products including an email solution that was installed on various Unix platforms. It's a pretty awesome product, let's call it messagePure.

Now, this product had its own MTA and one or more server(s) with a milter on it so the install and set up normally required an administrator who knew what they were doing.

Roll on and this caller phones in and says that he had run out of disk space on a SAN that had 40GB. Well, this does sound excessive even for larger solutions so I went through the bread and butter stuff with him, yes what he said was verified, there were inodes left so where did space go?... It turned out that he had archiving enabled and was saving a copy of every mail that the policy touched. The simple solution was to clear down the archive as it was a number of years old at this point.

We cleared down the oldest archives and logs with him while he was on the phone and got the solution working again. I then suggested logrotate to keep the space under control. He had never used it before and asked me to ssh in and set it up for him, which I did as its a simple setup. He was happy and I got a 5/5 for the ticket.

6 months later they had another issue and the user blamed me as I  ""must have touched something"". I had no RMA so got yelled at for logging in when the customer asked me to.

"  

A while back, I worked in tech support for an accounting firm. I was the in-office support person, while the other two support team members managed the domain and network remotely. It cut down on a lot of pointless distractions if there was someone in the physical office to handle the standard user issues, so the other two techs could focus on other critical tasks like security, compliance, migration, setting up new hires, archiving and deleting inactive accounts, etc. The firm wasn’t small, but it still was closer to “mom and pops” than being one of the giant firms (only 40-50 users). It was a nice place. Everyone was friendly and on a first-name basis with each other, even the higher ups. While they were all very nice, not everyone was technologically inclined. Guess that’s why I had job there.

This incident occurred around the time after we had migrated over to Office 365 and right after we enabled MFA for all users. The only user with a problem was one of the managers. He was leaving the company soon (amicably and his choice) and only had a few weeks left, so of course he would be the user with the crisis. It had to be the guy with one foot out the door that has a red alert that demands my full attention. Kind of like being forced to repair a Win 7 machine the same day the new Win 10 laptops arrive and are being distributed. Pointless and unsatisfying. After all, without the user who witnessed my labors, who will sing tales of the mighty battles waged by those of us who work in tech support?

Anyway, the manager’s account kept getting locked due to repeated invalid login attempts. We traced the issue back to his phone. He had a phone that looked like it had barely survived a horror movie…cracked screen, chipped plastic, mystery stains, etc. (FYI, he ate at his desk everyday with the phone out, so the mystery was whether a stain was bacon grease from a burger or oil from a pepperoni pizza slice.)

It seemed that even though we had set up his phone correctly for the change, his phone was sending the old login info anyway as quickly and as annoyingly as a kid that keeps repeating “are we there yet?” on a long road trip. Seriously, this phone was hammering his email account every 30 seconds with a wrong password, so no wonder the account kept locking as soon as we unlocked it. I tried the usual steps of checking and re-entering the correct settings and user info. I tried deleting and re-adding the email account. We even reset his account to without MFA to see if the phone would work correctly (which it did not).

The manager was becoming very frustrated. He kept saying, “You have to fix my phone! I need to be able to get emails! I can’t get onto my computer!” (His network login of course locked with his email, so he also couldn’t log on to his computer. He could do literally nothing until it was resolved. Welcome back accounting Flintstones style!)

When the standard fixes failed, I started asking more questions about the phone. Turns out he had been experiencing problems with a lot of apps since the last phone OS update. I realized the update probably didn’t install correctly when during my questions he revealed that he ran the OS update while the phone wasn’t connected to a power source (even though you’re supposed to have it plugged in for an update…..says so on the update screen and everything. And yes, he manually told the update to proceed anyway while unplugged). 

He had started the update, the phone died, he charged it, and the phone seemed to continue with the update upon charging/rebooting. Likely culprit identified!

For clarification, the company had a BYOD policy option, so it was his phone and he controlled the update process. I’d have preferred company provided devices for more control and tighter security, but it wasn’t my choice. We just changed some default settings for security and installed some additional security software, but other than that, it was still his phone.

You’d think that finding the culprit meant a solution was at hand, but this is where it got interesting. I tell him we should backup the phone, reset the OS to factory, and import his data back to the device after doing a fresh update. He looks horrified at the suggestion….and I mean the “you just ran over my puppy in front of me” horrified.

Manager: “You can’t do that! Stop!”

Me: “I haven’t done anything yet and why not? Don’t worry. We’ll make a local backup as well as one to the cloud, so you don’t need to worry about losing any data if that’s your concern.”

This is when manager tells me that he and his wife are in the middle of a very nasty divorce. I felt for the guy, as he was otherwise a nice guy and obviously under a lot of stress from his personal life. He says he has texts on his phone from her that he needs as “evidence” (evidence of what? I didn’t ask). I told him that we could preserve the texts, take screenshots, back them up to a service, and/or even print them out, scan them, and email pdf copies on the texts for him (and printed copies might even be easier for presenting during divorce proceedings).

Manager: “No! No! NO! Her lawyers will say they’re fake! I need them on the phone as they are, not some copy! I can’t risk it!”

Me: “Ok, well, maybe we could delete your email from the phone. You have your laptop, so you can still check email when at home.”

Manager: “No, I need it on the phone too! I don’t want to keep my laptop open at home, so you have to fix it!”

Me: “We’ve tried everything we can with this phone besides restoring it to factory. Since your phone is in such bad shape physically, how about a new one?”

Manager: “No, I need this phone!”

Me: “Maybe we could email the boss and request a used smartphone. Some of them are pretty cheap secondhand, and it would only be for you to use for a few weeks. We can express one and take it down to \[the company’s mobile provider\] store for a new sim card/number on the company account. Your personal phone could remain untouched and as-is, and you’d have a separate company phone for the email.”

Manager: “No, I don’t want to carry two phones! I’ll forget one! Hurry up and fix it! I need to get onto my computer and do my accounting stuff \[I don’t remember the actual jargon he used\] for the client NOW!”

Me: “Well, could you at least turn your phone off until we discuss a solution, so it stops hammering the email server? That’s the only way to unlock your account so you can get back on.”

Manager: “No! I have a kid and his school might call me with an emergency!” (I don’t know why he didn’t give his direct office line to the school for his contact info as well as his mobile.)

The manager was becoming increasingly frustrated and shot down every compromise or solution I had. I felt bad for the guy, but the more frustrated and unreasonable he got, the more my nerves were beginning to fray.

Manager just kept insisting: “Just fix my phone! Don’t delete anything! Don’t give me another phone! Don’t turn it off! Don’t remove the email! Just fix it! You’re IT! You have to fix it!”

Me: “I don’t know what you want. You keep saying fix it, but also don’t touch it, do anything to it, or make any changes of any kind. That’s not possible! It defies the laws of reality!”

After 30 minutes of his increasingly loud demand for the impossible, and with no reasonable compromise or solution accepted, I just began waving my hands over the phone to “summon the gods of tech support.” (Yes, I literally, began waving my hands over the phone and chanting because subtle sarcasm is not my strong suit.)

Me: “Oh mighty gods of tech support, lend me your power, I beg of you! Abracadabra! Hocus Pocus! Sim Sim Salabim and wonder twin powers activate! Ooga Booga! Evil Spirits Be Gone! The power of Cheez Whiz compels you!”

The manager just looks at me like I’ve completely lost my mind while I chanted.

Me: “It doesn’t seem to be working! We’re losing him! If only my wand wasn’t in the shop! I’m sorry, but we’ve done all we can. The rest is in God’s hands. He’s dead, captain.”

And with that, I just turned and walked out of his office.

Hey, I’m an 80’s kid, so when I decided to fake chant to make my point, I couldn’t help but give as many nods to my childhood as possible. I’m not sure if he got the specific references, but there was no missing my point. 

Half an hour later, he called me back in and had me remove the email account from his phone. Once he had calmed down after I'd left, he’d thought about it and decided he could keep his laptop open at home because he was only there for a few more weeks anyway. He started laughing and with a smile called me a jerk for putting on my “magic show.”

In the end, nothing too dramatic. No villains, no revenge, no arrests. Just a frustrated slightly tech challenged manager going through a rough patch. Not a bad guy, just expecting miracles….and me without my wand.","Sorry, but my wand is in the shop",0
"First i know many will think i make this up or tell an old tale again, but this happend to me personally and is entirely true.Its freely translated and i tryed to recreate the conversation but it was very close to this:

    ME: please go with the mouse on the remotesupport icon and double click.
    customer: what is that icon
    me: describing the icon and how it looks
    customer: searching,... a lot, oh yes i found it, is it like this (describing it)
    me:yes please move your mose onto that incon and double click it

but it didnt worked.oh well we had that before (people cannot double click as they are to slow yes this happens too)

    me: uhm try to click the left mousebutton twice in a row very fast, like click click click
    customer: (cliking the hell outta this mouse) nothing happens.
    me: really nothing?
    me: ok, please click with the right mouse button on the remotesupp. 
    icon you will see the menue. top option should be open do you see it
    
    customer: no, (reads menue one by one)
    me: ok please follow exactly as i say and do nothing in between or anticipate anything,
     just be my hand. 
    (users like to think for themself which is never good).......

\--- couple of minutes later (actually a lot), a few tries, still same menue, hold on he is reading the context menue of the desktop

    me: ok seem like you still clicking on the desktop and missing the icon,

still no joy and i was thinking what could causing him not be able to click that icon, we go back and forth a bit then it hit me

    me: sir when you move your mouse do you see how the mouspointer moves
    customer: what mousepointer
    me: that white arrow, do you see it ?
    customer: (searching...processing information...) 
    oh yes i see it but when i put the mouse on it, it doesnt move.
    me: when you do what? how do you.....

Wait a second, WHAT?

    me: uhm, you hold your mouse on the pointer? on the monitor?
    customer: yes, ofc

     please move the mouse on the table you see the pointer moving...

"This is a old one but as it is some time ago i can just recall the highlights.

I used to work in the first level tech support line of a big name internetprovider company here in germany. There are so many stories. One of the more memoral stories is about an elderly lady who called us, because her internet didn´t work, but her landline, which was also from us did. Now if someone of a certain age is calling us, the first challenge is to find out WHAT the problem is. Not what caused it but what is currently wrong. So her internet is not working and she asked, if we can send one of our technicans out? Sadly i can´t put in a ticket for a technican in our system, without asking the usual questions first. How is the modem? Did she switched it off and on again. And all the other annoying questions everyone complains about. As most customers we have, she didn´t care to answer the questions and if i can just send out a technican because her internet isn´t working and this is what she is paying us for. And if i can´t do it maybe she should call the other ""big company name everyone in germany knows in bright pink"" and become a customer there? In the meantime i got a read of the modem and the line and everything seemed fine and dandy. Also as i said she still could call us over her landline. And suddendly she dropped the bomb. Her ""My laptopscreen is still black."" Again we are a internet provider. We don´t sell laptops or anything. So i asked again. 

Me: So it´s not your internet, but your laptop screen is black? 

She: Yes, it´s black, because my internet doesn´t work. And as you are my internet provider, it´s your fault. And you need to send a technican out to fix it.

Me: I can send a technican out if you want, but in this case we would need to charge you for it. We only provide our technicans for free, if our wire is broken.

She: Well it doesn´t work. And i am not paying for it. You are providing my internet. And as the screen is black, because of  your internet, this is the reason why it´s black. 

Me: I am sorry but this is not the reason why it´s black. Clearly the internet is working as we both are talking with each other. This means there is a signal. I sadly can´t support you for your blackscreen and recommend that you should bring your laptop to a repair shop. 

She: Well i will not bring my laptop again to a repair shop, i just brough it to one last week. I really should become a customer of ""company in bright pink and with a catchy tune"". They would send me a technican.

Me: Ma´am you can do it. But i am honest with you now, you saying that our service is responsibel for your black screen is like pointing at the street and blaming it for your car not starting. You told me now that you already had a problem in the past with your laptop and i am sorry but again, your internet has nothing do with it. If i send you a technican he will bill you. The end result was that we ended the call and me having talked 25 minutes about a problem with our service, which was not a problem.",We broker her Laptop,0
"Customer with many chain store, configuring a new master config for the stores VPNs.

for security reasons stores have only one vpn to main network. no access from the outside to a store.now ofc, since reconfig the VPN is touchy and used routers are potatoes (small stores with often only one computer so who cares) i usually setup a temporary acces to the router itself from the outside, reconfig the vpn and close it up right after.

but at this one, things are different. its behind a cable modem and for some reason that modem is not briding but masquerading. so no outside access without portforward on that router and i dont have its password, its 9pm so noone to ask.

    allright lets roll the dice, putting in router config, as testet and already 
    running on other identical stores.....

oups, router gone, connect gone, no reconnect. thing plays dead.now what. either wait till morning (they open to early for my taste) phonecall the sotre clerk, trying him to get remotesupport running, which will be hard as he wont have also no dns without VPN and possible no admin rights on his machine to reset the tcpip config...

hmm or lets try something else.

    phone call to the provider, finding that store, let him diagnose if router and modem is up - is up
    now lets try some convincing
    
    me: uhm look here is what i did, i need you do give me port forwarding on that router to this 
    port so i can remote in and undo my own damage.
    provider: we cant do that, we cant really verify who you are, you mgiht wanna try gain access
    me: shure, then again i would need to know the credentials, i just need 2 minutes, 
    or ive to drive 300km 
    me: i can even tell you the outside ip and everything, 
    provider: do you have access to the email that account is registered
    me: yea i do, just no clue on which that thing goes. that company has endless
     many mailboxes that could be used for this store, maybe even the former IT service company,
     can you tell me that email that was used
    provider: naa cant tell you that you have to know that
    me: uhm, shit, is it.... adress1,2,3,4.... 

we go back and forth, but thankfully he can kinda relate :)also i can feel his pity me trying to find out which mail the customer used,.. its a bit messy...

    provider: allright can you tell me some details, like which type of router, its ip,... 
    me:yea,..type of potatoe, type of custom firmware... ip uhm dont really know, 
    didnt setup that thing
    provider: allright i give you 2 minutes 

Bingo, releave.

he activated port forwarding, i remote in, and since i still need to reconfigure that thing and not only get it back up, try to troubleshoot it in 2 minutes  and reset config.....

many fast clicks and types later its backup, provider deactivates portforwarding again.

&amp;#x200B;

turns out, while all stores have identical routers and firmware, there are minor version differences in a very few.now i had a faulty option in the vpn main config (something about agressive reconnect and reducing timeout time) that was simply ignored in the later versions, but trow up the minor ealier one. vpn service simply didnt start because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

bottom line,

\-never rely on errorhandling trough different versions of software, even minor ones, you never know

\-check your logs in the lab that they are absoltuly error free, working is not enough, even or specially its late

\-to much security is not always a good thing, sometimes a hole saves the day

"Today I got a call from a user that needed the latest version of iTunes on his computer. But it wasn't available from our software store. He asked me if, since he had an admin PC, he could uninstall the iTunes from us and downloaded it on his own.

Here's the crux, we don't have support on admin PC's. But I figured a simple yes or no would be fine. I guessed the answer was yes, but to verify I told the user I would be right back and put him on hold. I walked over to our coaches and asked if my guess was correct. They said yes, *but* the lack of support to admin PC's goes so far that I can't tell him that.

I return to the user and inform him that sadly our support doesn't cover his PC, and it apparently goes so far that I can't answer this question.

The user sighs and asks if at least could help him uninstall the iTunes from our store, because he can't find the uninstall option in Software center (where all our software is found). I inform him that I am afraid I can't do that either.

User: ""So you can't help me get rid of a program *you* installed on my PC?""  
Me: ""Sadly, no.""

The user was quiet for a few seconds and then this conversation followed:  
User: ""... Say I was using *another PC*. How would I go about uninstalling a program?""  
Me: ""... Well... If you are using another PC I would tell you to open Control panel and go to uninstall programs. But this is *only* for other PC's of course. PC's that aren't admin PC's.""  
User: ""Of course. Of course. I would never do this on an admin PC. I am using this other PC next to it. I promise.""  
Me: ""Good. We wouldn't want to break the rules for the support.""  
User: ""Heavens, no. I would never ask you to do something like that.""

I then ended the call and split the call in to two cases. One for the iTunes thing where he was denied support. And a separate one where he asked my about how to uninstall a program on a nondescript computer.

I have been in similar situations before. Situations where I could have used some loophole to help a user. But the user had been so rude and unpleasant that I chose not to. So it was nice to talk to someone who understood that I didn't make the rules.",Tech support can be really helpful if you aren't rude to us,0
"So like the title says, this story was taking place during the mid 90s. I was working as a desktop support tech for this company. There was no remote access so in most cases, I would just walk to the customer's office and solve the issue there.

This particular ticket was from somebody in payroll who was complaining that their desktop couldn't print. When I arrived at the person's office, He explained that he's trying to send this document to the department printer which was down the hall but it won't come out. He then explained that this is a sensitive document so he is going to leave me in the office and wait by the printer so he could grab the print out before someone would see it. I sat down at his chair and looked at the document. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was an excel file that contained a table with columns that looked somewhat like this:

First Name
&amp;nbsp;
Last Name

Salary

I took a few seconds to look through the data. I was particularly interested in the people who were working in my department, but as I was scrolling through, I saw a lot of information. I was tempted but decided not to save the document to a network share. I fixed the printer issue, checked that the guy got it and left.

"We'll call $TeamMember1 the target of my frustration.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently joined a company on the  team of process/product owners. This is a fairly new team so there are no documents or guides for how we should all work together outside of standard project documentation. Recognizing this, our team leader advised us to work together on getting to know how each-other works and finding ways to standardize things like request forms, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am the new guy being that I came from outside of the company. I am also the most technical since I came from a system administrator role. Plus, I love tech and feel it is grossly under-considered in process/business structuring. Thus, I have been informally recognized as ""the tech guy"" on the team.

&amp;#x200B;

To kick off our project we scheduled an internal demo of PowerApps by one of the AVPs who works closely with our leader. I had a week or two of time before the meeting. So, decided to dig in myself and begin learning how it works with flow and Sharepoint to prepare for any dev questions I was struggling with. 

The meeting starts and $TeamMember1 has not shown up because of an emergency she's dealing with. No biggie. I set the scope of the meeting and he begins walking through some templates and generally having an open forum discussion with us. I bring up that our Sharepoint is an on-prem copy and begin asking how he's managed to develop in the on-prem site without offloading to our App-Dev team who is offshore and sucks balls.

&amp;#x200B;

About 15 minutes into the meeting $TeamMember1 comes barreling into the room apologizing profusely and blatantly frazzled. We assure her it's fine and I continue my discourse with the AVP. He mentions that there is a gateway already set up and we agree a follow up for him to walk me through how he set it up for his team would be ideal. Immediately after, $TeamMember1 jumps in and says something along these lines:

""Hey, sorry guys, I know I was late and don't really know what we are talking about. This tech stuff sounds like you're talking Chinese to me. But, $Voxmanns, I just want to remind you that the point of this meeting was for us to meet as a team and learn about PowerApps and how we can use it for this project. $AVP we are..."" and goes for an additional 10 minute explanation of the ENTIRE scope of the project after calling me out in the meeting as if I was off topic and had not already done this. 

That's fine. I can give a pass on this and just say I would have done it differently for sure. I bite my tongue through the explanation and let her have some discourse with the AVP without interrupting to let her catch up. This is when I learned she's one of those people who just doesn't have an understanding of how flexible modern technology is - asking very simple functionality questions like ""Can we log notes"" and things along those lines. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, we got to a point where we were discussing documentation and adding attachments. From my short time with PowerApps and Sharepoint I had read that attachments aren't always great since Sharepoint items aren't structured to function as a document library. So, seeking a solution I asked the AVP ""Hey, do you think it's better for us to keep separate documents and update PowerApps separately (double work but separation) or do we go directly through PowerApps and use screens as separate documents?""

Before he can answer, $TeamMember1 butts in and says ""No, they need to be separate."" I can do one, I can do plenty from seniors and superiors. I have little patience for my teammate interrupting me twice in the same meeting because they don't get the picture. The following exchange occurred between her and I:  


$Voxmanns: ""Why do they need to be separate?"" (with a firm but polite tone)

$TeamMate1: ""We need some documents signed off by SVPs, present them as PDFs, etc. We need to have the document separate from the app.""

$Voxmanns: ""So, PowerApps can't do that?""

$TeamMate1: ""Well, it's an application to be used for forms and organizing. And I know what you do is a little bit different than what me and (other teammates) do but at least for our process we need to have the documents separate."" (She likes playing the 'you're different' card on me)

$Voxmanns: ""Okay, so we need document versions of the form. Are you saying PowerApps can't do that?""

$TeamMate1: ""Well, I haven't used it very much so I-""

$Voxmanns: ""Okay,"" turning to the AVP ""Can PowerApps export to PDF or other documents?""

$AVP: ""Yeah, PowerApps can export"" and goes on to say the importance of mulling ideas over and over to find the best way forward (I am guessing he saw my frustration).

&amp;#x200B;

Admittedly, I need to work with a thicker skin, or at least hide it better. Asking the ""Do you know that"" question seemed to work and will hopefully work in the future with her. It is just incredibly difficult to work with a teammate who has to assert their control and does not consider anything they don't understand as a reasonable solution to explore. Hey, totally open to any stories or tactics you all use when dealing with these types of people - it's definitely one of my weak points. Felt nice to shut down the document rebuttal, though! I'll call it a draw for now haha.","We Can't Do That, I Don't Know Why",0
"**SETTING:**  
Mid 1990s at a large, multi-national cutting-edge high-tech company

**BACKSTORY:**  
We had introduced networked PCs for all engineers and most technicians in our division. We were provisioning them and supporting them ourselves because corporate IT didn't exist yet. Because of the primitive nature of networking for MS Windows, we were using DEC Pathworks and our DEC VAX 11/780 mainframe as a server for file shares. And DEC's version of email.

This DEC VAX was the computer that supervised the entire, very sensitive, very high-tech research and development factory.  This factory operates 7x24. Now, we operated this computer to be ultra-reliable because factory downtime cost 1.5 million USD per hour. We had only one scheduled annual warm-down for 12 hours between Christmas and New Years when the factory was idling.

Then corporate started putting together our first IT department made up of PC enthusiasts with that wild-west frontier spirit of that era in computing. Along with the development of corporate IT, they rolled out cc:Mail as the corporate email solution.  

Now, IT didn't have any presence at our campus as we had been self-sufficient up to that point. So there were no IT servers on our campus. But they needed some file shares for the cc:Mail databases that made the application operate.  So, we created several file-shares on our VAX to support their cc:Mail services. (Each database/fileshare could support only a few hundred users).  That worked pretty well except that cc:Mail was rather flaky and had a rather high failure rate.

Now, IT's solution to everything was to simply reboot. Which is fine for an end-user client machine. But you can't go around willy-nilly rebooting servers where users have open documents, etc.  But the IT of that era hadn't yet developed that kind of customer-centric mindset. So that is the back-story that led up to... 

**THE PLAYERS:**  
Me and Corporate Help Desk (CHD)

**THE INCIDENT:**  
*One hot August afternoon I was building new client systems and answering our Help Desk. The fateful call comes in.*

Me: ""Hello, {department} PC Help Desk, how can we help you?""

CHD: ""Hello, this is the corporate help desk. We are having problems with one of the cc:Mail databases on your campus. To clear the problem, can you re-boot the server where that database is provisioned?""

*Now, I had never had the CHD call us. Usually, it was the other way around, I had to call THEM for something.*

Me: ""Well, that database is served from our factory mainframe and we can't just reboot it whenever we please.""

CHD: ""But what will it take to reboot that server?""

Me: ""The next scheduled re-boot of that server is Christmas day. Would you like to hold?"" 

*Yes, I admit that was rather snarky of me and I wanted to see what was their reaction. We had VERY different concepts of operating network services.*

CHD: *Long silent pause. I thought maybe the call had dropped.  But finally they replied:* ""Well, I guess we will have to find some other way to clear the problem.  Thank you.""

I like to think the I gave them a little encouragement to develop more user-friendly ways of handling problems like this.

**AFTERMATH**  
A few years later, management decided to revert to IT-supported office computing services rather than rolling our own.  But on OUR terms. We had a critical list of 20-30 Best Known Methods (BKMs) and SOP that we had developed to keep computing and networking in their place, as aids to doing business, rather than distractions and hindrance to getting the work done.  

We met with the corporate IT people and presented our list. Their reaction to the items on the list ranged from mystified to horrified. They proceeded to cross off almost every point and argued that they couldn't possibly do business like that.  But we insisted, and it took almost 2 years to transition from our office computing environment to the corporate IT provided solution.

A few months after the transition period, our division had moved into a new campus, we were operating with IT supported office networking and computing.  And then corporate IT proudly announced their new office computing initiative.  Oddly enough, it contained almost exactly the list that we had originally presented to them.

"So here's how it worked: These incredibly complex ""black boxes"" for military aircraft would be returned from the field with tags affixed by the (fucking awesome) local repair crews explaining the deficiency. These guy knew their shit I tell you!  

The shipping containers were always opened with a company rep (me) and a gov't rep (we'll call him Tito) present.

Tito was kind of a dick. He would always look to find a way to ensure the defect was covered under warranty. I get it, I'm a taxpayer too.

The first one I recall, we open the shipping container and remove the shoebox size ""black box"" and there is a clear and present footprint on the top of the device. Someone had actually used it as a foot stool.  
Me: ""Warranty exclusion.""  
Tito: ""Are you kidding me?""

(We had times where one of our 'things' went to shit and everyone worked around the clock until it was right. We understood the job, we understood the risks to our Flyboys/girls and dammit, we fucking took it seriously!)

One of the last times I saw Tito, he was in the middle of trying to shut down the entire production line for what amounted to a very minor deficiency. (The kind of thing that would normally be caught and corrected using our typical procedures, which were pretty fucking impressive!)

Me | client

Client: I'm calling about our entire office being down 

Me: has this just happened or is it an existing ticket?

Client: Just happened!

Me: ok so let's check the physical side of things - where are you now? (I start pinging the wan ip which is up)

Client: I'm in front of a desk phone that has a red x on it and something about no dhcp

Me: ok so I'm getting a response from your modem there so internet is working, might be something inbetween your computer and the modem. Can we go into the server room

Client: ok, btw, I came into setup 2 new users and I can't hang around. I've got 2 hours to do this in

Me: we're handling it

Client: I'm in the server room, what am I looking for

Me: judging from the site photos you should have some switches that connect all your computer's to the modem to get internet. Are the switches on?

Client: what are switches? Can you just send someone because the directors are starting to yell?

Me: I need to verify some things before my manager will send someone (I didn't mention call out fees but I did mention we don't have a pool of helpful garden gnomes that have nothing to do, because they're currently at client sites) I've sent you a photo circling the switches

Client: ok so now what

Me: are the switches on?

Client: yes

So we get her laptop plugged directly into each switch. One switch doesn't provide her laptop with the web bits

Me: ok this is the troublesome switch. Can you pull the power on it

Client: ok one sec

(In reality it took longer)

It's powered up and still no change. We unplugged some cables and plugged them back in and it felt like I was starting to burn time

Now I won't go into detail, but basically I was escalating, then that was getting escalated, all the while the customer is complaining about it not working, how they're freaking out... at one point they asked how they could work :

Me: you can make sure the printer is in a wall port that goes to the second...

Client: too hard. Can't you just get it to work

Me: *pause* yep, just the way I told you. Or you can stand directly in front of the switch

Client: I'll stand, this couldn't have happened at a worse time

So I'm getting push back from my escalation point, being asked questions like ""have they messed with anything on the switch"", and checking the trunk ports between switches... all valid but still frustrating when I'm trying to placate a site contact.

"Per popular choice on [the previous tale](https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/d9idlt/we_will_contact_your_shortly_a_game_of_clue/), today's tale will be the beginning of The Beehive arc, which should be a three-parter.

This tale takes place in the end of my career at _$agency_. I was now one of the oldest there, with same _$boss_ and _$pm_ from before but now supported with _$kohai1_ (and _$kohai2_ later) for dev work, and many other marketing/design colleagues.

------

The first time I met _$queen_ was on a minor project during training, I found odd that the Head of Digital Marketing was there, but she made relevant SEO remarks on our delivered product. But I realized this was a cover to meet with _$boss_ to discuss a big upcoming project, despite us being miles away from home and the clock being 7pm.

Said project is another story I wasn't involved much at first since we were not chosen for the dev part. But when it got FUBARed we took over but that doesn't deserve a tale of its own.

I compare organizations with shareholders as beehives. Like every company, they need to output honey and keep the hive healthy and workers busy. But inevitably, the beekeepers take their share and split hives as they please, they might have feelings for their bug slaves but the honey must flow. So they buy queen bees and just drop them in the hive to be accepted by the workers.

Since the previous six figure failure, _$queen_ was moved to a new company but weirdly enough in the same market and recently acquired by a trust fund, still as Head of Digital Marketing. Maybe somebody had a friend high up ?

The other moving part of the Beehive tale is _$hostingProvider_ which is also a beehive of sort. Despite being a local company, they had been acquired by a much larger US based group. _$hostingProvider_ was mostly telco but with a solid sales team of all-flavours-of-EU speaking bees, so they also provided hosting services.

We already worked with them for the same minor project I mentioned previously, so the pattern was quite clear when _$queen_ asked us to switch from their current hosting provider to _$hostingProvider_.

We were knee-deep in our audit of their current ecommerce infrastructure and multiple brands they managed, which in itself was ""funny"" since the first meeting we had was about the revamp of their corporate website.  
_$boss_ and _$queen_ at it again.  
A deal was struck to employ us for 2 days a week starting now, mostly to fix all their issues with _$bigEcommerceCms_.  
So it was a another fun surprise when we were asked to handle the switch to _$hostingProvider_, but come on, ""you already know them and how they work, and they know how you work !"".  

It was true we had another unrelated client with a _$bigEcommerceCms_ instance hosted by _$hostingProvider_, so _$boss_ and _$queen_ must have rejoiced. But this is the tale of ""The 10 pages requirement you regret you billed us 1 hour"", we had total control of the sales and dev environment, not here.

Now the crux of today's tale is that _$previousProvider_ was also the agency responsible for everything technical up to now, so they were pretty pissed at _$queen_. This was shown by giving them and thus us a hard deadline to move everything before they shut their machine.

And we were talking about at least 4 instances of _$bigEcommerceCms_ in various conditions and versions, multiple static website from years old HTML pages to Flash based one, all around a dozen of domains. The only solace in this is that they already had moved their email to Office 365, so we didn't have to think about that.

So the marketing bees were harassing us with tickets about their needs of custom stats export, years old bug they thought could be finally be fixed and various questions and sales operations, and at some point I told _$pm_  we had to focus on the switch and nothing else.

Given the deadline, this was already eating up their 2 allocated days. Despite the years, management was not much more efficient so the deadline was rapidly visible even behind the mountain that was our backlog. _$Kohai1_ was still in training for _$bigEcommerceCms_ so I assigned him the small stuff and handled everything else including most of the project management work.

Up to now _$queen_ had been mostly bugging us with technical questions about _$bigEcommerceCms_ performance and modules since she wasn't up to speed with their brands and catalog. And having a good chat with her _$hostingProvider_ sales team friend. Despite our now paused infra audit, she took the decision to order a load-balanced set of machines : 2 prod machines behind a load balancer, 1 for global db and assets storage and 1 for preprod needs.

Now mind you this was not our other client setup, the first time we had a load-balanced infra, and the only _$hostingProvider_ technician familiar with both _$bigEcommerceCms_ and the foul language we speak was US-based and half a day away. 

Oh and they used the worst ticketing system I've ever seen and we were second-grade users since not directly client of the mother-ship company.

Now 5000 signs in, you have the full context for this tale and future parts. I wont leave you without what the title promised :  

__The (Friday) night I bricked a server__

----

Since non switch-related issues were still actively pushed all week, I arrived Friday with merely a plan, an energy drink, and the assurance everybody had been briefed on how the ball was supposed to roll.

The morning was spent smoking the bees and reminding them to end their business by noon before downtime. Afternoon was spent copying _$bigEcommerceCms_ instances and other websites from _$pissedPreviousHostingProvider_.  
Of course _$queen_ wasn't happy we couldn't use the downtime to slip a patch or two, but the custom CRM integrations was full of hard coded paths merely not yet detected by our audit and she forgot some website were hosted elsewhere than on _$pissedPreviousHostingProvider_. Luckily they had the credentials, so on the list it goes. 

So it was already 4pm when everything was OK on the preprod machine despite the config being far from what our other combo of _$bigEcommerceCms_@_$hostingProvider_

I asked _$queen_ on the phone to verify all preprod versions :

&gt; _$me_ : Is everything OK to you ? Instances are perfect copies before downtime, so all orders of this morning are accounted for.  
&gt; _$queen_ : yeah but _$shittyStaticSite_ is an old version, and our shareholders are reviewing all of our domains so _pls fix it ASAP_

I had 4 websites full of honey not live at 4.30pm on a friday when I called _$pissedPreviousHostingProvider_ who gave us the previous SFTP access :

&gt; _$me_ : Hi $pissedTechnician, _$queen_ is telling me $domain is invalid, could you look at your config ?  
&gt; _$weekendAwaitingTechnician_ : (After a few minutes) Yeah your access was linked to a previous vhost folder, our bad.  
&gt; _$me_ : Thanks I got it, I'm sorry to ask but when are you leaving ?  
&gt; _$cleaningDeskTechnician_ : in about 30 min, why ?  
&gt; _$me_: Just in case anything happens...  
&gt; _$pissedTechnician_ : You know our deadline is set in stone right ? And is today. We won't host anything on Monday even if you ask nicely or with honey. (_Thank $queen for that you fool_)  
&gt; _$faunaHatingFool_ : Yeah I know, just 30min and after that I'm on my own.

Luckily during the week I had time to tweak my previous bash script responsible for copying instances of _$bigEcommerceCms_ and automatically adjust some server/db/cms settings to handle Prod VS Preprod. 

It was a beauty of cobbled together variables representing the multiple machines (Prod being 2 IPs + 1 shared storage and Preprod 1 IP + same storage) and databases, and I was very proud that it could be launched from any machine to another and `rsync/ssh` would gently do its job.

Each website was a parameter of the script, along with a keyword for source and one for destination. I didn't test machine to machine copy, but I was confident my gigantic switch to generate machine related variables would work.

Now that everything was OK on Preprod at 5pm, I used the script to copy _$shittyButNowCorrectStaticWebsite_ to please _$queen_, and it worked flawlessly, from Preprod to both Prod machines. All according to keikaku all I had to do was copy everything to Prod machines and ask for DNS modification.

As I was preparing to copy _$bigEcommerceCms_ instances, _$boss_ and _$pm_ comes by and asks me if everything is alright. I rant about _$queen_ and _$currentlyAtThePubTechnican_ warning and tells them this should be the yearly instance of Friday deployment they'll pay overtime. They laugh and leave, everything is OK and I hit Enter on my third monitor since _$kohai2_ had not yet stole it.

Now all commands were encapsulated in SSH commands for them to work on any machine, and verbose so that I could have an ETA on operation. And I didn't like the currently rolling folders of my ""delete before copy"" operation so I canceled it quickly. I realized they didn't mention my vhosts at all, but much more close to root folders.

I open my 100% correct script that previously worked for _$staticWebsite_ to check the operation :

    rm -rfv /$Folder    
    cp -Rv /$Folder

This is of course a dramatization of the script, but the keenest among will see that `/$Folder`is a very dangerous construct.

Because sure enough, I launched my script without specifying the final parameter of destination since I was distracted. Therefore $Folder is empty, and the SSH connecting to localhost. 

__I've just `rm -rf /`ed my preprod server I spent the day crafting.__ 

Thanks _$boss_, thanks _$queen_, thanks _$hostingProvider_ and their custom folder config which required me to change how folders were concatenated.

_____

I was alone, I could have shouted. But the cold sweat of my greener days never came. The _$senpai_ of my previous tale was long gone, I had long since took its place.

Bricking a machine was also not my first rodeo of this kind, so I didn't chastise much of _$Kohai1_ when he `rm -rf`ed his preprod vhost and all associated backups (we grabbed from offsite), or later _$kohai2_ when he `chmod 7XX`ed his cloud machine (we reinstalled in 5 min).

_$Kohai1_ chose anger and spent the week ruminating his mistake. _$Kohai2_ was green and spent 10 min frozen in fear hidden behind his wall of monitors before calling for help.

I therefore transcended my exhausted mortal body to grab the title of Sensei with my bare hands, attaining peace. I floated among lotuses and no bees were in sight.

Not a single thought of rage or regret passed upon me, no doubt in my skills and what the future was holding.

I must say this was a profound personal experience since I was on a spiritual path for some time to cope with my environment. I'm not ashamed of my blunder, and I'm proud of how I handled the consequences despite the madness around me. The mark of a truly desperate professional.

----    

On the mortal plane, I just sighed :

    $ root@preprod : ls -al
    $ root@preprod : ls command not found   

Yep, I'm fucked. Machine is bricked.

I call _$queen_ :

&gt; _$me_ : Hey _$queen_, don't worry if _$staticWebsite_ is no longer online, I've hit a pothole and need time to fix it up.  
&gt; _$queen_ : Nothing major I hope ? I'm heading home so here's my personal number.  
&gt; _$me_ : I'll keep you posted and will call you to handle DNS on your side.  

I texted _$boss_ and _$pm_ as well.

All I had to do was re-copy everything manually from their source. Some stuff could be salvaged from Preprod via `scp`, and the autoconfig part of my workflow was a sub-script I could trigger manually. _$pissedHosting_ didn't cut our access yet, maybe they felt guilty for that vhost.

It was 10.30pm when I called back _$queen_ :

&gt; _$me_ : Everything is copied on both machines, here's the load balancer IP again. You do your DNS magic.  
&gt; _$queen_ : Thanks, but I can't leave without giving you my utmost gratitude. No company has gone this kinda of length for us before, I know I was making the right choice picking you. Don't worry, all the shareholders will know your effort, and I won't forget it.  
&gt; _$me_ : Thanks, but right now I need to eat something. See you on Monday for postmortem.  

The keenest among you will sure have picked that _$queen_ was in charge of DNS, not the IT department. And during the whole story, was much more tech-savy than your run-of-the-mill marketing bee. This will of course bode well for the future.

"Obligatory first post, mobile user, yadda yadda. This was an interaction I've just had with a fellow developer at work. 


I get back from seeing a user and one of the new devs calls me over, saying he's just found a bug, and he sounds really excited. He's only been here a few weeks but is integrating really well, so I'm a little surprised that he's so zealous about this. 



I wander over to his station to see what it is, and he starts pointing at his screen. I can't see anything that looks out of place in our system until a literal bug walks across his screen. 



A very funny little joke, but nothing I haven't seen before so I prepare to get on with my day. Then I realise the bug is _in_ his monitor. He takes a screenshot to prove it isn't some kind of overlay, and wipes his finger over it. 



That's a new one on me.



TL:DR; Newbie dev calls me over to look at a bug, turns out he has a friend living in his monitor.",I found a bug,0
"A few weeks ago we received a ticket about a department having trouble connecting a medical device to the software on their desktop. I can't troubleshoot the medical device (biomed department does that), but I can troubleshoot the software and hardware on the computer, so I head down to take a look.

When I walked in there were 2 users staring at the screen, just waiting. I introduce myself and they thank me for coming and start explaining how they need this to work and it's not working. They're stressed out and need this working now for a patient that will be coming soon.

I sit down and have them show me the software and the error they're getting. They show me and explain what it's supposed to do that it's not doing, then they continue to stand right behind me hovering and watching over my shoulder.

I try to ignore their hovering and see that it is a COM error. The software can't see the device at the assigned port. They have a serial cable that connects the device to a serial to USB adapter that plugs into the computer. 

So I check the settings in the software, find the port number it needs to be, and launch device management. I don't see the device under the COM port at all, so I begin checking the connections. While I'm unplugging and reconnecting each connection they're telling me how they've tried that already and it didn't help. I just nod and say I'm just going through my checklist. Everything is secure and it's not showing up, so I try moving the USB to another port as they tell me they've already tried too.

It's still not showing up, so I try removing the serial cable and plugging the medical device directly into the serial to USB adapter. Bingo. The COM port is now showing up, but is the wrong number. No problem. I change the port number, launch the software, and it works.

They cheer (softly, but I'm not exaggerating. This department is easily excitable) and begin praising me and ask what was wrong. I explain that it looks like the serial cable is bad and recommend they get a new one. We don't keep those in our stock room, but I tell them we can order one on their behalf if they need us to. They thank me, say they can take care of it and send me on my way.

I close out the ticket and move on thinking this is the end of it. But, of course it's not.

Yesterday morning I get a page for a high priority ticket from the department. I'm reading through the page and see my name specifically mentioned and one of the users from before. I open the ticket on my phone and make a note that I'm on my way. It was only 10 minutes before I normally leave, and I was already finished getting ready so I just left early. 

I get there and head straight to the department fully expecting to show up and see them trying the same thing as before. I walk in and no one is around to meet me for this ""high priority"" issue. I look at the setup and see that they are trying to use the serial cable again, but this time they're using it with a different medical device. As I'm debating calling the user she walks in and sees me.

She's explaining what it's doing and what should be happening as she logs in to the computer to show me. She hops up to let me sit down and I snag a screenshot of the error to attach to the ticket. It was a long error so I'm reading through it as she hovers and is trying to tell me what she wanted to do but she didn't want to break it so she just waited for me to get there. 

The error was saying it would take over 8 hours to transfer the logs, because there were over 1800 communication errors from the data transfer. It identifies it as an issue with the serial cable as well. I explain, again, that the serial cable is bad and that's what caused the error. I also explain that these transfer errors most likely mean that pieces of the information on the device are being lost during the transfer.

""Well, can we just click 'ok' at the bottom there and continue?"" She asks, pointing to the button at the bottom of the error.

""Sure, we can try it and see what happens."" I tell her as I click ""ok"" and see it go on to the next step instead of closing the program.

Naturally, she gets very excited and wants to keep going. I slowly follow her instructions, taking time to read each step for any errors or warnings. We get to the data transfer screen where she can select which of the recorded sessions she wants to transfer and print. We try it, and she says the graph looks right and prints it out.

""Great! Well it looks like it's working again. So.. can we just continue to click 'ok' and ignore that error?""

I stare at her for a moment processing the fact that she either forgot what I just told her about the cable or thinks it's not a big deal. ""No, I wouldn't recommend doing that. This cable is going bad and there is a chance that parts of those tests you recorded aren't getting transferred. You could be missing seconds from several parts of these tests and I don't know what effect that has on these results. I highly recommend getting in touch with biomed today to see if he can help you get a new cable for this.""

""Oh, okay then."" She sounds like she still doesn't understand why this is an issue, but asks me about the biomed guy to confirm she knows who I am talking about so she can get in touch with him.

Hopefully she actually gets it replaced this time.

Edit: There are several people mentioning cutting the cable or taking it from the department once it was found bad. In hindsight I could have taken it to biomed for them and let him know the situation, but he makes rounds through the hospital and is easy for the department to get ahold of so I didn't think to do that at the time. My department does replace other common cables/peripherals (ethernet, USB, mice, keyboards, etc) that we find to be broken or causing issues so that we do not get repeat tickets for it. Serial cables are one of the few things that we do not carry since the only thing they are used for in our environment is biomed equipment, so my go-to was to let biomed handle it since they declined letting me order a new one for them.",So... can we just keep clicking ok?,0
"A user called in stating that ""email was totally gone"", so I connected in to see that the Office upgrade we're pushing just went sideways on their machine.  I pull up Software Center and see it sitting in the Installation Status queue as failed, so I pull it up and retry it.  The usual progress wrapper we put on these kinda things pops up and I see it start churning, so now it's time to sit and wait.

After a few minutes of silence between us on the phone where I get some much needed sips of coffee in, I decide I want to get back to listening to music.

&gt;**me:** Hey, so this is probably going to take a little while, so I'll leave my remote window up and keep an eye on it in case it tanks again.  The first bit takes some time while it runs some cleanup bits to make sure all the old stuff is gone, but once that finishes up the rest is usually pretty quick.

&gt;**her:** Oh okay, sounds good.  Do you know how long it'll take?

&gt;**me:** Eh, usually about 30 or 40 minutes.  You can still work on stuff while this runs in the background, just not any Office stuff.  But yeah, I'll keep an eye on it and if I see it fail again we can just install it manually.

&gt;**her:** Sounds good!

So we hang up, I punch up my ticket, and I go back to doing whatever I was doing.  I look over and see there's an error message up on her main screen regarding Excel not starting properly.  Weird.  I hit Okay on it and wait for a few seconds.  I watch her mouse over to a different Excel document and try to open up that one.  Lo and behold, another application failed to start error comes up.  Okay, that's on me.  I didn't specify that Excel and Word are part of the Office suite.  Fair enough, so I open up my preferred method of remote, non-verbal communication in times like this, Notepad.

&gt;**me:** Hey, sorry, Excel and Word are both going to be broken until the installer finishes up.

&gt;**her:** is it okay if i go on the internet?

&gt;**me:** Yeah, that's fine.  Just keep in mind you'll have to restart at some point in the near future.

&gt;**me:** ok thanks!

I watch her pull up our homepage, navigate over to OneDrive, and get in to her files.  She digs through her stuff for a bit and then eventually finds the same sheet she was going to open previously.  I watch her click on it, mouse over to the Open button, and then immediately shatter my hope by clicking Open with Excel rather than Open with Excel Online.  She gets the same application failure she was getting previously and her mouse settles and doesn't move throughout the rest of the the install.

"Small backstory. My team at work provides telephony services to customers. This particular customer has multiple departments.

I get a ticket at the start of the week. User from Department1 is having issues with reaching Department2. Every time they call, their calls go 'straight to voicemail'. I check the logs and the routing, and find that calls are actually targetting a user in Department2 and ringing for 15 seconds before diverting to voicemail as they are going unanswered. I recheck this with User1 and they confirm that there is ringing when they call, but User2 says they get no ringing on their own end.

I follow up with User2 and gather the logs from their own phone. Sure enough, there's the call attempts coming. Based on the logs, the calls come in, trigger a pop up on the user's screen, and ring for 15 seconds before diverting to voicemail. The following conversation happens:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hey User2, we are still looking into this issue with calls not ringing on your end

User2: Hey Me, yes I don't get any ringing at all.

Me: Well, one thing I want to check. Your phone logs say you have a headset, do you?

User2: Yes I do.

Me: OK, does the sound for your phone normally go through that?

User2: Yes it does. When I am on calls, I use the headset.

Me: And you don't hear the ringing coming through the headset?

User2: Well I do sometimes. I sometimes have the headset on and a call comes in, and I can hear the ringing in them.

Me \*sometimes have the headset on, so you don't hear anything through the headset when you don't have them on?\* : Just to clarify User2, you don't wear your headset all the time?

User2: Well no, I usually have them on the charger stand behind my monitor.

Me: OK User2, it looks like all the sound for your phone comes through your headset. You can't hear the ringing, because you don't have your headphones on.

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently looking into the desktop settings and application settings (there's a PC app that controls the phone) to see if the ringing can be separated from the rest of the audio and played through the computer speakers, or the phone itself. 

TLDR: Turns out that you can't hear sound through your headphones when you aren't wearing them.",Headphones don't work when you don't wear them,0
"I work as a tech in ""higher"" education.  Dealing with Faculty on the regular can be somewhat frustrating at times, but this one was a real head-scratcher.

Last summer, we moved the Humanities department from one building to another due to a renovation.  After the reno was finished, and we moved these instructors back to their new offices.  One of them threw a ticket in claiming we ""Switched her new Compaq computer with an old Dell computer"" and provided pictures to ""prove"" it.

First of all, we stopped deploying Compaqs/HPs in 2010, when we made the jump to Windows 7 coupled with an OEM switch.  Secondly, the asset tags in both of her before and after photos matched.  

She also refuses us entry into her office if she's not there, but refuses to come in before 7:00 PM, when IT goes home at 6. We tried to point out that the computer was not swapped, pointed to the mass move spreadsheet her Dean put together for the renovation with the Asset # on it, that matched her photos.  The ONLY difference was that because her new desk was smaller, we had to lay the computer horizontally with the monitor sitting on top, rather than standing vertically next to the monitor.  She also claimed we swapped out her monitor, keyboard, and external speakers with ""old, antiquated models from the 1990's"".  Even though you can clearly see that they all matched in her B/A photos.  She ignored our email for two weeks, and we close the ticket due to no response.  This resulted in a SCATHING email asking us why we refuse to bring back her old computer, and how can we justify taking taxpayer money for our salaries.

So I get permission to work an hour OT to meet this woman and figure out WTF she's on about.  Before I left, I printed out the signout sheet she signed when we gave her the computer in 2015, with the Make/Model and Serial of the computer she had signed out.  

I get to her office, and show her that EVERYTHING MATCHES.  The asset tags in the photos, the serial numbers match with her entry in our inventory, as well as the computer sign-out sheet THAT SHE SIGNED when the computer was originally deployed to her office.  I ask her if she's missing files, or if her desktop doesn't look right when she logs in. 

NOPE. 

Apparently when we were moving 20+ faculty after-hours in one night, we also had time to export and import her profile and all her files onto this ""old"" computer.

I said ""I don't know what else to tell you.  This is the computer you had before the renovation.""   
She tells me to get out of her office and she'll ""Make do with this garbage we gave her"".

I got back to my office, document EVERYTHING. Included a few pictures I took when I was in her office on the ticket for posterity, and closed it.  Gave my boss a heads up (the woman has attempted to grieve IT in the past for self-inflicted wounds), and had a laugh over a beer later.  

A few months later, the computer in her office is due for a life-cycle upgrade. So we created a ticket asking her to start organizing her files so we can transfer them over at the time of the upgrade. We got an angry response from her saying she ""doesn't want anyone from IT near her office as we all conspired to gaslight her back in January, and continued correspondence attempts will be considered criminal harassment"". 

Kicked the ticket up to my manager, who contacted her Dean, along with copies of all her other tickets showing a complete refusal to work with IT whenever she has a problem.  The Dean was sympathetic to our plight, and told us she'd take care of it.  Got a response from the instructor a few days later saying that after speaking her Dean, she'd like to take advantage of the Technology Opt-Out program, in which the college pays her $300, tax-free, to provide and use her own equipment.  This also means she no longer will receive network resource access or printing capabilities, as we don't let non-college owned devices on the network.  **It also means we no longer have to support her.**  Additionally, if she doesn't provide the college with proof that she used that money to purchase a new computer within 3 months of receiving the funds, it's taxed as a bonus.

Everyone in my department agrees that $300 to get her to fuck off is money well spent.",$300 well spent,0

Me:  My name is Me, I'm not giving you my surname for data protection and I do know what I'm talking about. Trust me, if you remove the actual computer, the box you are referring to you won't be able to use the computer.

DM: Watch the Space! *Slams the phone down!*

*I closed the job documenting everything. A week's gone by and we get an Emergency call-out, stating that none of their computers are working. We arrived to find all the computer towers have been cut free from their cages and removed.*

Me: What happened to all the towers?

DM: I told you to watch the space, I got a professional team to remove the boxes! See it is possible!

Me: No I don't see, now you can't use the computers!

DM: What a lot of nonsense, just get the internet working so that we can use the computers again!

Me: No, what happened to the computers?

DM: Are you stupid or something? They're here! *referring to the monitors*

Me: Ok, ok what happened to the boxes?

DM: They took them to the skip

Me: Right you are telling me that you threw away leased computers which are worth £1300 each? I want to speak to your boss Now!

DM: He's in a meeting

Me: Get him now! This is very serious

DM: Ok

Me: DM threw them away and we need to get them back now as they had sensitive data on them.

DM: You mean the boxes?

" TL:DR – ICT worker tries to get work done, gets blamed for other people’s shortcut taking.

I’ve worked in my role for a little over 6 months now, I’ve been in IT for over 10 years. I’m not in a front line role (support) but as I’m the only IT rep at my site I’m often given these sorts of jobs because “it’s easier just to go to you”… I’m sure you can relate. 

It’s been a struggle trying to get my office to understand that ICT process exists for a reason and I’m not saying “no” because I’m a prick, but because it stops things from going wrong and keeps the managers happy. 

I usually fight the good fight when I get a request that doesn’t conform to process. I’ll start with a soft approach and steer them in the right direction, then escalate until process is followed. It can take days to convince them that following process is the right path to take.  

This latest instance however I’m right in the middle of upgrading our Nutanix gear and hosting hypervisor infrastructure so I really don’t have time to spend dealing with a this particularly noisy staff member. She has a temp that’s come in to fill a recently vacated position and I’m assured they will only be in the role for a week max so they want to use the ex-staff member’s account until they get a full time replacement.

“That’s not what should happen but if you can get approval from HR and your boss I guess that’s fine for a week” 

Big mistake. 

3 weeks and 2 temps later finance get wind of what going on and it blows up. 

Turns out the noisy staff member has the Temps doing her team’s expense approvals “because the temp has an accounting background”. This set off alarm bells with the CFO. Expense approvals are noisy staff member’s job and it shouldn’t be delegated without upper-management approval, which didn’t happen. 

So now I’ve got the CFO, the CIO and my manager all trying to pin blame on one another with me just sitting there trying to get my time critical upgrade done. My manager has called me four times to confirm my story (it’s all logged in our ITSM tool) because noisy staff member keeps making up crap to push the blame onto me. 

The moral of the story? Just follow process, even if it doesn’t make sense at the time.",Let me regale you with a story of a lowly ICT worker desperately trying to just do his god damn job.,0

This was way back in my high school days, my family was late to show with owning a family PC, but due to school computer labs etc, I was fairly tech savvy before I re we even got one.

Me: Me

My mother: Mom

---

A short while after the PC was set up we got ourselves a nice new DSL hookup with some abysmal speeds, but enough to do the basics.

Anyways, my mom had heard about hotmail's chat rooms and wanted to give them a go.

Now to say she's computer illiterate would be a massive understatement, but she's at least aware of that fact. And wanted to write every aspect of using the computer down in a notepad, so she could use it without having to harass me all the time. (almost unicorn level there)

So I show her hotmail, the main page is the login/create page:

Me: Do you have an account?

Mom: I don't know, do I?

Me: well have you ever used hotmail before? 

Mom: (starts shuffling though her notepad)... No

Me:  ok then, well have to make an account for you. Click create.

But she doesn't click create, she starts writing ""click create"" in her notepad.

Me, chuckling: No, mom, making an account with a page is a one time thing, you will not have to make an account with them again, so writing this down will be useless.

Mom: I just want to be sure that if you're not here that I can use this chatroom!

Me: I'm aware, but if we skip this first step in the notepad, you'll still be able to use the site if I'm not here.

Mom: I'll FEEL better if I do.

Me: fine, I'm just saying you're overcomplica-

Mom: I'm gonna write it down! (proceeds to do so)

At this point I cave, letting her write it down, knowing it's going to confuse her later. We finalize making the account and she gets into a chatroom. She's happy.

I even showed her logging out and back in. 

---

The next day I come home from school to an angry mother.

Mom: your instructions didn't work! I can't use the chatroom!

Me: what? No, we covered everything, even logging in for later.. What's it saying?

Mom: That username is already taken.

Me, laughing: I knew it! Remember that whole ""don't write that down!""? Because you wouldn't need that section again. I bet you're trying to make a duplicate account.

So she shows me exactly what she's doing.

And sure enough, she gets to the main page, clicks ""create account"" and literally fills in the exact same data as the day before, and sure enough, it won't let her make an already existing account.

I sigh. I go back to the main page, click log in, and inform her to put her info in there.

Mom: but the notepad says click create account!

Me: and I told you to not add that to the notepad! Read farther down where I show you how to login to your very real and existing account.

She huffs, logs in, and says in a very disgruntled voice: ""thank you""",No don't write that down!,0
"This happened a number of years ago, we had a contractor who would order and install (refresh) computers every 4 years for our end users. He shared this story with me before his contract ended. The refresh tech (RT) came in first thing in the morning to begin coping data from the old PC to the new PC for this User (U). He proceeds to disconnect the New PC and takes it to the users desk. He replaces the new PC with the old and has the user sign in.

U: Are you sure this is a new computer? The screen looks exactly the same.

RT: Yes, it is a brand new desktop tower. I moved all of your files over this morning.

U: Yeah, but everything on the screen is the same. It's still blurry and the icons are fuzzy.

RT: Oh, I see what you mean. I am just here to replace your Computer tower, and not the screen. Computer Screens (she had an old CRT at the time) aren't covered under the lease. Just the PC Tower.

U: What do you mean? They told me I was getting a new computer? 

RT: Well, you did get a new computer. It is right here on your desk.

U: No, I thought this was the computer! (She points to the old clunky CRT)

RT: Like I said, that is just the Monitor screen, and those are purchased outright. If you want a new one your manager will need to submit an order for one, and your local tech will install it. 

U: I...I...just can't. This is outrageous! They are just trying to kick me out of this place! (At this point she is full sniffle, starting to cry). They just want me to retire and don't give me anything new! I just cant stay here right now! (She begins to gather her things as if she were going home)

RT: (In shock that User is in full cry mode) Well, if you want I can ask your manager or see if your tech has any extra new screens laying around?

U: No, no...I just cant...this place is to much for me...I am leaving! (She proceeds to leave for the day).

Refresh tech comes back to me in shock and tells me everything, asking if he did something wrong, etc etc. I told him that group in particular is very cheap with their budget and I could give him an older flat panel screen to giver her, which he does while she isn't there, thinking this would make her happy. Well apparently not. She comes back 2 days later and finds the new screen, and is complaining that ""everything is too big"" and it is ""too bright"" I go down and turn the brightness lower and proceed to change the screen res and icon size, but she keeps just telling me that it is too big. I was thiking that the 17 inch screen was too big, but she wasn't able to explain ""what was too big"", so I eventually put a newer-older CRT screen back in and she finally seemed happy--until a month later when she decided to retire after 36 years.

"A few years ago my help desk was supporting a big client that had a dated and badly conceived IT infrastructure. I can see how y'all are surprised! /s

Big Client had recently introduced a new software to replace an older one, and a few days after the software had been rolled out we get a frantic call from the head of the department that used that software, screaming that it isn't working and to fix everything asap. After some tinkering around we realized that the server hosting the new software was offline. Mind you, we were not involved in the roll out of said software, we just knew the server's IP address and general location and the contact for that sofware's own technical support. And only because I pestered the client. But I'm digressing... let's just say that the client wasn't in a hurry to get us up to speed, as they were very disorganized.

At this point I called one of the on site techs, and after a frustrating search, he was able to locate the room the server was in and someone who could open the door to let him inside. It turned out this server was not in a proper server room, but in a regular room filled with distribution boards, network switches and other (unknown to us) servers. My coworker was eventually able to locate the server and he noticed that it was on, but there was an on screen message asking why the server had been improperly shut down. We assumed there was a blackout, fixed the problem, labeled the server with a sticker, and we went on with our day.

Except the same thing happened a week later. And the week after. At this point we suspected there was something going on that we didn't know about, like an electrical problem or something like that, so we decided to talk with the department responsible for the electricity, cables, phone network, emergency power system, etc. They swore there was nothing wrong on their side and blamed us for the server rebooting on its own. They also prevent us from checking on the server by ourselves (my on site team wanted to check the cables, test the UPS, etc). 

This went on for MONTHS and of course the department head was getting angrier by the day, as he couldn't use the software at least once a week until we physically sent a tech to reboot the server. Obviously, we IT folks were being blamed for this by everyone, from the higher ups to the department staff, everyone was going ballistic and wanted our heads on a pike. Meanwhile the Maintenance Guys were going on with their version of the events that nothing was wrong and everything worked! There were no blackouts! At a certain point, we stopped answering all the email that we were getting about this problem, as they were getting downright abusive, and we had done everything we could to troubleshoot the problem. We'd just fix the server once a week and that was it.

One day one of my techs ran into the former boss of the Maintenance department in a local café, this guy had retired a few months ago at that point. My tech mentioned the problem we were having and Former Boss went into Surprised Pikachu Face mode, explaining that they usually had a weekly test to make sure the Emergency Power System in the building was working properly. They did this early in the morning before the staff arrived to minimize disruption. Sure enough, the day after this lucky meeting, the server went down, but this time my tech had gotten on site before his usual start time and stalked the maintenance crew until they started to test the system. At that point he stepped in and demanded an explanation. The guys got very agitated and sent him away, but not before he could verify that the server was not connected to the UPS (""We did it! One of you must have disconnected it!"") and it shut down suddenly every time they tested the EPS. He was smart enough to take pictures as well!

We documented everything, compiled a huge ass email with screenshots, pictures and past emails and we sent it to all the parties involved. I'd love to end this story by saying that everyone apologized to us, but what happened instead was that maintenance quietly fixed the problem and we never heard a single word about it ever since. We were lucky enough that the server itself hadn't gotten damaged by all the sudden blackouts!

It's always the IT folks's fault, isn't it?

PS I didn't go into much detail, but the server hadn't even been tested before being installed, it turned out it was under capacity and soon we started to get phone calls because the software was too slow. It all ended a few years later when the client finally invested some money into moving their servers in a managed data center (too expensive!1!!1).",It's always IT's fault!,0

"LTLFTP, on sick leave so let's try my own tale writing (english not my mothertongue).

When I was still green, I was assigned my very first website to do on my own, the first ""for a real client with a real business"" responsibility after months of just helping my *$senpai*. The client was a single dude providing remote tech support to residential customers, basically installing Team Viewer on first visit, but the design my $boss made was cute and we have a fair share of ""old people not good with computers"" around so not a bad idea.

With my trusty _$phpCms_ and frontend skills I spend a few days on all the help pages, price &amp; services display, utmost-necessity-homepage-carousel and finally the forms. Along with your standard contact form, we had a more focused support form asking many questions about your machine and setup.

Since I was alone on this, I wasn't kept in the loop much by my project manager $pm on the deadline but I already knew not to ask questions I didn't want the answer. And I had an ace in my sleeve : _[I know jQuery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vMO3XmNXe4)_.

jQuery 1.3 was in beta and forms didn't have built-in validations, nor there was much validation and field-dependencies libraries yet, nor modules for _$phpCms_. So of course I rolled my own, we can't trust the user to know how to fill fields ?

I even started to add Ajax to my forms and quickly realized that event binding was a bit of a pain in the b*tt when your replace your entire form via your custom AJAX endpoint. Classic ""works the first time you click"" which burned the days I thought I still had before release.

Then murphy's law popped up to say Hi and I was told :

- That the homepage block redirecting to the support form should be a quick contact form only asking for name &amp; phone number to drive conversion
- That the website should be live by the end of the week. Meaning this friday.

Inserting the form as a block was non-trivial, and broke my custom AJAX, and I gave up on the idea of validating the phone number. I wasn't much of an ops guy so it was my first deployment on said friday, so I had a bit of trouble but it was live before the end of the afternoon.

I asked for validation and manual testing by $boss and $pm and we filled all forms and I checked that emails were received on our side, customer and admin notifications. We get a call from $client and I'm handed the phone :

&gt; _$client_ : Thanks for the release and hard work, $pm said he wasn't sure you could make it so I appreciate the effort.  
&gt; _$beamingPrideMe_ : thanks and no worries, you should have more and more calls when the SEO work kicks in.  
&gt; _$client_ : yeah that's why I've printed a few thousand leaflets with the website URL on it, that me and my friends &amp; family will distribute around town starting tomorrow.  

No pressure.  

It's important to note that the customer didn't want his own phone number to be advertised, since he didn't have a dedicated line for its business, this is why the quick contact form was a priority. This contact form displayed a success message that still haunts me to this day : ""__We will contact you shortly (~20min)__""

On monday I checked our email inbox set as the admin notification copy, and sure enough there was a few emails on support/contact forms so business was rolling. Since the inbox was shared for multiple site, I didn't want it to be spammed by quick contact notification so I didn't set a copy for this form.

After a few weeks $pm told me that $client was not as quick in paying as he was as requesting features before, so support request should go through him before I do anything. Funnily enough, these requests started appearing to tell us to fix a lot of things since the website didn't perform as much as expected, and since content is king and SEO what pays on the long run, we agreed on a quick few changes.

But nothing changed, maybe it was the toilet paper quality leaflets, or the design, or... and since the client was himself a techie and had a bit of free time, he started nitpicking on a few things.

If this story is a bit long and rambly, it was designed as such to give you time to to think about what could be the cause of the unexpected poor performance of the website and an insight on how things worked between the different Clue protagonists of the story. And to ask if my english is good enough for future tales.

When I was finally asked to see if there was a technical issue, I quickly realized that the quick contact submission were nowhere to be found in the backend. Other forms were fine, but this one was empty, maybe the client deleted them after use to know who he had already contacted ? While I was emitting this suggestion to $pm, his face went white :

&gt; _$pm_ : What if the form doesn't work ?

Now if you have used jQuery and the $.ajax method, you know that you can setup some callbacks to handle what happens on form submit. Namely `success` and `error` but also `complete` which triggers in every case.  
Can you guess which one I used ?  
And which URL had to be hardcoded since the form was not the current page displayed ?  
Can you guess what happened to this URL during deployment on a different subdomain ?  

Sure enough, the browser console displayed a clean 404 error on the form action. In a cold sweat I opened my JS file and checked the `complete` callback I used and the _$phpCms_ code I did. Turns out my custom check was far from enough and only `success` and `error` callbacks automatically checks for 200 vs 3XX/4XX/5XX error before executing your own code. 

We were displaying ""__We will contact you shortly__"" while never sending your phone number to anybody, for weeks now. Like any catastrophe, it was a pile of mistake on everyone parts on top of my technical mishap : both us and the customer could have checked the form submission on the backend, both us and our prone-to-criticize-our-choice-of-HTML-tags-client could have opened the console or the source code to see the incorrect URL on the homepage, the $pm/client/dev process, absence of _$senpai_ oversight... but that was a long time ago so the post mortem is no longer necessary.

What was necessary at the time was deciding on the fix and what to tell the client. I felt my own employment was in the balance too, so I was less picky on bullshitting our way out. In the end we told the client we found the issue and what it was, and didn't charge for all the subsequent support request. But it wasn't long before he took everything in his own hands since he oddly still had free time, and the website is still live to this day but with a phone number to call and without any forms.

Tl;Dr : quick contact form aka main conversion endpoint was sending clients to the shadow realm

"Dave and I worked at a Helpdesk in the 90's. For reasons lost to time, I found myself in the car with him at the end of the day going home.

Dave was dropping by a client on the way to fix something that was broken. Not sure what the circumstances were exactly, but I stayed in the car and he went in to see what was up.

Comes back a couple of minutes later with a big grin on his face and tells me what happened.

Dave explains to the client that there is a minimum call-out fee of $100. Client agrees.

The client needs to have some setting fixed, something about a printer if memory serves me, so Dave opens up the Windows Control Panel, dives in 17 clicks later, problem fixed.

Dave says: ""All done, that will be $100 please.""

Client is unhappy that this little clicking exercise would cost $100 and says: ""I'm not paying for that.""

Dave says: ""No problem"", reopens the Windows Control Panel, 17 more clicks, problem un-fixed.

"...poorly thought-out requirements.

I'm a developer for a small digital agency. Too small to have separate teams for development and front-line support.

I'm working, at the moment, on a mixture of support and the latest new feature for the site we've built and maintain for one of our clients. It's a rather specialised eCommerce site. A while ago we built a click and collect feature into the site to integrate with the client's network of physical stores - before that all online orders had been delivered to the customer.

Our original client contact, whose name is not Tom, left the company shortly after we did the development for that feature. He was great. He wasn't very technical, but he was computer-literate enough to use the system we built, he knew the business domain thoroughly, and he *knew* that he wasn't very technical and he *trusted* us. He also knew how to submit a decent bug report.

We miss !Tom, although his replacement, who is not called Sam, is not bad.

So today !Sam submitted an urgent bug report. A customer had requested, and the request was to be granted. It was a click and collect order, which had been sent out to the store for collection, and I don't know why they were getting a refund, but, !Sam said, it wasn't possible to refund the order.

My project manager assigned me the ticket, I jumped on the test environment, and had absolutely no difficulty in replicating the issue. The button to refund simply wasn't there for click and collect orders.

So, I went into the code. It was just as easy to see why the button was missing: `if !clickAndCollect`. Intentional beyond reasonable doubt. There was a ""cancel"" button instead, specific to click and collect, which would only update the order's status and not touch the card transaction. (For a bonus, this button is in two places, and only one of them was actually hooked up to the server-side function.) But what to say to !Sam?

I dug out the old spec for the click and collect feature and trawled through it. I'd not had any part in the building of this feature: it was mainly done by a dev who's name is not Ken, and I'd not really had occasion to look into how it worked until now.

Jackpot! There was a note in the spec, to the effect that a specific requirement had come direct from !Tom that click and collect orders should not be able to be refunded through the site's back end. They would be returned to the head office if the customer didn't show up to collect them within a stated time-frame, and if that was the case they needed to be cancelled *without* automatically refunding the customer the money, so that the client could get in touch with the customer and find out whether they still wanted it, without having to take payment again if they did.

So the urgent bug is not a bug, it's a feature, except it is a bug because *that's silly*. Of course there's going to be reasons why click and collect customers can ask for and receive refunds. What we need is a cancel button *as well as* a refund button.

My project manager signed off on my proposal with ""Oh yeah, I forgot that was intentional.""

I had the fix checked in (*and* fixed the broken button without the client even noticing it) within three hours of the bug being reported, and an hour and a half of that was a meeting and my lunch break. It's on the test environment and will be released tomorrow if only we can induce !Sam to test and approve it by lunchtime, which I reckon is pretty prompt service. But if I'd been dev on that feature, I'm pretty sure I'd have suggested it at the time. (And not forgotten to make that button actually do something. Project manager: ""I'm happy for you not to mention it to !Sam but you can shout at !Ken about it if you want."" I didn't.)",Look! Up on Production! It's a bug! It's a feature! It's...,0

"This just happened and I just need to vent so sorry not sorry you're my victims.

A user calls in, saying that they have a package that their system is asking them to send to another site. That other site can't handle that type of parcel according to them, so something is wrong in the system.

Naturally, I check my system, and it says this other site does handle this type of package. Naturally, the user says no sites of that type handles that type of package.

The conversation gets more and more heated as the user gets pissed off and I try to deescalate, offering up a whole host of people that can help them with how the process works. After all, if the system says that site handles that type of package, it does, right?

I end up ending the call after getting their contact information because they're adamant that they're right and I'm wrong. I call around, talk to various people, who all agree with me that that site definitely handles that type of parcel. Finally, I get to the big boss of that entire flow, and ask her. She says that no sites of that type handle that parcel. I ask why the system says they do, which she finds weird and starts investigating. Then I get this gem.

""Oh yeah! I forgot. That flag wasn't in use anymore so we just changed it to mean this entirely different thing, but we didn't change the name.""

After a bit of silence, I reply. ""So you mean that when all systems explicitly say this thing, it actually means this entirely different thing?""

"This happened back in the late 90's I was hired to work as a programmer for a fairly small company. Since they were so small my 'office' was a corner of the network center. we had 4 or 5 PCs all networked to handle the basic server needs. 

After I had been there a few months, they hired a new network admin to assist the network manager. Since my 'office' was in that room I got to witness her doing MANY things that made no sense if she actually knew anything about networks. 

The first thing I saw her do that let me know she didn't know much about networks was whenever she had to move a file from one server to another she used Sneaker net. (That was the process of putting a file on one or more floppies and walking to the other machine and copying it.)

I tried to tell her that she could just map the server as an additional drive, but she told me I was just a programmer and didn't understand the complexities of networking. (I had triple majored in CIS at college, CIS Programming, CIS system Analysis, and CIS Networking. So I actually did know a bit about Networking.)

One day on my machine, I mapped the drives to all the servers as drives. The next time she started copying files to a floppy I casually struck up a conversation and found out what files she was moving to another server. I quickly opened my mapped drives and copied before she was half way across the room. 

When she tried to copy the file from the floppy, it asked if she wanted to replace the one that was already there. She asked herself aloud how that file got there and went back to her desk and went back to work. 

I just shook my head and let her keep using sneaker net if that is what she preferred.",How did that file get to the other server?,0
"Earlier this year we enacted some new security policies on a client that was seriously out of date. They had a breach, we cleaned up, and moved forward. 

We are now at the first password expiration date and my life is falling apart. I warned them mid-month this was happening, and explained the process for logging in to change a password on Windows. I was immediately met with backlash about how this was a waste of time for their employees, they couldn't possibly adjust the daily schedule for this, etc etc. 

I tried politely to explain, and I was met with them asking me to manually change the passwords for the entire company through AD, as well as changing the passwords for their internal billing and records systems. The precedent was that I did it during the infection (something I considered needed at the time, and a one-off ticket due to the breach) so I must be able to do it now. 

I took it to my superiors internally at our MSP, who then had a phone interaction with the client, and came back telling me that we would be doing the password resets manually four times per year this way, going forward.

The reset date is October 1st, they all waited till today to get back to me with their ""decision"", it is expected to be done within a window of ONLY SUNDAY because this client can't possibly make a concession in ANY WAY to assist with this.

"I get the call, and $user tells me about a separate ticket that has already been processed and that the problem is still not solved. (This happens sometimes, but normally people wait the recommended amount of time, three days)

This past ticket happened 20mins ago from another tech that is more tenured &amp; experienced than me.. I look at the documentation, it's perfect. The tech troubleshooted the issue, and escalated it to a field tech.

I tell the $user everything I find, and try my best to empathize with her situation. I then go on to tell her that she will need to wait at least three days before getting back with me again because this issue is not mission critical &amp; and the field tech has not made it to the location. She goes crazy and starts saying that the last tech didn't know what she was talking about and that the location she is at is a ""flagship"" (At my company we have a list of acronyms and terminology, and this is not one of those.. so flagship means nothing to me) so I go on to tell her that I'll transfer her to a tier 2 tech so that they can better explain the situation.

"Gonna try to keep this brief.

So we have a web app for our users that handles email, address book, notes, calendar, tickets etc. This app is used daily by all of our employees.

The $user in this case is a new employee that only started working here 2 weeks ago. She is not new to computers and she gets used to our web app rather quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Today $user makes a ticket that she gets randomly disconnected from the web app and I claim the ticket.

I start with normal debugging, starting with checking if it's a network problem. Her computer is fine, no dropped packets, other websites are fine.

I instruct her to use for a few hours the app in another browser. Same issue.

$user gets back to me that the issue persists. Randomly disconnect from web app and presented with login screen.

I have tested her account thoroughly and nothing stands out whatsoever.

Next step I decide to make her another account and transfer her data over.

I give her the new password and after 1h I get a ticket reply:

$user: Problem still here.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am baffled, what could be the problem. The user is alright, logs are normal, no network issues, not a problem with the browser, there are no keyboard shortcuts that she might press to log herself out.

I decide to give her a spare PC.

$user responds in tichet after a few hours: Problem still here.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now stunned, the problem is making my head itch. I ask a colleague if he can take a look at this problem but after a few hours he is as clueless as I am.

For some reason I say to myself that the user might be at fault.

I grab a muffin and a cup of coffee, I get a chair and I tell the user that I will be monitoring her for a few hours to see if there's something wrong with her user, her pc or with how she operates them.

Long and behold, after only 20 minutes, I see the issue.

I must gather my thoughts for a few seconds that seem like an eternity because what I could not believe what I saw.

&amp;#x200B;

The mistery why she was getting disconnected:

Whenever she opened an email that she had to read in detail, she would maximize the email window. After she was done with the email, she pressed the ""X"" in the top right corner. Nothing wrong here. Only she wasn't pressing it normally, she would double click the bloody button.

The logout button in our app is in the top right corner, right under the close button from the maximized email window. Whenever she was closing a maximized email window she would double click and the 2nd click was logging her out.

I instructed her to single click it from now on.",The mistery,0

"Background: We're a small company providing IT service mainly for other small companies. A lot of regular customers but also quite a few new faces every now and then.

In today's tale I was sent to a new customer (boss of his company) who called us because he couldn't access his files anymore.

On site I let him show me how he usually accessed his files: By clicking on a network share that obviously wasn't reachable.

Me: ""Okay sir, it looks the server you get your files from isn't reachable so I should have a look at it. Where is your server?""

He: ""There is no server. Just my computer. I have nothing else.""

Me: ""Well that can't really be... you're trying to access a share on another machine in your local network. So if you accessed your files this way until yesterday there *has to be* some kind of server here. It could also be another computer like yours or may be a so called NAS. That would be a box about this size \*gesticulating\* then. But something must be somewhere here.""

He: ""Listen, we used to have a server, but we don't have it anymore. ""

Me: ""You used to have a server until *yesterday*, or what do you mean?""

He: ""No, no, my company used to be bigger. I had five employees in this offices. But we had to resize. The last employee left six years ago. At this time the whole complicated IT stuff was thrown out. Now it's just my computer. Nothing else.""

Me: ""Can we take a look around then? There *must* be something! Probably some small NAS in a cabinet or something""

&amp;#x200B;

After this discussion he showed me the whole floor... obviously he still rented six rooms even if he was the only one left working there. So most of the floor seemed deserted.

As you can imagine we ended up finding his server. It was actually quite big and silently stood in the corner of one of the rooms. Behind the door, so that you actually couldn't see it when you entered and left the door open.

It turned out that the plugbar the server was connected to died (yes... really). When I plugged it into another outlet it booted and a few minutes later the network share was accessible again.

It was a Windows Server 2003 that obviously continued to work reliably for at least six years *after* the last person who knew that it existed left the company... 

The guy was very surprised and told me that he had never seen this server before and that he can't comprehend how this thing could have sat there for so many years without him ever noticing it. (I was wondering too because the thing made some noticeable fan noise...)

Since the server was doing nothing else than provide the guy with a few hundred megabytes of files we shut it down after we copied the files to his local harddrive (and setting up a backup there).

The customer then hired us to look through his regular IT expenses in case there is something else he doesn't know about.

Well... there was... it turned out that he paid about 150$ per month for hosted exchange mailboxes that nobody had been using for years (plus a ton of other hosting stuff that he didn't need) . He also still had a PBX and paid about five phone lines etc. I think we saved him several thousand bucks a year just by cancelling useless subscriptions that he kept paying and paying. This was about two or three years ago. In the meantine he acquired a taste for saving money and actually moved into his office floor.

"So I finally have a story that isn't too depressing to put on here. First a little background, I am field tech for a little Mom and Pop operation. I take care of everything from networking, to computer hardware. We mostly deal with small businesses, but occasionally I get stuck with a residential.

So it was like any other Wednesday morning, I woke up and checked my tickets. Saw that a residential had been assigned to my schedule, and looked at the notes. Saw that the customer was providing the parts, she just needed us to set it up for her. I sighed and bitched to myself before heading onsite.

Wednesday day morning I show up about a half hour early, I ring the customers doorbell... no answer. So I go and sit in the car, thinking maybe the customer wasnt home yet. When it was time for the schedule appointment I went and rang the door bell again. I got no response, so I decided to call the number on the ticket.

Divinechaos91: Hi, this is Divinechaos91with Mom and Pop Tech. I have you on schedule, and I was just seeing if you were available.

Customer: *angrly* I've been waiting for you! I'll come to the door to let you in.

I hang up the phone with her, and before she can come to the door, I get a call from the office. Apparently the customer, had called and complained that I was not there on time. Even though I had been waiting for her in my car to let me in. I explain what happened to the office, shrug it off before the customer comes to the door.

The customer brings me up to her daughters room, and tells me she needs this printer setup, that was brand new in the box.

Customer: So I want this setup to the wifi so everyone can print off of.

Divinechaos91: As long as the printer has the capability it shouldn't be a problem. Should only take me a little bit.

I start opening the box and the printer and find that its USB only. I apologize to the customer, and explain that it wouldn't be possible and it would have to print only from her daughters laptop when it was plugged in. She sighs, and tells me fine. It was about this time I started to realize this was a cheaper printer. I set everything up and find the printer didn't come with a USB cable.

Divinechaos91: Sorry, Customer it didnt come with a cable. Do you happen to have one?

Customer: *visibly upset* Well dont you have a USB cable for it?!?!?! You're suppose to be the tech.

I apologized, explained that my notes said she had told the office that she would provide the parts. She got upset and criticized me for not being prepared. I apologized again, I told her that our office was about 10 mins down the road, and I'd be right back. So after driving back to the office to get the USB cable, I went back and tested her printer... 

This where things start to get worse, and realize that the customer doesnt have a basic understanding of how any of this works. I setup the printer on her daughters laptop, I go to print out a test page and ask for some paper. She hands me an already used paper. That had appeared to come from her daughters school, already printed on one side. I shrugged and said it should be fine for a quick test print. I run the test page, and find the ink to be extremely faded. I ask her for another page, and run it again. I do this a few more times.

Divinechaos91: So it looks like the ink cartridges have dried up. How long have you had the printer?

Customer: 3 years

Divinechaos91 *shocked pichaku face* ( I cant for the life of me figure out why anyone be paying this kind of money for an old printer.)

Customer: why is that a problem?

I show her the test pages, and explain what is happening. I tell her I believe that her ink cartridges have dried up. Shes takes a shot at me asking if I was guessing or if I knew what I was talking about. I ignore her and check the price of ink cartridges. Shocker its ridiculous amount of money. I explain she would be better off buying a new printer with the features she wanted. That it would be cheaper than  replacing the ink cartridges. I help her pick out a 50 dollar hp all in one printer. 

Customer: Can your company order it for me, and can you come back out onsite to set it up?

Divinechaos91: *internally* ohhhh god why? ""Yes of course let me go ahead and get that ordered for you.

Customer: okay I'll make sure I get some printer paper before you come back.

Friday comes the customer is back on my schedule, the printer had come in everything seemed fine. I headed back onsite and this time just called her immediately instead of ringing her doorbell. She comes to the door.

Customer: ohhh I forgot to get printer paper, we can use some of the old paper to test it, after you set it up?

Divinechaos91: *internally* Why do I even try? "" Yes M'am that should be fine, just get some new paper as soon as you can.

So we do the same thing again, but this time it seems go a little smoother because it's the right kind of printer. I get it setup on the wifi, and setup AirPrint. We test again with her old used paper, it's looking a little wrinkly, but does okay. I explain to her that because we are only using one page, the printer is throwing a fit. So you have to hit the print button on the printer to get it to resume, but it should be fine after you put more than one page in it. We test all her apple devices, and laptop. She thanks me and I'm on my way.

This should be where this damn story ends. But fast forward to Monday, and I see her name pop back up on my schedule. I head back to her place, and shes all pissed off saying I sold her a lemon and going on and on. I apologize for the inconvenience and ask to look at it. 

She brings me back to the printer, and I see that it is asking for more paper...

Divinechaos91: hey do you happen to have anymore paper?

Customer: proceeds to hand me more of her daughters wrinkled worksheets.

The new printer has had enough of this shit,( and really so have I). And starts jamming and ripping the paper. I explain to the customer what's going on and she gets made that I sold her a cheap jamming printer... I smile and go I believe it's the paper. She continues to complain saying I'm a con man and I dont know what im doing. I smile and tell her I'll be right back. I am going to the office to grab a package of paper. 


I get back to the office and rant about residential customers, and head back to the customers with a full stack of paper. I clear the print jobs, fill the printer. I test print, and have the customer test. She appears to be happy with the product, I end up selling her the package of paper so she doesnt have to go to the store. I smile and shake her hand and head off to my next appointment.

So this my tale of the over $500 cheap printer install, sorry it was so long but I needed to rant on this one.

TLDR
Customer puts bad gas in their car and gets made that it keeps stalling.

"First post here, so yeah . . .

I work at a computer repair counter at a retailer. This girl comes up with a large semi- custom tower. She tells me that it was working, then she went away for several weeks, and when she came back, the fans would spin, but it wouldn't Display. Alright.

So we test it with her, and it does exactly like she said. I ask her if I can take in the back for some quick trouble shooting and she agrees. (Didn't want to open the case in front of the customer)

Open it up planning to reseat the GPU and RAM. Then I notice the ram is not actually in all the way, so I go to pull it out, only to realize THE DAMN RAM WAS BACKWARDS. So obviously someone had already taken the RAM out once since the last time it was working.

Reseat the RAM nothing. Swap with known good RAM, nothing. Even swap with a test GPU just in case, but nothing seams to fix it. (Old AM3+ motherboard so we didn't have parts to see if it was just the mobo, or mobo and  CPU)

So I bring it out to the client and explain the situation, the conversation went something like:

Me: So, it looks like the RAM was not seated correctly when it was brought in, and because of that, both the RAM and motherboard have failed.

Client: alright, what can we do to fix it?

Me: well unfortunately, we don't sell the kind of motherboard you need, due to the fact that they stoped producing those a few years ago. 

Client: well, what are you gonna do to fix this?

Me: there's not a whole lot we can do, but if you contact the manufacturer . . .

Client: No this worked before. And now that I brought it in, your telling me its broken, so obviously something happened. What are you going to do to make this right?

Me: (baffled) But . . . You brought this in to is because there was an issue, right?

Delusional Client: Yeah, but now your telling me it's broken, and It worked before. So what are you going to do?

She swore up and down that there was  no one who could have opened it up, and flipped the RAM.

I ended up giving her to my manager who I think ultimately ended up exchanging her PC.

"I just got off the phone with a user.  She's a sweet lady and one of those people who you like, but you don't like their tickets.

She was complaining her scan jobs weren't showing up.  The printer scans to a network share so I took a look and the jobs weren't there.   I told her to reboot her scanner and try again and just as I hung up the PDFs showed up on the network share. (There's no way she ran across to the other side of the floor and rebooted the scanner BTW).

I called her to let her know and she told me she was rebooting her PC and that's what fixed it. I tried to explain that her computer isn't involved in this in any way but she didn't want to believe me.  I told her that all rebooting her laptop does is buy time while the scanner is OCRing the job etc.

I got off the phone with her but I still don' think she believes me!

A few weeks ago I updated my work laptop to Windows 10 version 1903, to start testing it and its relevant updates before we go hospital wide with it. Since then I have gotten an error every morning when i start my computer ""A Conexant audio device could not be found"". I never thought anything of it since my headset still worked and I had never had an issue with sound. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well this morning I tried to play a voicemail (for comical reasons) for my Boss to listen to and when I unplugged my headset I had no audio. I started with the standard stuff, making sure nothing was disabled in the device manager, driver updates, bios updates, Google searching laptop make and model for potential known issues, I had no luck with anything. Since the HP driver took so long to download it was the last thing I tried and it finally gave me a clue as to what was wrong. the driver failed and said it couldn't find a device to match the driver. at this point i go back to the device manager and realize that I don't have any sound or audio devices listed, at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where my brain actually started working. I plug in my headset and immediately I have audio devices in the device manager again. some of you may know what happens next, but i felt like such a ""USER"" it took me over an hour to find it. 

So I restart the laptop and go into the bios, I navigate to the built in devices page, and find to my utter amazement that my on board audio had somehow been disabled. I don't know if it was a side effect of the Windows 10 upgrade, one of my many bios updates, or just me not paying attention while making personal preference changes (i hate having fast boot enabled).

"So this happened about a month ago, and was ongoing for several weeks. I was telling my GF this story and she told me I should post it here.

Obligatory context: I work helpdesk at a medium sized bank with several locations, with a total of about 200 employees, so we get a ton of calls/order requests.

$User: I'll just get someone here to show me. I'll call you back.

$Me: Okay? There's not really- \*click\*

So I'm sitting there like, A) She really just hung up on me. B) There's NO reason to call us back unless it's not working. 5 minutes later, we get the 2nd call:

$Me: Helpdesk this is $Me

$User: Hi so it's plugged in now but there's a ton of words on the screen.

$Me: Okay, so it's probably just syncing to the $Software server. (I had already enabled her computer for use on the server, all she had to do was plug in the PIN pad and the server would recognize the computer's PIN Pad.)

$User: So how long will that take?

$Me: Tbh it's probably already done

$User: There's still words on the screen

$Me: Have you tried to see if it will work?

$User: No.

$Me: Okay, well give it a try, and if it doesn't work, give us a call back and we'll troubleshoot it.

We don't hear from $User for about 2-3 days, and I think, okay she's figured out how ridiculously easy it is to use these things. Not one, NOT ONE, person in the entire bank, out of all employees, has had problems with their PIN pads. (And if you work helpdesk you know it's rare for a device to just...work). Then we get the 3rd call:

$Me: (Obligatory Greeting)

$User: This PIN pad isn't working right.

$Me: What's wrong with it? Can you describe it?

$User: It's just a blank screen now.

(At this point, all of us in IT look at each other like Jim from the Office) $Me: It's supposed to look like that.

$User: But NO ONE ELSES looks like that.

$Me: Does it work?

$User: Idk

$Me: Well try it.

(She tries it) $User: It works

$Me: Okay well then there's not much we can do if it's already working.

So this time, a full week goes by before we hear from $User again. I've completely forgotten about her PIN pad by this point until I answer the phone:

$Me: (Obligatory Greeting)

$User: Okay, so the PIN pad has words all over it now!

$Me: What?

$User: You guys said that it was supposed to be blank, but now there's words!

$Me: Does it work?

$User: I mean...yes...

$Me: THEN IT'S FINE.

$User: But you guys said it was supposed to be blank!!!!

$Me: It's probably just syncing to the server, it does that every once in awhile. If it works, it works. There's nothing else we can do.

This was about a month ago at this point, haven't heard anything about the PIN pad since then. I mean, I'm going to be honest, we can't even troubleshoot PIN pads, because they JUST WORK. There is NEVER problems with them because they are SUPER simple. Problems with $Software server that uses them? Sure, ton with that. The PIN pads themselves? NEVER. So 4 calls about the same, BRAND NEW PIN pad was probably the worst case of ""helpless user"" I've ever had.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR User calls 4 times about a PIN pad that's plug n play and works fine because it doesn't look like how she thinks it's supposed to look","""But it's not like everyone elses!""",0

"Hi all, FTP, so sorry about formatting and if this storytelling is a bit lacking please leave your suggestions! Thanks!

When I first started out in IT, I was part of a small IT team supporting a campus of about 5 manufacturing facilities. The company that owned these facilities had a talent for spending as little as possible on redundancy and rejecting our budget requests with the response, ""Just make it work."" This ensuing incident and a few more in short succession changed their minds and actually led to a better understanding of the importance of redundancy and our IT team.

Anyway, down to the story. Its a warm August day, my boss and I were working on a weekend to upgrade a few computers on the manufacturing floor and installing some more security cameras (scope creep on a project that lasted 2 years and could be an entire new story). We walk in the server room after completing that work because it was the coldest room in the building :). We decide to check on the cameras from the server while we are there and as I go to wake up the monitor, we hear a loud BANG from the direction of the main server rack. Just then the entire network goes down. 

When we take a look in the rack, we see the top of the UPS is not flat anymore, no it looks like a dome. As you might have guessed, the company wanted to squeeze as much life out of the batteries as they could, and also didn't have a backup UPS or batteries. We  call the CIO and he decides the best course of action is to call our vendor. When we called our vendor they they said 1 thing that left me utterly bewildered. They advised us to run the core of our network and our servers off of surge protectors, until they could get there on Monday. 

After the call with our vendor, my boss called the CIO to confirm these directions and do a little CYA if this blew up in our faces. And this is how we ended up running our entire core IT infrastructure off of surge protectors for a month, until my boss finally gave up on our vendor and ordered a UPS directly, plus a backup.

As I mentioned at the start, this incident and a couple of incidents involving unplugged surge protectors (oops!) actually caused the company to invest in redundancy and backup hardware for company critical devices. So I guess something good came of it? They still kept and to this day use that vendor though, old  friend of the CIO and all.","As the UPS goes, so goes the Network",0
"I work as a phone repair technician inside of a phone retail store. 

So this lady came in today with an older iPhone, and she wanted to switch over her data to her new iPhone 11. (we've done maybe 50 of these transfers in the last couple days,  it's a small part of what we usually do apart from repairs) This is business as usual, but she tells us that she's been in before and we know there must be something deeper going on making it difficult to transfer. She tells us her daughter had trouble with it and so did one of our coworkers who helped her yesterday. 

So we try 2 or 3 normal methods to transfer her data and nothing is working. Eventually we conclude it's because her storage is full. It won't allow cloud backup or installation of any transfer apps because it's so full. So we work with her to try to find something she can delete. 

Problem is her phone doesn't have any apps that are deletable. Only the default ones. Her looking at her storage reveals that it's all just photos. 

She was super specific she did not want to delete any of her photos because she had family that had passed away and they were very important to her so we didn't want to pry. We try very hard not to snoop peoples personal info and photo galleries but after an hour of trying to work around it, curiosity got the better of me.

She really did have a lot of photos. 28000+ to be specific. I clicked into one of the albums and I was astonished to find it was not photos of her grandchildren at all. The photos were almost entirely product images of jewelry. She saved so many that I was astonished. I looked over at my coworker and scrolled. And then I scrolled faster. And then I scrolled as fast as I could. Yep she had 28000 pictures of FUCKING JEWELRY. There were a few normal pictures scattered about sure, but the vast majority were JEWELRY! 

My coworker looked for another moment stunned. I started laughing. I couldn't contain it, I walked into the back and laughed harder. I was hysterical. We both were. We had to keep quiet because she was still standing at the desk on the other side of the door. It took a good 5 minutes before I was able to face the customer without cracking up.

""Maybe you could take a look at the photos and see if there's anything you can delete?"" As I handed the phone back to her. ""Just as much as you can, maybe that will free up enough space to work with.""

She comes back up to the desk 10 minutes later after deleting 30 photos. What... I imagine she probably went through and was like ""well I'm keeping the jewelry, might as well delete some of my least favorite grandkid""

Obviously 30 photos was not enough space. So we ended up telling her that she would need to delete probably another 100 or so before it would allow it to back up. So she decided to leave and come back later. She didn't even acknowledge the jewelry photos.

This whole interaction was so weird and insane that I am still laughing and scratching my head. What the hell?

"Several years ago (Actually over 20 years ago!) I was running IT support for the London office of a 24-hour working international company.  Each office had their own tech support, with a central help desk in the US.  One night, at about 2am, I got a phone call. It was the New York office.  None of their fax machines worked.  The conversation went something like this:

Me: you realise you’ve rung me in London, and it’s 2am. I was asleep.

User: but we can’t fax from here. We need someone to fix the fax machines

Me; I can’t help you.  I support the London office, and I don’t know anything about New York and I’m not paid to be on call and you have your own IT support

User: But I called you because our fax machines don’t work.  Stop putting stuff in the way and get our fax machines fixed NOW!

Me: I’m 3000 miles away.  I don’t know your setup, and it’s so totally not in my remit i don’t know what to say.  It’s like calling a plumber in California for you.  I cannot help. 

User: if you don’t come and help me I’m going to get you fired! Do you know how serious this is?

Me; FUCK OFF!

The next day I rang his manager and was told that the guy in question had been disciplined, and got a full and frank apology from the divisional director for the whole affair, after I made a complaint. I also claimed an hours overtime.","Yes, I’ll just book a transatlantic flight to plug your fax machine in",0
"Background: I work at the technology service desk for a medium-sized state university. We recently transitioned away from the dumpster-fire that is blackboard, which is a third-party service that professors can use to post documents, assignments, and activities, and students can turn in assignments, get grades, submit the occasional form, etc. The replacement is Canvas, which is a third-party service that professors can use to post documents, assignments, and activities, and students can turn in assignments, get grades, submit the occasional form, *but with a cleaner interface*.

The transition was known to faculty and staff about a year-and-a-half to two years ahead of time. About 6 months out, the announcements and reminders became more constant, faculty were sent regular notices that if they needed *anything* that was saved on blackboard to also be on canvas, they would need to download all their documents and media prior to the Blackboard shutoff date in June. After that date, Blackboard will no longer be in service at $University, and any content (syllabuses, assignments, quizzes, etc) would be gone with it.

Come May 30, we start getting calls.

SD: Me/Service Desk

User: Lord Admiral Doctor Professor Ignoramus III, PhD, DFA, MD, MBA, Esq. *who definitely knows how to read*.

&amp;#x200B;

User: So I just got this notice that Blackboard is going away, do you know when that is?

SD: Oh yea, we've been making announcements for \~2 years now. It's going away next week.

User: Well, this is the first I've heard of it. What about all my stuff on there?

SD: That notice you said you got, are you referring to the email that was sent out yesterday?

User: Yes, of course!

SD: Well, per that email, you need to pull whatever it is that you want to save from blackboard so that you can re-upload to Canvas when it goes live.

User: Well, this is the first I've heard of it!! Why wasn't anyone told?!

SD: Do you have your inbox open? Do a quick search for the word Blackboard.

User *types loudly, audibly hunting and pecking for keys:* Well, I've never seen any of these emails before!

SD: But you did receive them. There were also notices on the website as well.

In the end, the deadline was extended for a month because for some reason *literally every professor* ***who totally knows how to read*** *was at an important academic conference and therefore was unable to pull their stuff from blackboard.*

After a couple of weeks of these calls leading up to the extension, things died down. After dealing with the late-90's/early 2000's UX barf that was Blackboard, most people quite liked the cleaner, better organized UI for Canvas, even if professors decided to skip training sessions then complain when they forgot to hit 'publish' and students couldn't access unpublished content.

Then, last week, I had the pleasure of taking this call:

SD: $University Technology Service Desk, how may I help you?

User: Yes, this is $name+2\_Titles\_That\_mean\_*nothing*. Is blackboard gone?!

SD: Yes, we transitioned away from Blackboard about 3 months ago. Canvas went live around that time.

User: So, last semester, I uploaded lesson plans, syllabi, study guides, and other documents to Blackboard.

SD: Uh huh...

User: So why isn't it on Canvas?

SD: Did you upload anything to Canvas?

User: No, it's on Blackboard! You guys were going to move everything for us!

SD: The deadline for pulling your content from Blackboard was in early June, then they extended it a month to give everyone more time to grab what they needed.

User: So, *I* was supposed to download my things and upload them to the new system?

SD: Yes.

User: *Somehow audibly silently raging*

SD: I can transfer you to the Blackboard/Canvas support team if you like..

User: Yes.

"So, a little backstory.  This was in '96-'97, and I had been working with this IT services company for only a few months.  We had two customers with large HP 9000 Unix mainframes, I remember at least one of them was about 5 feet tall.  In the back of those enclosures, you could swing open the door and mount rack equipment alongside expansion modules for the mainframe itself.  One of those customers used that space to store network switches and hubs in the rack section, and it was common for us to go into the back of those servers and make changes to network topology, service networking equipment, etc, while the server was still busy humming away.

We had other customers that had TI 1500 Unix servers.  The way these servers were described to me at the time was, quite literally, the ""little brother"" to the bigger HP 9000s.  The enclosures of the TIs looked nearly identical to the HPs, along with the back door that swung open and gave access to the expansion modules, only on a much smaller scale (and unable to store rack equipment like its big brother).

Now, I was not a Unix guy.  By this point, I had dabbled a bit with Linux, but was hired primarily for my knowledge of Windows desktop and NT, Novell, and various LAN and WAN technologies.  We also had Unix specialists on staff, and nearly every one of the companies we had contracts with had their own staff, as well, to take care of these machines.  Suffice it to say, I knew little to nothing on these machines themselves, as I was in the world of Pentium, Pentium Pro, Cyrix, and AMD.  Now, on to the day in question.

One of our clients was a county government agency.  This was a fairly large county, so there was a lot of IT infrastructure involved with their operation.  At this time, they were a Novell network on the PC side and were just introducing Windows NT machines into their server infrastructure, but they also utilized a single TI 1500 that served their main application via green screen terminals (either terminals themselves or via terminal emulation on PC).  We had just done some major changes to their network by deploying some new Windows NT servers and some new switches, and the owner of my company wanted us to go through the server room and the equipment closets and confirm and update our maps of the connections.  As an added bonus, he wanted us to tag the ends of cables with labels that said where that cable was plugged into at the other end.

So, I get there early one morning with a co-worker and set about doing just that.  We started with the equipment closet farthest away from the main server room and began working our way towards the center of their IT universe.  We get nearly all the way through the main server room, and are left with several cables going into the back of the TI 1500 enclosure.  So, we do what we've always done, pop open the back enclosure door and start tracing the network cables leading into the back of it.

We're about halfway done when the IT manager rushed into the room saying that all of the agency locations have crashed.  He walks up to the main terminal, and it's dead.  Passed on.  Ceased to be.  This is an ex-terminal.  He asked what we had been doing before it crashed.  So, we told him.

Turns out, the TI 1500 has a kill switch that shuts off power when you open the enclosure.  So, as we opened the back to map out those connections, we also managed to kill the power to the server and shut down the entire organization in the middle of the workday.  When he asked why we did that even after reading the warning, I said something to the effect of ""Warning?""

There, on the back door of the enclosure, was a large neon green sticker which said, in large print (and I'm paraphrasing from memory), ""DO NOT OPEN THIS ENCLOSURE WHILE THE SERVER IS POWERED ON.""

A few minutes later, everything was back up and running and no damage to equipment or data, so we were finally able to sit back and have a laugh about it.  Both myself and my co-worker are about to celebrate 23 years with the company, and we still have this government agency as a client, although about 10 years or so ago I moved to software development.

TL;DR:  I'm apparently a blind moron who can't read a giant neon green warning sticker.",The day I shut down an entire government agency,0
"Working in general PC remote support, we get a wide variety of calls as one might expect. One type of call that is consistent though is the call for printer assistance. Three different scenarios that made me scratch my head and wish these customers would get the spontaneous urge to go VERY green and decide they don't need a printer. . . 

**The First**

This lady I think was likely the most advanced of the users, she at least already had the printer and computer turned on and such, and I believe she'd already started successfully printing before.

\[*insert normal greetings/introductions of phone call and connection request to computer*\]

As I'm checking Control Printers, I see the printer was already connected to the computer once before at least, but now it showed a status of ""Not Connected"". The lady on the phone was still watching the screen and noticed the same status because she asked:

User1: Yeah that's my printer. It says 'not connected', does that mean it's connected?

M: Uhh, I would have to assume not. . . Is the blue light on the printer solid or flashing? (HP printer)

User1: Flashing.

M: Ah okay. Your printer isn't connected to your network, we'll need to get that connected, then we can properly connect it wirelessly. 

\[*insert fix and end call*\]

Seems she connected it via USB at some point, then disconnected it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Second**

Customers can obtain our support through a variety of means, one of which is specifically purchasing a card for printer support when they purchase a new printer at $AffiliatedStore. The rule for helping these customers is that they need to know their network information (name/password), and have already taken the printer out of the box and done the initial setup (ink, paper, etc). Our support was purely for the connection between computer and printer, downloading drivers/software etc.

Cue lady who hasn't done that and was under the impression someone would come out to her house:

User2: Hi, I want you to help me set up my printer.

Me: Absolutely, have you taken the printer out of the box, plugged it in, put paper in it, etc?

User2: No, I thought you guys would come out and do that for me.

Me: No, sadly, we're purely remote support, but once you get the printer set up, feel free to give us a call back and we can assist at that point. Just follow the instructions on the printer after you turn it on.

User2: Well hang on hang on, let me get it out of the box. (*oh boy*) 

Me: Oh, yeah just, uh, plug it in and turn it on and it should start taking you through the setup, just give us a call back.

User2: How do I turn it on??

Me: Uh... I'm not sure where the power button is as we support many different printers, but generally it---

User2: I found it, I found it. It's turning on and asking me for a date. What date am I supposed to put in there?? Today's date??

Me: (*muting microphone briefly*) No not today's date, just enter your birthday because that makes sense.... (*unmuting microphone*) Yes, today's date, but ma'am, we don't assist in this part as there's nothing we can really do aside from advise to just follow with what it's asking for. Please just give us a call back once it has the main menu portion.

\[*insert end phone call and big sigh*\]

&amp;#x200B;

**The Third/Final**

This last lady I didn't really have to help very much, but I was pretty baffled.

User3: Hi, I'm looking to set up my new $PrinterInfo, can you help?

Me: Sure! Have you already taken it out of the box, turned it on, done the initial setup?

User3: I took it out of the box, but it won't turn on.

Me: Hmm, okay, did you check to make sure it's plugged in all the way?

User3: What? This thing didn't come with any cords!! They said it was wireless!!

Me: \**stunned silence*\* uh, well... yes, it's wireless connecting to the computer, but... it still needs power.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Please stop printing.","No printer? No problems! Get rid of it, please. I will grovel.",0

"Quite a few years back i did workpractice as an automation technician  for a fairly large factory in my home town. And from there. 2 somewhat funny stories arose:

When i met in on my very first morning, i was paired up with one of the automation technicians (AT)  to go help in one of the machinehalls becouse one of the machines ""Wasn't working"" So he grapped his toolbag, and off we went!

We arived at the machinehall, and got to the machine in question with the operator standing next to it. ""All the lights were on in the machine but nothing works"" acording to said operator.

So AT pops open the controll panel to reveal all the wires and relays and what not on the insides, takes his multimeter and begins testing the various connections. (Should be noted, there's a complete set of schematics hanging on the inside of the doorpanel) But everything seems to be in order. So he asks me to hit the startup button, just to see what's going on.

As i'm about to push the button i notice there's a rather large dial, with the words ""Speed"" written above it. So i ofcourse ask AT what speed i should put it on. And out of the corner of my eye i notice the operator facepalming, whilst muttering ""I don't think there's any problems with the machine..."" the AT just chuckles ""Yea, think we're done here then"" And we went back. Nothing dramatic or anything, just...fun :D

The other one though, was a bit more dramatic.   
The other story happened when i had been there for about two weeks. We were called over to the RND department becouse all of their power had gone. So i head out with another AT to find and fix the problems.

We get there, and yup, no power anywhere. So we find the powerbox and see that the HPFI relay (A safety masterswitch kinda thing) had popped, so we flick it back on and pop, it goes again. We then pop all of the fuses, and turn the HPFI back on, no problems there, and begin plugging the fuses in again, untill the HPFI went out and thus we had found the culprit. A quick  glance over the schematics relaved that the wireset in question was ofcourse...the one that controlled the cieling ventilators, which were located on top of the building...no reason for this to be easy.

I inform all of the engineers and general RND personal that we'll be doing stuff with the power so don't turn on your machines or anything untill we give the okay for it. AT then handed me a radio and headed up and began checking the wires. Problem was fairly simple, some debres in the ventilatorshaft had damages some wires which had enabled the groundwire to touch the phase. Which in turn pops the HPFI. 

AT calls me on the radio and asks me to turn on the power, so i do so. He then does some work up there now that it's been confirmed that this was the issue (Mostly just clearing away debres, calling the boss to inform him what the problem was and wether we should just give it a patchwork, or replace the wires intirely. And after maybe 3-4 minutes calls me to turn the power back off, so i do that.  
Maybe ten seconds later, one of the RND folks comes running out, screeching about ""Why the power went out again?""  
Me: Becouse i turned it off?  
RND: But why'd you do that?! my machine was in the middle of its bootup!  
Me: Becouse..uh...i was asked to?  
RND, snaps the radio from my hand: I don't know who's on the other line, but get down here now!   
AT then hurries his butt down to where i'm at, and looks at RND  
RND: There you are, why'd you have the power turned off? you're the one who told me my machine don't take well to getting suddenly shut down like that!  
AT: Wait, you turned your machine on..why?  
RND: Becouse the power was back on? thought you guys were done!  
Then insued 5 minutes of absolute mayhem, AT began shouting at RND, who began shouting back.

It wasn't untill the head of RND called the boss from the automation technician department, that they both calmed down.  
But in the end, RND was repremanted for having turned his equipment on when told not to, suppose that's something?",Just 2 small stories...for the price of 1! :D,0
"I used to be a software developer at $OldFirm before becoming a software developer at $NewFirm just because I got tired of being micromanaged and the straight man of the team I was on for eight months. Here is one of my stories \*dun dun\*:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;$Boss: ""Hey, I need you to learn SAP""  
$Me: \*insert blank stare\*

You see, my boss at $OldFirm wasn't exactly the funniest clown in the circus. He seemed that way, but had a problem for overlooking important details (i.e. signing off on a project to get data from a DB into our application without asking if the client had the local version or the cloud version, but that's a different project). You know, the sh\*t that made my job infinitely harder. Anyhow, I digress from that.

My boss had a bad habit of Googling things for me, sending me the links, and thinking he had found Jesus or Buddha or something. Turns out we were integrating the cloud version of our product with a school district's SAP installation. It was a cool $50k contract if I recall correctly, and I was tasked with doing a POC that our $DocManager could connect to SAP. Wasn't too difficult to do as I used to be a Java developer (and now am again) and could work my way around Servlets decently well. For this story, we were tasked to build a form (that would save in $DocManager and send the data to SAP) for people to apply for transcripts. Yeah, it wasn't fun.

First and foremost, we developed two versions of the form. We had my gorgeous Bootstrap version that had the issue of creating two documents in $DocManager and had a few bugs to fix up that I was hoping our client leads could help fix up as I got back to better things such as managing the dumpster fire known as SAP-$DocManager integration, and the version one of our client leads developed that looked like the results of my breakfast 24 hours later.

Back to the SAP of the story. Well, the SAP integration was going ...not great. $School didn't have any resources to develop a web API on their end, and we didn't on ours because (and this is relevant to the next story) WE WERE A .NET SHOP. In comes our $ProjectManager who is accurately described by this one anecdote:

&gt;$ProjectManager: Wow, everything didn't burn down. I should go on vacation more often!  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me (internally, of course): Or just go on vacation ever...

Well, in comes $ProjectManager with her asking dumb questions (mostly to appease the client, but the client should know the answer):

&gt;$ProjectManager: What are we going to do to help $School get this done?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me (internally): Well, short of asking $OldFirm to pay to get me SAP certified (which they won't do for monetary reasons), nothing because that's all we can do.

Sadly, I don't know how that project ended. I quit before it was over. Got tired of all the micromanagement and watching my boss accidentally (I hope) torpedo a project and mention if it doesn't work we can ask the client for more cheddah cheese. Sure, $NewFirm has problems but boy do I not miss looking behind me whenever someone walks by.",Stuck in SAP,0

Cast of Characters:  Me-Me, a manager at an IT company.  CUS - Customer  Manager- My boss

So CUS has spent weeks cussing our company out because we wont ""fix"" his Excel that we sold him in the O365 package deal.  Emails back and forth in our ticketing system until the customer finally explodes and demands a manager to address his issue.

CUS has demanded to speak with Microsoft.  We've put him in contact with Microsoft no less than 10 times.  He emails into our ticketing system raging about the accents of the people at Microsoft, that they dont call him at the specific time he's requested for a callback or he isnt available for the callback.  Each time he's talked with Microsoft, they say very clearly that reprogramming Excel to do what he wants is not within their scope, but he's not hearing it.

So what does CUS want.  He wants someone to reprogram Excel to allow a checkin/checkout system (much like how Onedrive sharing or other file server sharing works but he wants it built into the individual program itself)  A way to insert photos and unalterable signatures and timestamps for his courier service.  Sound like a program anyone knows of? LOL.  And this guy spends about 20 bucks a month with our company.  He's hardly big enough of a fish to demand dev level contact with Microsoft.

So Me gets on the phone with this customer complaining about the accents of the people at Microsoft, how they wont call him, etc.  I stated to him that I was sorry but what he wanted was out of our scope, and even out of the support that Microsoft provides.  They only offer the support for the product to work as its designed to work, not to completely redesign their program just for him.   Apparently he didnt like this answer and started screeching at me that I was unhelpful, rude, how he couldnt understand people at Microsoft, how they're the evil empire, etc.

CUS:  ""I demand to speak to the owner of your company!""

Me:  I'm sorry, but I cant do that.

CUS ""Then let me speak to your manager!  I demand that you make this product work!  You sold it to me!""

Me:  ""What you want sir is something like Salesforce or Zendesk.  You need a CRM, not Excel to do what you're doing""

CUS  ""You sold me this product!  I demand your manager!""

Me:  Ok it will take a few minutes to get him

CUS:  I'll hold!

20 minutes later of this customer listening to some of the world's worst hold music (I hate our company's hold music)

Manager:  Manager here, how can I help?

CUS:  This witch is telling me I need to buy more things!  I demand to speak to the developers at Microsoft!   I need to do... (he lists off everything that something like Zendesk can do very well)

Manager:  Sir, I hear what you're saying but even we cant make Microsoft redesign their product.  A better product for you is one that we dont even sell.  But they're designed specially for what you're looking to do, they do this all of the time even for companies like Uber and Postmates.

CUS:  I've been going back and forth with your company for weeks and now you're telling me I have to buy more things!  I demand to speak with the company's owner or I'm calling my lawyer!

Manager:  That's fine sir, our legal team's email address is emailaddresshere.  But your lawyer is not going to make Excel do what you want.  A CRM program will.  Is there anything else

CUS:  I demand...

Manager:  I told you I cant do that, I gave you our legal team's email.  I also provided an alternate solution from a company that we get no benefit from just to help you with your project.  At this point this case is resolved.  Have a good day.

"A recent post reminded me of the following:

I was working an overseas, combat zone job. The camp is run on generators and every couple of months all the generators would be shut down for several hours for some reason, it normally happened at 3am.  Middle of the night I get someone loudly pounding on my living container door, I stumble out of bed, try to switch on the light which doesn't work, grab a flashlight and answer the door.

Idiot User: hey the internet is down

Me: you have power?

IU looking confused: no, the generators are down for maintenance 

Me: the how in the %@)× do you think the internet would be up?

IU whines: but I need it

Me: need in one hand and $#!* in the other, cause I can't help ya

IU: no need to be rude

Me: FU, you come waking me up at 3am for stupid $%&amp;#* %&amp;#*@[ $&amp;÷($ go away

And I closed the door and went back to sleep. 
Next morning my boss from several hundred miles away calls and asked me WTF? I explained and he told me to keep up the good work.  The IU didn't talk to me for a month.

FTR; I did provide 7x24x365 support and on more than one occasion got out of bed in the middle of the night to troubleshoot network issue as I understood how important connectivity back to the world was, but stupid pisses me off and I'm not at my best at 3am :)

"So back before there was Cable Internet there was DSL, and before that there was Dial-up. I worked at a Dial-up ISP and was on the escalations team. ----Enough back story. 

Here is the cast:

Me is well me

CW: is Co-worker

ID10T User is customer on the phone.

On to the story. 

So it was the day after Christmas and I was working the escalations desk and one of my co-workers comes to me with an issue.

It seams that ID10T user had called in because he was having some connections issues. He had just got a brand new, out of the box,  Gateway computer. I know it was that long ago. Now when he was setting it up and when he got to connecting the phone line to the internal dial-up modem he found that the RJ11 connecter was not on the end of the line. 

Now being the smart and resourceful user he is does he go and buy a new phone line??????
Nope, if he did he would not be calling my co-worker. He striped the end of the wires that make up the phone line and sticks it in to the modem port. 

Now most people don’t know that phone lines carry around 48 volts down them to supply the phone’s ringer with power.  

Well my Co-worker tell me this and said that the ID10T user wanted to talk to above her. So I have her transfer the call to me and talk to the guy. 

$Me: Hello sir I understand that you having an issue with your computer connecting to the internet?

$ID10T User: Ya, I plugged the phone line in to the modem and turned the computer on and there was a loud popping and smoke started to come from the hard drive and the monitor. Your internet killed my computer. What are you going to do to make it work?

$ME: Well sir I was informed that you striped the wires in the phone line and plugged that right in to the modem, is that right?

$ID10T user: Ya……..So?

$ME: Well sir there is about 48 volts that is in that phone line. What YOU have done is fry your computer. The voltage has fried the modem, monitor, motherboard, the processor, and the ram. You have turned you computer in to a very expensive paperweight. 

$ID10T user: What are you going to do to fix it. 

$ME: There is nothing I can do to FIX the issue, you broke the computer’s warranty when you did what you did. You will have to try to contact Gateway or the place you got the computer from to see if can be fixed. 

$ID10T user: What do I tell them?

$ME: Well sir that is up to you, I can not tell to lie to them but will have to talk to them to get it fixed. 

Thus ends the story of how an IB10T user fired his computer with a phone line.

"This was about 15 years ago, I worked support for a major medical center's medical records department.  Imagine a large number of ""temporary"" trailers installed temporarily 30+ years ago, full of paper floor to ceiling.  (And this is just the ""current files,"" we have an Indiana Jones-style warehouse of paper files going back almost 100 years).  Naturally, we have halon fire suppression because we're working in a literal tinderbox.

One day, the sweet old lady who works the paper charts requests desk comes running into my work area yelling ""Theodusian, help! My computer is on fire!""

This seems... serious.  So I bolt to my feet and follow her back to her desk, where she points to the back of her computer.  There is a soft yellow flicker coming from the dark space behind the computer.

Her: ""Look, it's sparking and there's a fire back there!  I think it's shorting out!""

I'm already thinking this isn't as serious as ""on fire,"" so I pull the computer out and look behind it.  Sure enough, the yellow flicker is from the ethernet port on the back of the PC.

Me: ""Actually, ma'am, it's supposed to do that while it's working.  Everything is okay, and nothing is shorting out.""

"From my nightmares and the mid 2000s. I give you, The Day of the Cactus.

It's a nice quiet morning in the call center in L2 support at a major US telecom. It's a Saturday.

It's around 11:00AM . I clocked on almost 3 hours ago and I've taken a whopping 2 calls. Only one of those needed troubleshooting, the other was simple. It's so slow our team is gathered around in a ground yakking and playing games rather than at our respective stations.

The room is pretty small, only about 25 people in the room fully staffed. About half that are in the room.

Up on the wall is a gigantic map of the United States, made up of LEDs. Most of the map is green, this indicates everything is normal. A few parts are yellow, this means trouble has been reported but the system is still responding. A few red spots and dots here and there, indicating outages.

I've got my shoes off with my feet up on my desk reading a book.

All in all, it's a wonderfully relaxing day.

Then it all went wrong. Terribly wrong.

First was the beeping alarms, which none of us knew existed. What the hell is that god-awful racket coming out of EVERY terminal?!

Then I see the wall, and my heart has stopped for a moment.

California, from the middle to Los Angeles, has gone red.

Millions of people are out of service.

In the room we are staring at the map, the computers and each other. Then headsets start beeping as people start receiving calls. I get a call. Within a minute there are HUNDREDS of calls in my queue, the general queue is in the HIGH THOUSANDS and climbing rapidly.

My system has populated an account from the Los Angeles area. Customer is pissed, has no service whatsoever. I try and cannot get a response from his phone. Actually, NOTHING will respond, it's like a meteor has destroyed Southern California, except I'm on a landline with someone right now.

The entire call center is slammed, I have to tell my customer I'll give a call back then put myself into ""Not Ready"" to start investigating what the hell is going on. Nobody in the room knows anything yet.

The problem is in the GSM network, everything else is working. I can reach all the equipment, but all GSM traffic falls into a black hole of unresponsiveness.

Someone shouts! There it is! There is a station not responding along Interstate 5! It's COMPLETELY unresponsive, like I can't even talk to the internet equipment and that is very not good. It's *the* link between the halves of the state. The rest of the network does NOT appreciate this link being down either, problems are widespread as the system tries, but cannot handle the load. Other systems are now being affected.

Emergency dispatch technicians to the area to determine what the hell is going on. My Nortel has the call queue in the 10's of thousands. The previously laid back atmosphere in the room is now grim as death.

Agonizing, useless incoming escalation after escalation where I can't tell them ANYTHING useful grinds on. People are very unwilling to hang up the damn phone without any kind of answers. It's grueling and repetitive.

Finally word (and pictures) come back from the dispatched technicians.... There *is* no relay station. It's gone the way of Alderaan.

A truck driver with a fully loaded trailer fell asleep at the wheel and drove off the highway. He made it way off the road and plowed straight through our gigantic fake cactus and associated hardware of a relay station. Obliterated, nothing to fix and the site isn't even usable. Sweet Jesus.

The whole time, I'm fielding calls that I obviously can't do anything about and people are *pissed*. (I actually did get ONE call from someone NOT in the affected area who waited through that queue, only one out of hundreds, but it was a welcome relief.)

So this is how we got to learn to build and deploy a mobile relay station. It took a crazy effort between teams to build out the equipment, then figure out how to deploy. By the end of my nightmare shift, the link was functioning and was literally a van-network parked around the brutalized remains of a giant fake cactus and outbuilding. Things were finally coming under control around the time I left and the queue was emptying.

By the time I walked out the doors, about a hundred two-minute long calls later, I felt like I'd run a marathon. Physically and mentally exhausted. I don't even remember the drive home. My head hit the pillow before the sun had set. The Day of the Cactus, was finally over.",The Day of the Cactus,0
"About 40 years ago I worked as a ""system programmer"" for a company that in one line of business made video terminal controllers for IBM mainframes. One of our customers was having trouble with theirs and a series of ""experts"" was flown out to the customer to solve the problem. I was one of the people sent. 

The customer had a  [IBM 360/50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360_Model_50) in rather grungy shape, as they allowed smoking in the machine room. Their support contractor (3rd party, not IBM) and I agreed this was bad and the customer should be told to clean things up. But the problem seemed to be that the terminal controller kept randomly dropping offline. We went through all sorts of diagnostics and began to suspect an error in the mainframe's processing of peripheral interrupts. Luckily I had recently read Bell and Newell's book on computer architectures and the 360/50 was one of the case studies they presented, so I was familiar with the /50's inner workings. But I needed the book.

A phone call back to the office told the next engineer who was flying out the next day to bring along the copy of this book I knew to be in the corporate library. With it in hand I was able to read the technical diagrams and microcode listings that IBM helpfully provides in big binders in a wheeled rack along with the computer. Turning to the relavant circuit diagram, I observed pencil notations around the suspected cicrcuitry. ""Aha! Somebody has been here before! The plot thickens!"" The support guy said it was not him. At one point I am reduced to not only single-stepping the 360/50 through its interrupt handler, but *micro*-single-stepping it and watching the blinking lights. That is, I was single-stepping through the 360/50s *microcode*.  Still could not catch the problem.  (Can you imagine Intel allowing anyone to do that today?  Or even providing the documentation necessary to do it, much less the ""user interface""?)

Then taking a break, I am staring at our terminal controller, a short rack about 1 meter tall placed near the mainframe when all of a sudden its display panel shows it is restarting, all by itself. Huh? Why would it do that? A check with the design engineers tell me it would do that if it had a power interruption. 

Smelling a rat, we follow its power cord to see where it was plugged in.  Turns out, whoever had installed it plugged it into a convenience outlet in the computer room that was intended for the janitorial staff to use with their vacuum cleaner. This outlet proved to have rather dirty power that would get particularly nasty spikes whenever the building elevator started moving.

We had the side panels of the 360/50 open at this point and I observed a power outlet inside. The support guy said it is filtered power from the 360/50's internal power supply, and they use it to plug in test equipment.  We unplugged the terminal controller from its dodgy outlet, we lifted some floor tiles, and rerouted the power cord over to the mainframe and plugged it into this filtered outlet. Problem solved.",Do the simple checks first,0

"This was the helpdesk ticket I got yesterday. Now in addition to being a helpdesk lackey, I also am the Skype for Business engineer/admin aka The Phone Guy.

Yesterday one of our sales reps emails and say ""Every time I call my office number it says ""No Longer in Service"". Me being the good phone guy I am, dial her number through Skype and get her voicemail. Then to double check I pull out the Development cell phone (not giving her my REAL number lol) and call. I get her voicemail again. Perfect, ticket closed....

But wait...there's more.

This morning I get an angry call from the ladies boss because I didn't fix the problem. Me, being the incredibly polite and articulate person I am (sarcasm) said ""I ain't fixed da problem because there ain't no problem!!!""  He told me ""she called her number and still gets the message ""no longer in service"". I say ""Okay"" and agree to see what's wrong. I call the number again and get the ladies voicemail. Call the boss back, number works fine. Lady still INSISTS it doesn't. I ask the boss to call the number...SURPRISE!!! it works fine. Lady STILL insists she gets the same message. I finally ask her what number she is calling and she has transposed two of the numbers. Big deal, we've all done it. I tell her the correct number and she SWEARS that she has been getting calls on the transposed number for the last 6 months. She INSISTS that I am wrong and she is going to let he boss know and I need to fix it NOW!

This is where it starts getting fun...since I'm terribly wrong, I ask her to check her email signature. It has the correct phone number. I was told ""I must've changed it"" (yeah lady, whatever) so since I ""changed it"" I asked her to check the number on her business cards. I must've changed those too (damn, I'm good since I'm 1800 miles away and just got this ticket yesterday)! I closed her ticket (again) with ""could not duplicate""  and then my CIO called me in his office because the lady called him directly because I'm unprofessional (true) and unhelpful (probably also true) and I got to explain the problem to him. He laughed, shook his head and told me to quit pissing people off and I said ""but boss...it's only 9am. The day is just getting started. Don't put those kinds of constraints on me this early!"" He laughed again and told me to GET OUT and go back to work.

"You ever find yourself in a dead end job that you find one that seems almost too good to be true, so you jump on it only to find out it's only marginally better than the dead end you just left? Well that was my last gig. I was hired to be part of a team that was working as a vendor to do on-site L1 internal tech support for a major healthcare company. I had been with them for about 7 months at the point in this incident.

An employee calls in because they were having trouble with their account in one of their programs &amp; had previously reported it. I looked over the ticket thinking that maybe one of us missed something. I noticed the ticket was about a month old at this point and no ticket notes had been added by the assigned group since we assigned it to them. It's well passed the suggested SLA for that group &amp; we were under orders to only be on a call for no more than 15 minutes, so couldn't do too much troubleshooting to try and help the poor guy out. The program was vital to his position and his boss was starting to get very angry he wasn't able to do his job for a month.

I notice that I was getting close to our call time limit, so I mention that I'll send a email to the group asking for an update on the ticket and to have them follow-up with the caller. You can hear he isn't happy that it's not resolved still (probably because his boss was going to still be mad), but understands that at least I'm trying to help the guy out anyway I can. I sent out the email with a CC to my team lead and their boss as well so they're in the loop of this &amp; do a bit of CYA.

The next morning I got an email from the department head that I couldn't believe &amp; my cubical neighbors couldn't believe either. I was being yelled at for ""taking initiative"" in helping the caller &amp; how we shouldn't. We all looked at each other were in complete shock as to what we were reading. My direct team lead didn't come in till later on in the day, so I flagged down one of the other leads that I was friendly with and had him read over the email &amp; he couldn't believe what I was being yelled at for either. It was at that moment we all realized that we weren't in a tech support role, or even a customer service call center roll, but a glorified switchboard. It was also at that moment that I knew I couldn't last there much longer and made sure my resume was updated and posted on multiple job sites by my lunch break.

Turns out that not only did we have that time limit, but the lead's boss told us that the most important person is the last one in the call queue, not the one I'm on the phone with. Thankfully, I did get a much better job a few months later &amp; they know how a tech support queue is handled. One ticket at a time, the most important caller is the one you're speaking too, don't worry about time limits, just take care of the customer &amp; DO take every initiative to do whatever you can to help them.",What are we here for then?,0

" Gather close my friends for the tale I tell is one fraught with danger, intrigue, and suspense. We join our plucky SAN admin as she embarks on an epic quest to clear the Dungeon of RCA!

As usual, our plucky SAN Admin, Peach, (full BOFH creds) was bright and perky, but that day especially.  She had acquired one Junior BOFH,  who had not passed all of his BOFH certifications, but was working arduously on them, and one pimply faced youth to help her manage her 13PB kingdom, and they, after another arduous journey (a tale for another time) had acquired keys to half of the kingdom, Gold and Europium .  They were now approved to go on quests of their own, instead of tagging along behind clapping coconuts.

Junior BOFH was given the task of the caring and feeding of the hardware dragons.  Now, as we all know, hardware dragons can be tricky beasts.  If feed properly, and groomed, they sleep through the day, but if angered, the Gods themselves cower.  The production SVC dragon living in Gold, owned by the Lord of Gold, had a failed battery on one it's nodes, and was very upset the wound had not been addressed in 12 days.  Why, you ask, would someone leave a poor dragon in agony for 12 days??  Well, the bean counter in charge of warranties forgot to renew the maintenance contract and Junior BOFH was unable to acquire the battery.  

Finally, the contract renewed, the Junior BOFH contacted the doctor to come repair the SVC dragon.  He created the proper incident for tracking, and the appropriate paperwork known as an expedited change record, and waited to hear from the doctor to agree on a time to fix the dragon.  The doctor, deciding the Junior BOFH was too junior, contacted the Lord of Gold instead.  They agreed on a time, and the LOG informed Peach, and her squires of the time, had already raised the incident to a Severity 1, and requested an emergency change be raised as the SVC dragon could forget some wisdom imparted should the 2nd battery fail, and the node go down gracelessly.  

The Junior BOFH did not fear as he felt he was up to the task of working with the doctor to mend the Golden SVC dragon, but he had never worked on an SVC dragon before and the doctor had asked him to power off the node to prevent further damage to the dragon, but never fear, Peach was there!  She gave him the proper GUI procedure, Select the failed node, Right click on the Node, Power off and the dragon will be mollified.  Easy peasy.

No, as we all know, the Elder Gods of Tech Support love a good laugh from time to time, and you should not tempt them by saying such things as Easy Peasy.  Our Junior BOFH selected the node, right clicked on what he thought was the node, selected power off, did not understand the message the SVC dragon was trying to give him, lulled the dragon with a sleep treat (code), and promptly put the dragon to sleep.

Now, this dragon was important for a number of reasons as it controlled a great deal of treasure, including, but not limited to, the connection to the trading house known as Wall Street.  This connection was down for 45 min while the dragon was revived (2 min), and the power of reboot was used to bring the connection back online(43 min), however the damage to the kingdom had been done, and Peach, poor Peach, must now enter the Dungeon of RCA, where there is much sorrow and nashing of teeth and it is unknown if she will ever return.

TL;DR New guy has his mouse over the wrong area, selects power off for the entire SVC cluster, takes down trading, among other things, for a very, very big client.  Fallout is unsure as I'm still dealing with the RCA process, but lets just say, big executives are involved.",The Dungeon of RCA,0
"So I work at a video bridging services company, which basically hosts the video conferences of other companies. We have a reservation system wherein customers let us know which conferences need to take place. We have a customer support team that answers the phone and e-mail and solves simple connection problems. We also get a lot of calls about reservations though, about changing dates, times, locations, about cancellations, new reservations, etc. etc. It causes some problems that we are not able to focus on the technical difficulties anymore because of all this communication about reservations.

Management decides the phone will now first be answered by a newly hired lady first. This lady will handle the call herself if it concerns a reservation issue, but will put it through to us if it concerns a technical issue. She has no access to the servers and no technical knowledge.

I get a call from her on one day. It´s customer x, they are having a really important meeting and one party complains they cannot see or hear anything. Right away I see that the connection on our bridge is fine. The other party can see them, our bridge can see them, our bridge can see the other party. Video and audio is sent both ways, from and to both systems. I have a hunch what the problem is already, but the customer asks me to disconnect and reconnect the site that cannot see anything just to see if it fixes the problem. I tell him I am very sure it won´t help and that I need him to walk into the room with the video system. He (I know) does not want to go back in there while there is still an issue. He needs to have it solved when he walks back in he tells me.

While the customer is on the phone. I get a new call from the newly hired lady on my videosystem. She pops in to say she has a new call saying I should just do what they ask and disconnect and reconnect. She has another customer asking the same thing as well. So now I have three people telling me the same thing. They are stressed and getting angrier by the second. None of them know as much as I do about the video connection, but who the fuck am I right? So I give in, albeit blunt, ¨Allright both systems have been disconnected and reconnected, please call back when you want me to solve the actual problem¨, and I hang up. Everyone hangs up.

Five minutes later the original caller calls back and asks me to have another look. I let him walk into the room with the video system, point him towards a button he needs to push and all of a sudden the connection comes to life. 

Why,? The video system has a separate screen with built in speakers (I wish I could control all that remotely), which was on sleep mode.

"Ever since getting into IT I get asked for help with people's networks, computers, printers, etc. all the time. Most of the time if they're family or a close friend I'll do it for free. I had a few people I work with ask me to come to their house and set up their new computer. Their *personal* computer that they keep at their *house* and don't use for work.

""Ok, my rate is $50 an hour, but I'll cut it to $35 since I know you.""

""Wait, you're gonna charge me?""

""Yes. This is a side business.""

""But we work together and you're in the IT department. It should be free.""

""Is this a work computer?""

""No, but you're in the IT department.""

""Yes, I'm in the IT department at your *work.* If this is a personal computer then I charge for my time because I'm not getting paid by the company to work on your stuff outside business hours.""

This lady told her boss I ""wasn't willing to do \[my\] job"" and help with her computer, conveniently leaving out that it was a personal computer at her house. Her boss came into my office and said ""Karen said you wouldn't help with her computer. Why not?""

""Did she tell you *which* computer? Because she wants me to go to her house after work and set up her personal computer. She also hinted she needs help with her network and her printer as well. I told her I'd cut her a deal on my hourly rate, but she thinks I should do it for free.""

""Wait, she wanted help with her own personal computer? Not her work computer?""

""Exactly.""

Her boss then goes off and tells her that the IT department doesn't do house calls and if she wants help she'll have to pay someone. She still couldn't understand how it wasn't our job to deal with her personal property and gave me dirty looks until she got fired a few weeks later.",But you're the IT department!,0
"The IT department where I work use TeamViewer (TV) to remote into user PCs.  Most IT staff use the full version, while the host version is installed on all other PCs, RDS environments, and mobile devices.  In the case of desktops and laptops, the host is pushed down automatically by a software deployment server, and a .reg is run to apply certain settings.  A security group excludes computers from having this version pushed down.

The company recently switched their hardware supplier, which has meant new laptops will be off the Dell variety, rather than Lenovo.  As I understand it, part of the deal with this supplier involved getting decent discounts on kit, as long as we spent *x* amount of money on our first order.  Who better to treat with new kit than the IT department themselves.  Thus a large order was placed for a load of 17"" Dell Precision Laptops, kitted out with 512GB nVME SSDs, 1TB HDDs, 32GB RAM, i7 processors, etc, for all the company's developers, infrastructure engineers, and on call service desk staff.  I'm somehow getting one too, as my role is classified as a *mobile*, even though I've spent maybe 10 days over the last year at sites other than my own.  Though I guess I do work from home 1-2 days a week ...

The IT team in another office was tasked with the project of building them all.  They use a basic image from a WDS environment, which installs the operating system, runs a few scripts, and adds the computer to the domain, and a few applications are pushed down from a software deployment server over the next few hours, and the rest is installed manually.  Kinda tedious, but pretty simple.

But the team started to have issues with these new laptops.  The OS was meant to be installed on the SSD, but WDS was installing it on the HDD.  It turned out that this was because BIOS or something in the system defined the HDD as Disk 0, and the WDS image was configured to install the OS on Disk 0.  Despite it being possible to disable the HDD in the BIOS, forcing the OS to install on the SSD, the team chose to go for a slightly more tedious solution.  They'd open the laptops up, physically disconnect the HDD, install the image, turn the laptop off, and then plug the HDD back in.

This was the process that was decided upon, which I saw because I'm included in the service desk distribution list as I help them out with automating stuff through PowerShell.  The service desk on my site all concurred that this was a stupid process and they wouldn't follow it if they ever come to building one of these new laptops.

But whatever.  Not my department.  Not my office.  Not my problem.

After the team had built a few test laptops, sent them out to a few testers, and solved a couple of issues they had encountered, they ramped up *production*.  On day three, two staff they deployed images to 14 laptops, and figured they could get the rest of the software installed on them the next day.  But, the next day, they discovered a problem.

They had left the laptops on overnight to download updates and such and, in the process, the host version of TV had been installed.  They tried to uninstall TV, but were unsuccessful.  'TeamViewer is already running, please close and try again' was the error, or something to that effect.  *'But we have closed TV!'*  The problem was that a second process runs along with TeamViewer.exe.  It's called 'TeamViewer_Service.exe'.  And they never realised this.  So their solution to the problem they had on these 14 laptops was to apply a registry edit to stop TeamViewer running on startup, then restart the computer, and then uninstall TeamViewer.

Once TV had been uninstalled, they were free to install the full version of TV, log in with the company license, and then continue with the rest of the build.  They did this on a couple of laptops, and then handed them out to users that were based on their site.  But these laptops were soon returned.  Why?  Because they hadn't put them in the security group that prevents the host version of TV being pushed down.  So the software deployment server had scanned the PC, discovered they have the wrong version of TV installed, closed the **TWO** processes, and then proceeded to uninstall it, then reinstall the ~~correct~~ host version.  By this time, the users of the initial trial laptops had returned them to the team for fixing as well.

By the time the team found out what had happened, over half the laptops they've upgraded to the full version of TV have reverted to the host version.  So they added the laptops to the correct security group, made the registry edit to stop the **TWO** processes launching on startup again, restarted the laptops, uninstalled the host version of TV, and then installed the full version.  They were now four days into this project and every laptop they had issued had been returned to them.  Four days and not a single successful laptop build.  And they sent out another email to the service desk, informing everyone of the *new* process.

But whatever.  Not my department.  Not my office.  Not my problem.

Day five went well.  They issued nearly all the laptops they had built, and started to install WDS images onto more.  But, towards the end of the day, they had a couple more laptops returned to them.  What was the issue?  The options page in TV was locked behind a password.  And the standard password didn't work.  This password is used for configuring a custom static password for remote access, disabling the standard password all the PCs in the company have.  This is something the IT teams liked to have.  It also allowed them to restrict the default level of access when sharing their screen, something they liked for when showing other team members something, without allowing them access to control their computer.  And nobody in the team knew, or could figure out, what the password was.

This password was set by the .reg that was run when the host version was pushed down by the software deployment server.  And the team didn't know how to revert the changes.  In their defence, they did ask infrastructure, who would have been able to supply the .reg, but they were fobbed off with a non answer.  Faced with no idea of how to revert these registry changes, they began to completely rebuild all the laptops they had built so far, and announced the new process in an email to everyone on the service desk and in infrastructure.  It spanned half of one of my screens, but the gist of it was:

&gt;If a PC or laptop has the Host version of TeamViewer installed, but the user requires the Full version of TeamViewer, a full rebuild of the PC or laptop will be required to revert the registry changes made as part of the automatic deployment of the host version.
&gt;
&gt;Ensure that the PC or laptop has been placed in the necessary Security Group to prevent installation of the Host version of TeamViewer, else you'll have to rebuild the PC or laptop again.

But whatever.  Not my department.  Not my office.  Not my problem?  Nah.  I wasn't going to stay out of this one.

You see, this is an issue the team on my site had faced.  In their team, which actually spanned three sites, they had had three leavers in as many months earlier in the year.  And they had encountered a similar problem when building a desktop and laptop for two of the new starters brought in to replace the leavers.  And they came to me for help.  I did a little bit of investigating, and spoke to a few of the infrastructure engineers to figure out how the deployment of TV worked.  In the process, I got hold of the .reg file that applied the standard company settings for the host version of TV.

The .reg made changes to a load of values in about 10 subkeys.  So reverting these changes was simple; simply remove the subkeys.  They'll be recreated when you reinstall TV, and most of them are likely deleted when you uninstall TV (not all, obviously, or the issues above wouldn't have occurred).  But there's no need to actually check which ones are there and which ones aren't.  Just put change each [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\...] or whatever to [-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\...], and every single change would be reverted, leaving you with a clean slate to install the correct version of TV on.

Thus my solution to the problem consisted of six simple steps:

1. Log in as domain admin  
2. Run a PowerShell script to add the computer to the necessary security group  
3. Run a .bat to TASKKILL TeamViewer.exe and TeamViewer_Service.exe  
4. Uninstall the current version of TeamViewer  
5. Run a .reg script that reverts the changes made to the registry by the software deployment server  
6. Install the new version of TeamViewer

I hit 'Reply to all' on the email, and put in the path to the above three scripts, along with a little description of what they do.  There were actually six files, rather than three.  The files for steps 1, 4 and 6 were text files, named after what needed to be done at each step.  And the three scripts were numbered 2, 3, and 5, named simply 'run this'.

A few minutes later, the guy that sent the original email, explaining the process, replies to all to say 'your 6 steps have not been tested and are not guaranteed to work'.  He goes on to explain that I'm not authorised to dictate what processes the service desk and infrastructure should use, and that his process had been approved by both the heads of the service desk and infrastructure.

Cue the greatest email I've ever read, sent to the entirety of the service desk and infrastructure teams, including their managers, **edit: from a member of one of the other service desk teams**:

&gt;Shitting in the shower isn't the approved process either, but it uses less water than a toilet flush making it environmentally friendly, and leaves you with a cleaner finish than rubbing hour hole with toilet paper as well.
&gt;
&gt;If it works, it works.  And this looks hella faster than rebuilding a computer from scratch.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, cockadoodleinmyass!

The on site service desk team behind me burst out laughing, and began to call other members of IT over to read his response.  And, soon after, the head of infrastructure replied.

&gt;While I wouldn't approve with your anecdote, I agree with your principle.  If it works, do it.  That's all the approval I gave [original email sender] for his process.  I've had a look through the scripts and they look good.  The above steps will probably take about 5 minutes to run, rather than countless hours of a full rebuild.  But I'll leave it to you to decide which route you go down.
&gt;
&gt;Also, please don't be offended if I opt not to shake your hand next time I'm on your site.

"I work as the Jack-of-all-Trades IT guy for a medium-sized business. One of my most recent actions was to stop using Teamviewer (which we weren't paying for) and since we didn't have the budget (nor the need honestly) for a license and after getting approval from management, I deployed Winvnc on all our machines. Free remote control software that is pretty easy to deploy and works well in a LAN, that's all we needed. Everything was working smoothly and I was pretty happy with myself.

...Until one of our sales guy came to me asking ""Hey OP, what is this icon that appeared recently in the bottom right corner ?""

Me : ""Oh it's the new remote control software I just deployed.""

Him : ""Some guys downstairs looked it up on google and they think management is spying on us with this""

Me (*Confused*) : ""What ? No, i'm the only one having access to it anyway, and i only use it for remote support""

Him : ""But it can be used for spying right ? They found some stories about it""

Me : ""Well... I guess technically it could since it can remotely take control of any PC he's deployed in, but management doesn't have access to it, and I'm only using it for remote control. Besides that would be completely illegal""

Fortunately my explanations convinced him, but still, out of curiosity I googled ""winvnc spying"" (in my language) to see what they stumbled upon...Turns out there are A LOT of stories about unethical use of the software. It never occurred to me how easily I could use it for spying, so I guess my users kinda have a point there.

In the end, I told my users that the day I'll spy on them, I won't use a software with an icon that looks like a mix between Sauron and the Illuminati. I think that convinced them.","No I'm not spying on you, but I guess I could",0
"Back at it again with my tech illiterate co-worker. I've been swamped with tickets lately - 1. because my co-worker always works from home meaning she gets paid to do nothing while I do all the work and 2. my coworker has no idea what she is doing when she actually works on tickets. To solve the first issue, I decided to have tickets be assigned to us individually so we know who is working on what. I decided on this after I realised I closed 8 tickets while she closed 3 (all the same difficulty level).  


Yesterday, a ticket came in about someone needing a solution for their slow computer since they were working on high-importance spreadsheets. I gave them a loaner laptop a couple weeks ago, but it seems that didn't work out. So they put in another ticket asking for other solutions. When I was about to message my manager about getting an upgrade approved, my co-worker said she would work on it and she assigned it to herself (since all other tickets were assigned to me showing she wasn't doing much). I told her that was fine but she needs to get with the manager about getting an upgrade approved (they were on Windows 7 32-bit 4GB RAM). She said 'ok'. About an hour later I check on the ticket... her resolution 'I cleared up some disk space. Let me know if you still have problems'. aka she didn't do what I told her to do

The user didn't reply. Instead, the next day, we get an e-mail from the freaking CIO asking about the situation of the ticket saying the user needs to be taken care of immediately since the user has critical work that has a deadline of THIS FRIDAY. So the ticket gets escalated to create a new VM for them with Windows 10, 64-bit, and 8GB RAM.   


There ends up being trouble spinning up the VM, so it comes back to me to get a spare Windows 10 desktop and update it to meet the required specs. I end up having to stay over because of it.

Guess I shouldn't have suggested assigning tickets to ourselves, since it got us in this clusterfuck.",Who needs 64-bit Office when I can just clear up disk space? - thought process of my co-worker,0

I got hired by a family friend to make a website, and we agreed that i will be making a website for him for around the costs of 500€.

We singed a contract just to make sure we had that on paper, and ofcourse me being me i assumed that he had some sort of Web / Computer infrastructure which i could build the website on, be it something like Wix or more Classic like an actual server where it needs to be hosted at.

And while we both spoke about what should be stated in the contract i stated that i need the access to his Web Infrastructure, and this nut job understood that i want access to his home WIFI.
He told me that he will write me everything on WhatsApp and at that time i was very sure i will get some sort of Remote Server Access or atleast some money to host something of my own.

But noup, he hits me with ""This is my Wifi Password"" 
and the following conversation ensues,

Me: ok , thats nice, but i still need the access to your server and or where you want me to host the 
website on.

Him: Yeha just host it on my WIFI, its got internet.

Me: Thats not how this works, i need a computer where i can host the website on, and that then be called a server

Him: Oh yhea just use my Computer then.

Me: You do know that than no one would be able to access your site when the Computer is off?

Him: Can't they just download my site onto their Computer and go onto it while my Computer is off?

Me: Thats not how this works....

Him: Well i payed you money, you just buy a computer from that and set it up here, and then we put the website onto it and i won't turn it off. 

Me: No, you payed me to build a website not to provide what is neccescary stuff to actually host a website, i assumed you knew what is needed to actually host a website.

Him: Yes ofcourse  i know what is neccescary, a computer and internet.
Thus my WIFI Password to you and i have a computer here.

I prep a few slides to present the findings. A few days before the meeting, I'm told that John, the guy Recruiter previously placed has surfaced from hiding and will be coming out with me. We're also going to be presenting to Client's new security engineer who is coming in to meet us.
  
I fly out with Recruiter and John on a small jet to Client's city. We bullshit for a while, but John is a little wary of me.   
  
We land, grab a rental car and make our way to a hotel a rung up from the usual consultant storage unit. An hour later, I'm in the bar, seeking sustenance, reading a book, sketching out the high points I want to make. For an artifical environment such as a hotel bar, it's busier than I'd expect for a weekday.  
  
Pretty much everybody at this bar is a business traveler. Smiles and corporate speak are abundant. Some flirting happens over open laptops. It's fun to watch. For some people, this is a moment away from spouses and children. Perhaps what happens at the Marriott stays at the Marriott.

Two men who look like band members from a forgotten 80's hair metal band are in the bar, looking around. One is wearing a leather jacket and a few bright scarves. The other looks like an extra from Macklemore's Thift Shop video. Leather pants with odd buckles, a striped wool shirt and some kind of fake fur vest make up his ensemble. He's also wearing a top hat with goggles.

I smile to the woman sitting next to me, subtly point to the Britny Fox tribute band and shrug my shoulders, then go back to my notes.  
  
I'm trying to order my issues with Client without coming across as negative. They're hosting in a colocation facility and claiming all the co-lo's audits as their own. That'll be a conversation with their salespeople. They're not patching stuff or scanning for vulnerabilities. I'll talk with the security engineer and see if they need suggestions.  
  
Maybe they need older systems to be compatible. Maybe we can work out some compromises.   
  
Over my drink, I notice that the two oddly dressed people have split up and are slowly working the room. They're approaching women, talking to them for a few minutes, then move on when it seems they didn't get what they wanted.  
  
Maybe they're selling time-shares.   
  
I see the Recruiter and John make their way into the bar. They make their way to a table and don't seem to notice me. I assume Recruiter wants to chastize John about becoming unavailable and discuss whose end my pay is coming out of.

"Our customer has a proprietary software for their production that runs in a Linux virtual that I maintain. The software has always been really painful to upgrade, as they ship the updates by sending random bits and pieces of the software over e-mail, which at times don't interact right with the software as they've forgotten the new update also needs some other files. Also worth noticing is that the company making the software has 3 guys, the owner who's para-technical, some dude who knows a bit about stuff and then a total cowboy programmer who'd probably ship the software after each added line.

Snapshotting the virtual has saved the day numerous times, but the updates they send have since become an inside joke, as the company making the software often briefs the customer that 'it's just a quick update, won't take 5 minutes' and then it causes hours and hours of work for us when we go back and forth with the software provider about why it fails to start.

to minimize our pain, i've numerous times suggested that they should package the software. after some time and numerous larger than expected bills, the customer also agreed with us. 

they take their sweet time, telling us they've been having problems with Debian packages but eventually a .deb lands in my e-mail instead of the typical assortment of random script files.

I install it and make a note that it stays quite a long time in the post-install script, but after the install expected pieces are where they should be so I don't investigate further.

One day I receive another update and running dpkg -l with the package name I accidentally use dpkg -L, which instead of listing the installed package status and version lists the files inside the package.

My jaw hits the keyboard. The package has one file inside, a huge tar-file. I immediately extract the new version package I received and to my horror realize what they've done.

They tarred up the software, packaged the tar-file plus a post-install script that extracts the tar-file.

I'm left in awe how much you can misunderstand what a package manager does.","When you say 'Debian package', this isn't what it meant",0
"We have a group of technical non-IT folks where I work.  It would be a stretch to describe them as “engineers”, but that is how they describe themselves.  And so it goes. They do many things that overlap traditional IT duties, but they do it for customers and not internal users.  I have always considered their work kind of sloppy and shoot-from-the-hip kind of stuff but if I am being truthful, I am more than a little biased.

This group is a particular nuisance to IT (and the rest of the company at large) as they are not what you would describe as “rule followers” nor “team players.”  They like to run their own shadow IT and such.  While I try to reign this in whenever I can, the CEO is not willing to draw the line and enforce the company rules and regulations on this group for some reason.  I’m not sure if it is just conflict avoidance or chasing the almighty dollar, but there is something preventing him from cracking down on them and enforcing the company policies.  

So I have made it clear, as the head of IT for the company, that as long as it doesn’t interfere with the rest of the company they may do so but we will not support these shenanigans in any way, shape, or form.  Once it crosses that line, I will stop it with prejudice.

Yesterday as I am sitting at my desk working on some super cool new thing I suddenly start getting in a tone of emails and Slack posts.  I look at the post and notice that our IPS/IDS system is just going nuts.  Port scan, port scan, port scan!!  All over one of my subnets one PC is running very intrusive port scans.

I identify the PC and then the user.  Naturally, it was one of these knuckleheads.

So I call up $User

$Me:  Hey, $User.

$User:  Hey.  What’s going on?

$Me:  I was going to ask you the same question.  Are you running any kind of network scans from your PC?

$User:  No.  No, I’m not.

$Me:  Are you sure?

$User:  Yeah, I’m sure.  Why?

$Me:  Well, we’re getting all kinds of bells and whistles going off on our IDS system that someone is running a scan on the network and the source is coming from your computer.

$User:  &lt;long pause&gt;  Umm….well, I am running a port scan right now.

$Me:  &lt;banging head against desk&gt; Well, then that would be a network scan now, wouldn’t it?

$User:  Yeah, I guess so.

$Me:  Well it needs to stop right now.  It is violating company policy.

$User:  Oh…okay.

Jesus….",Port Scan? I'm not running a stinking Port Scan.,0
"I'm part of a small tech support company supporting all kinds of small to medium businesses. This one happens to be a dentist.

The usual manager is on pregnancy leave and is usually a filter for the simple issues. So with this filter gone we have the receptionist acting as an impromptu manager with next to no IT knowledge. She calls in literally anything. And usually it's their dental software which is a mess on it's own. They'd probably be better of calling their supplier since they want specific settings changed.
Anyways, today it was a word issue.

They're taking in some patients from another practice and need to download/import some dental imagery. The other dentist sent them in a word file for some reason and the impromptu manager couldn't save them as .png or .jpeg which was needed to import them in their software.

Files downloaded from the internet or email tend to open in read-only view to protect you from macro's so the receptionist only needed to enable editing to save the images as .png
To be fair I get why a regular computer user could run into this. So I showed the receptionist to press the enable editing button in the yellow warning banner at the top of word and showed how to save them. As a service I even imported the first images for her to follow it all the way through.

For the next patient I let her do the thing telling her to ""Just repeat what I just did"" which wasn't complicated at all. Open word file &gt; enable editing &gt; save image to a folder &gt; press import in dental software &gt; select the newly saved file.

She managed to get to the second step. She ignored the yellow warning banner and tried to save immediately.
So I told her ""remember to press enable editing"".
I see her mouse pointer drift around somewhat and she presses the cross **NEXT TO** the editing button closing the banner and tries to save again...

Her: ""Why isn't it working?!""

Me: ""Let's just start from the beginning and press editing button and not the X""

She reopens the file. I see the pointer drift around again for a bit before she goes up. Up to the one button to fix it all. 

And... 

**AND...**

Presses the text explaining the read only setting on the other side of the button...

She clicked *everything but* the magic button.

I slowly move the pointer to the button myself disappointingly telling her ""No... This one...""",Just repeat after me,0
"First post! If on the wrong subreddit, please let me know, I'll post it somewhere more relevant.

**Context:** Not tech support, but I do player support for (game company), which means helping people with account management and other things that require interacting with tech.

The games that the company designs doesn't use passwords as such to log in; instead, when you try to log in to the game using (email), it sends an OTP to your email address. Of course, tons of things can go wrong in the process, usually (but not always) at the customer's end.

Up to this point though, the ticket has been standard business -- person opens a ticket (not live chat, no phone calls, thank god) and says they lost their account. I run through basic security questions, they pass, I connect the account to (email 1), and send them steps for recovering it, and close the ticket. Job done, right? NOPE.

**Cast: Me = Me, DK = dumb kid**

DK: \*reopens the issue\* ""I didn't receive the code""

Me: ""Ok, please show us a screenshot (confirming that you've written the right email)?""

DK: \*does so\*

Me: ""Ok, cool, and after you press ""Disconnected"", what happens next? Please show me?""

(Commence a lot of DK basically saying that they already lost two accounts and this is a waste of time)

DK: \*eventually shows me a screenshot; everything at our end works as intended\*

Me: ""Alright, in that case, can we try with another email address?""

DK: \*gives me 2 different emails, dumbus.kiddus &amp; gamer-over9000\*

Me: ""OK, which one do you prefer?""

DK: ""gamer-over9000, but  I forgot the password to it""

Me: \*sigh\* ""Right, and do you remember the password to ANY of the emails?""

DK: ""No""

\-- at this point, I realise that we can't help any further, and tell him accordingly; that without an email he can log in to, he won't be able to receive any OTPs and thus he can't log in to any of the accounts he has in our game.

I then instruct him to either reset/ask for new passwords for the emails, and/or create 3 new email accounts -- one per game -- before contacting us again, so that we can recover the game accounts for him.

Since that debacle happened, I've decided I will always, FIRST, ask people if they actually know the passwords to the emails they wish to use...

EDIT -- Update: Recovery successful! :) 

Evidently, they must've actually read my message, because they contacted us again and things are sorted now! Not all hope is lost!","""You must know the password for it to be able to use it as a login email...""",0
"***Backstory:***  A couple years back I worked at a small community based healthcare org. It was small enough that the entire IT dept was three people and a person who took care of the electronic health records system, wasn't really IT, just managed the software itself. It was near Christmas time so everyone was on vacation except myself and the software person to support the electronic records.

We had a particularly explosive doctor around that was known for yelling at staff etc. so of course we were told to treat this person with kid gloves.

***Cast: $Me = well me of course, $MD = Mad Doc***

&gt;$Me: Thanks for calling the help desk.. blah, blah, blah blah. How can I help you this morning?  
&gt;  
&gt;$MD: I'VE GOT PATIENTS THIS MORNING AND I CAN'T LOG INTO THE HEALTH RECORDS, LOG ME IN NOW!!!  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: What do you mean you can't login? Did you change your password recently? Does it not load? (Meanwhile doing some basic troubleshooting making sure server is up, etc.)  
&gt;  
&gt;$MD: I SAID LOG ME IN, I HAVE PATIENTS AND I CANNOT WAIT!!!!  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Sorry, but I cannot do that. I don't know your pass....  
&gt;  
&gt;$MD: WHAT DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND, LOG ME IN.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Sorry, but again I don't know your password. I'm going to transfer you to the software support person. Hopefully they can help. (I already knew they weren't there as they usually came in a hour after I so I knew to expect another call)

Few minutes later.. Like not even two or three minutes

&gt;$Me: Hey $MD did they not answer  
&gt;  
&gt;$MD: NO! And I said I need to login now to see my patients.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Again, I'm sorry I cannot help, I don't know your password  
&gt;  
&gt;$MD: I don't know why, you are tech support and I need to you log me in NOW! I make this company money and you spend it.. LOG ME IN!!!!

At this point $MD was once again forwarded back to the software support person, still knowing they hadn't come in yet. What transpired over the next half-hour or so was repeated calls to the help desk that were sent to the holding queue and forwarded to the software person.

When they came in and finally got the doc squared away came over to me and asked why they had multiple angry voicemails. The solution to it all.... The doc forgot the password for the records system he had changed the day before and the software person changed it and got him logged in.

For those who may ask, no, we in IT didn't have access to the software, just the servers it ran on.

***TL;DR:*** Doc forgot the password..","""I make the company money, you don't""",0
"Hey guys. Some of you might remember me from the stories of my former tech Ted.

This is not about Ted, though. Sorry.

This is a tale from back when I used to work on site. My boss sent me to check on a computer which wasn't loading Windows XP (I'm old, lol). The first level help desk was pretty useless there, so I didn't have much info to begin with. My boss also ""warned"" me that the user was a ""special"" one. I asked why and he started laughing, ""You'll see"".

So I get to the user's office and once I locate him, it's clear that I'm dealing with one of the most socially awkward guys I've ever met. A young guy dressed like one of those old men who spend the day watching construction work with their hands behind their backs, with a terrible body odor and even more terrible manners.

He starts explaining that his computer is not starting while I sit in front of his workstation. I power the pc on and it goes straight to the safe mode menu. So yeah, it's not loading, but we clearly have a case of, ""I can't even be bothered to read what's on my computer screen."" Meanwhile, the guy is babbling non stop about how he asked his father for a new computer because this one is not up to his standards and is clearly malfunctioning, he knows that because he uses computers a lot, bla bla bla, this is going to take long to fix, bla bla bla. I had gotten used to this kind of behaviour, since quite a few men assumed that they knew more about fxing computers than I did... so I just ignored him, but I noticed a lot of his coworkers staring at us (we were in an open space with a lot of people coming and going).

Oh and yes, his father. I'll get back to this later.

I turned the computer off, turned the keyboard upside down and slammed it on the table. A cascade of paper clips and dirt landed on the desk. The guy went silent. I turned the computer on and voilà, Windows XP is loading successfully. The guy's coworkers started snickering, as I explained that a paper clip had gotten stuck on the F8 key and was keeping it down, thus triggering the safe mode menu. 

Yes, I could have been less theatrical, but the guy had it coming. A few minutes later, while I was getting a drink from the vending machine, one of that guy's coworkers explained that he had gotten the job because his father was the manager of the whole division, that he was completely useless but liked to brag non stop about how he knew better than anyone. I apparently did what everyone in that office had been dreaming of doing since Useless Guy had been hired!

Soooooo satisfying.",My computer is clearly malfunctioning!,0
"Hello, I am not IT; my father used to be. He was ""Director of Technology"" for a large school district. He quit his job a few years back because he was underpaid, overworked, and hated his job (They ended up splitting his job in two and each new employee got what he was getting paid). Since today is my cake day and I wanted to give some funny stories back to you guys, I asked him what were some of the stupidest things he saw when he worked there. This one really stands out.  


A little more background: My dad, let's call him $D, works at a small middle school, and although his job isn't tech support for the district, he still helps troubleshoot any problems at that school. This story happened around the early 2000's. That day he got a call from an older lady who worked in his building, lets call her $S, that her keyboard wasn't working.

$D walks down to $S's office.

$D: So what's the problem?

$S: My keyboard isn't working! It won't do anything!

$D: Let me have a look.

He presses a bunch of the keys, no luck. Unplugs and re-plugs it back in, no luck. Other basic trouble shooting stuff.

$D: Was this keyboard working yesterday?

$S: Yes, it was.

$D: Did you spill anything on it?

$S: No, I haven't spilled anything on it!

$D: Are you sure nothing has touched this keyboard since when you left and when you came back? It's very unusual for equipment to stop working overnight.

$S: All I did was bring it home with me and wash it! It was very dirty.

$D: You... washed it?

$S: Yes, It was getting really grimy between the keys, so I washed it in the dishwasher.

$D: ...Okay, I'll go grab you another keyboard, just... don't wash them in your dishwasher. It's not good for the keyboard.

$S: Oh really? I'm sorry, I didn't know that! Hopefully you can get this keyboard working again so I don't get charged for it ahaha *wink*.

$D: haha, yeah...

He threw it in the trash right after he gave her a new one

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR nice older lady's keyboard is gross so she puts it in the dishwasher and doesn't understand why it doesn't work.

"I work for a fortune 1000 company, at a pretty self-regulating research site in the middle of nowhere. We deal with a lot of bleeding edge tech, but also a lot of really old stuff that needs to be maintained. Our team is split about 3:1 on bleeding-edge research and old system research.

And when I say old I mean OLD. Ancient 10/100 Cisco core equipment, terminal servers, mainframes, old Linux and Windows distributions, and hundreds of other servers, services, and systems that are just not designed to be secure.

Most of the old systems can’t use modern high-security protocols, like SSH with multi-factor auth, so we have a set of VPNs that connect to each research ‘sector’ (basically area of research).

A call comes in. A user is getting an odd error message when trying to log in, but he accidentally closes it before he can read it to me. I can already feel this is going to take a while.

He’s trying to access a middle-ground sector. Basically, you connect to this, then it allows you to pivot to other sectors under the same umbrella. The initial connection is extremely locked down, with triple-factor auth and presence detection, so if you leave your PC, the connection is closed. 

(It’s what the client paid us for, so that’s what we implemented. And no, I neither know nor care who that client is.)

His logins are being rejected, but with technical errors, not failed authentication.

“Throwaway, why does this keep saying it can’t establish the session?”

“Maybe we’re at max users, Developer. Let me check the VPN server.”

He’s one of five people on, so there’s no way we’re at capacity. I check his auth attempts. All were successful, but the sessions he just tried to establish aren’t there.

He tries again, and gets a new error message. “Address not reachable”. He can get to the greater internet, but can’t resolve our VPN’s IP?

“Developer, where are you?”

“Upstairs.”

Now I’m truly baffled. He’s unable to reach a static IP from inside the building? That should not be a problem. 

I look at the firewalls, both ours and the clients. Our firewall is registering the traffic flowing, but on the client’s firewall, a TON of attempts were blocked from INSIDE the network. From the network we use for VPNs.

I start worrying that he’s accidentally pivoting through someone else’s computer, if they accidentally turned on a WiFi hotspot.

Sure enough, there it is. Traffic coming through a VPN IP. That IP can be tied to a VPN client, so I can see whose PC I need to check.

I looked at the username and decided my face and desk should be together.

“Uh, Developer? Can you do me a favor?”

“Sure.”

“Can you try to access {Client’s internal systems} directly?”

“Don’t I need the VPN for that?”

“Yep.”

Rewind: Remember these?

&gt;He’s one of five people on, so there’s no way we’re at capacity.

&gt;Our firewall is registering the traffic flowing, but on the client’s firewall, a TON of attempts were blocked from INSIDE the network. From the network we use for VPNs.

He was already VPNed in. He was trying to start his VPN while already having a VPN connection.

We now have an additional step for VPN diagnostics; make sure they aren’t already VPNed in.

TL;DR: user can’t VPN into the system because they are already VPNed into the system

"I work for a small rural internet company, there's maybe 30 employees so we aren't capable of providing 24/7 customer care though we do have a rotating on call network team (this is somewhat irrelevant but there's nothing wrong with a bit of backstory). Earlier this year, I sent a mass email to all customers advising them of network maintenance between 2am and 3am. The following exchange happened maybe a month after this (C is customer, M is myself), this is also after we've already been speaking for 5 minutes 

C: Well one of your guys was meant to be out here a month ago and no one showed up!

I scan his account and see no open tickets, call logs or service visits since signing up with us. 

M: Sir, I don't see an appointment booked for your account. Can you recall who you booked this with? 

C: Let me just read out your own f**king email seen as you're so incompetent...

Cue him aggressively clicking to find the email 

C: Please be aware that during the ours of 2am and 3am we will be conducting network maintenance which may cause poor performance and service outages

He pauses as if waiting for the A-HA moment. I'm pausing thinking he must be messing with me. 

C: See! So where the f**k was he?

M: Where was who? 

C: The technician! I stayed up till 4am and he never showed! I deserve compensation for that alone, my time is worth big money

M: Sir the email you just read out in no way references a technician coming by your property, it was referring to network maintenance as in us conducting maintenance on the entire network

C: IT SAYS BETWEEN 2AM AND 3AM

M: Yes that was the time frame we anticipated the work to be done 

C: I don't need you to explain it to me. I'm smart, I have a BA!

"Being part of a Sunday tech support team in my job with an ISP normally means things are laid back (unless someone decides we are running overflow for other departments or there is an outage). That also means that there are only a small number of us staffed across several states.

Monique gets what seems like a normal call.  No internet connection.  She does the normal troubleshooting and advises the customer of her conclusion, that it is their equipment.  This the was customers answer to her:

To be fair, Brad would have been very nice about it.  He’s kind of your next door type of guy.  However given the facts even he would have said it was their equipment.

"This one was a while ago, but the persistence still astonishes me.

**The Cast:**  
$AL - Angry Lady  
$ME - Me  
$SW - Software in question  


So this lady had emailed our support box, she was having some periodic issues connecting to the internet, it'd work here and there but not all the time. Our company provides a few software products as well as general PC support based on the services your account has (aka. what you pay for). She'd been helped prior to emailing in and had been told at that time that $SW didn't cause the issue with her internet, but I think the first tech only went so far as having her do the work on the computer because we couldn't get connected. Since they only went that far, our superiors wanted do do more in-depth if we could.

I got assigned to create the ticket and reach out to her to do any additional troubleshooting we could to figure out the issue. I called her and the conversation went a little like this:

\[*insert normal pleasantries of beginning phone calls here*\]

$ME: So, we were just reaching out to see what other kinds of troubleshooting we can do to verify that $SW isn't causing the issue.

$AL: I'm certain it's $SW's fault! I didn't have this problem before I had $SW installed, and ever since then, I can't get on the internet sometimes.

$ME: Ok, well let's see if we can get connected to the computer with your permission and see what's going on.

*Her computer was being cooperative for a bit and allowing internet access so I was able to get remotely connected and take a look.*

$ME: So... from the looks of it, $SW has been installed since 6/10/19, and how long have you been having this issue?

$AL: It's been happening for the past two weeks! (*I called her sometime late July.*)

$ME: Ok, well, uhh, we can completely uninstall $SW, but I'll be honest here with you $AL, I don't think that it's causing or caused your issue. We installed $SW almost 2 months ago, and if its installation were to have caused you any problems, it would've almost certainly have provided you issues long before now. That isn't even including the fact that $SW doesn't really have anything that would cause you to have intermittent issues like this in the first place. 

\[*insert incredulity at the time gap, and questions about well if it's not you, what is it?!*\]

$ME: (*after doing a bit more looking*) I'm not exactly sure what the issue is since I can't quite see it while it's happening. I'd like for you to call back *while* the issue is present so we can do a bit more troubleshooting with multiple different methods of getting connected.

$AL: Ok, but I swear $SW is the reason this isn't working! Everything was ***just fine*** before I put this program on my computer.

$ME: ... again, $AL, you've had $SW on the computer long before your issues started. \~sigh Just give us a call at the time of the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

She called back and spoke with a different tech who, regardless trying any method, was unable to get connected. I'm thinking her Network Adapter or something was failing :shrug:  


TL;DR: Lady had an issue she was super insistent was because she installed $SW, despite her issue not being present until recently and $SW having been on the computer for months. Even after having this pointed out among other reasons this wouldn't be the case, continues to blame $SW many many times throughout a phone call.","""I'm absolutely positive it's because of your software!!""",0
"I work for a fortune 1000 company, in a middle-of-nowhere research office. We have very few employees, and very few ties to HQ. We basically do what we want, as long as we’re compliant and secure. 

Corporate has a standard Windows image, but it’s FAR to locked down for research purposes, and we have people working on tools for other platforms. In the past, we had Mac and Windows images, but I was hired to create a Linux image with the same feature parity; encrypted disks, no split-tunnels, locked down hardware, hardware tokens for network auth, locally-cached user credentials, etc. This will be important later.

Come Monday. We get a new hire, Keith. Keith is a hotshot, straight-from-college developer. He’s smart and he knows it. His ego fills whatever room he’s in. This is his first job ever, after graduating from [Very Prestigious University]. He is Very Smart.

So it comes time for him to get his new computer. He demands Linux. I shrug and grab him a Linux imaged laptop. 

He fake gags when he sees the Ubuntu startup screen. “Why not use a real OS like Arch?”

Oh boy. This ones going to be fun.

When I’ve finished walking him through setup, with him griping and complaining about everything from the window manager to user logins, I hand him back off to HR to go through orientation.

I turned to my coworker, and tell her “I give him three days to break it.”

Two days later;

I get a call from him, saying his system isn’t connecting to the Research VPN. Oddly, he doesn’t complain about his “crappy os” or how “bad it is”. I instantly guess what he’s done, but need to confirm it first.

I have him send me his error log, and immediately confirms my suspicions. “OpenVPN on Arch Linux blah”. 

He had reinstalled his OS. He was no longer on a compliant device.

“Where are you? I’ll need to do some manual intervention.”

Kieth: “Upstairs in the Developer room.”

I contact our Security Officer and we head over to Keith. Keith is then escorted to another room while his laptop is confiscated.

Oh by the way, he was working in a room full of people working on extraordinarily sensitive materiel for our company, on contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

And he had just brought a modified, unsecured device into the center of that room.

After an hour of copying his drive, then booting up the copy, then taking three seconds and one additional line of text to break in (single-user mode is a thing people), I could start looking at the damage.

And oh boy there was a lot of it.

The OpenVPN error was that a script was unable to run. However, he had removed said script, and commented it out in the config file. He couldn’t copy it because on the compliant systems, that script couldn’t be read by anyone but root. He couldn’t become root because he couldn’t sudo, he couldn’t enter single user due to boot menu protection, and he couldn’t access the disk because of a mix of hardware- and software-based encryption.

That script checked that a system was compliant, re-routed internet access through a proxy, prepped firewall rules to deny incoming connections, then connected through to the R&amp;D networks that user was allowed to access, based on what contracts they were on.

Before he reinstalled, the system was logging to our local servers. There were several minor security alerts where he had tried to sudo up to root, or somehow become root. We usually ignored them because 99% of people accidentally would type commands for their R&amp;D systems into the local console, not realizing. Any large, systematic incidents would be caught by the SIEM and reported.

Going through the hardware’s logs though, I saw that he had tried to root his Ubuntu image massively. He had wiped the BIOS, presumably to allow USB booting, then wiped the TPM. This prevented him from accessing the encrypted partition at all. After that, he had reinstalled.

However, the fact that he was even able to connect to the network on a non-compliant machine concerned us, since we had an 802.1x profile for the switch ports.

It turned out it was misconfigured, and was only checking MACs for several ports. So at least he helped us find that error.

After a very, very stern talking to, and a slap on the wrist, he was let back in, humbled and a lot more aware of not wiping his laptop. He was given a Windows machine, and we’ll see next Monday if the slap on the wrist worked, or he’ll need a boot out the door.

The funniest part is that these systems are supposed to be remote access to the R&amp;D network, where you can use whatever OS your heart desires as your remote-access workstation. If only he had known.

TL;DR: “I use Arch, btw” user complains about, then wipes his Ubuntu system. Compliance requirements then smack him in the face. User’s ego is deflated, and a tiny little security hole is found and patched. Yay.","An extremely Smart, Knowledgeable, and Irritating User vs. a Compliant Linux Image",0

**Me:** Okay, lets say that I make this new account for you. Now you load up the web page and it's white. How can you log in if it's still white?

**Mr X:** Look you're not understanding. That last person was terrific and we went through all of the things we could do. I was on the phone for over an hour with him and the only option we have left is making a new account.

*(I can actually see how long he was on the last call for and it def was not an hour lol)*

**Me:** Just curious, how are you accessing the website? Walk me through how you would get to it.

*(Now I'm thinking it's bad cookies or something, we did recently update the website)*

**Mr X:** well i'm not good with computer things, so to make things easier my son has the web page on my desktop so I only have to click on that.

ok.

So it turns out it wasn't just a shortcut but a html file that they had saved some months earlier. I wish I could have gone further, I was trying to get Mr X to load the web page in a different browser by typing it out. But they only wanted a new acc which is against ToS so I advised can't make a new one, and they ended the call.

tl;dr get transferred a customer to 'just create a new acc'. they not only have an acc already but for some reason think making a new one will make our web page load.",Customer thinks making a new account will help load our webpage,0
"This story takes place this past thursday.

As part of an annual sports event in the company I am currently interning in, me and another intern made a small website to track the run distance of our willing coworkers (aka basically everyone that is not in IT, shockingly enough). At the very top of the page,  there is a big warning that says the logging function will only be enabled during the night from thursday to friday.

9AM, I roll into work, cursing traffic jams in seven different languages simultaneously, and am immediately greeted by a dozen of messages from someone in marketing, that while not outright hostile, I can tell are seeping with anger. Before answering, I take a look at my mails and see a company-wide notice announcing the website to be live (predictably, it's not, and was never planned to be), followed by a chain of mails that is far too long to have been produced in the span of an hour (we open shop at 8). Guess who's the one who wrote the announcement in the first place.

I open up the IM client and just as I start typing my response, I get a call from the marketing guy. I shall be $Me, and he shall be $Marketing in the following conversation.

$Me: H'lo ?  
$Marketing: Why is the website not working ?  
$Me: It ain't supposed to be. Says so on the front page: ""You will only be able to log your data starting friday at midnight""  
$Marketing: It's thursday ! Why isn't it working yet ?  
$Me, *probably audibly confused*: Because friday comes after thursday ? (*Note: at this point the remainder of the open space is rolling on the floor laughing, and it takes every fiber of my being to not join them*)  
$Marketing: *You* said it would go live in the night between thursday and friday !  
$Me: I did.  
$Marketing: Why isn't it live then ?!  
$Me: It's not friday yet.  
&lt;Cue a few repeats of this with the marketing guy becoming increasingly angry&gt;  
$Me: The event starts tomorrow at midnight, there is literally no point in enabling data collection before it even starts, this'll just skew the dataset.  
$Marketing: That makes no sense ! Why would the company start an event on a saturday ?  
$Me, *internally*: `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`  
$Me, *externally*: ...You know that days start at midnight and end at 23:59:59, right ? (*cue the peanut gallery going wild again*)  
$Marketing: Forget it, I'll talk to &lt;head of IT&gt;. He'll help me, unlike some low level intern.  
$Me: Sure thing.

Rather unsurprisingly, my boss basically (and intentionally) repeated my words to $Marketing, until they apparently got through. 15 minutes after the end of their chat, a new company-wide announcement popped into our inboxes, proclaiming that due to a scheduling error, the website would only go fully live tomorrow.",User does not understand how time works,0

Anyway, let's call him $Kev rolls into work swearing to high heavens about how he had just been pulled over by police and given a substantial fine regarding his registration (and thus insurance) being lapsed.

He was standing there cursing us all to high heavens, cursing the police, the rego department, anyone that he felt his anger should be directed to.

I look at him and say ""But don't you have a mobile phone?""

$Kev: Yes

$Me: So....you have an email address?

$Kev: Yes

$Me: So you would have gotten an email about your rego?

$Kev: I get heaps of emails a day, I can't read them all

$Me: So you can't search? Here, give me your phone

*I then proceed to show him how to search, here is his rego renewal from 12 weeks prior, these are sent 6 weeks in advance mind you...*

$Me: Here, all these spam emails you see....

$Kev: Yes

$Me: Highlight them, like this, click these dots, say they are Spam, and then run your inbox through that filter like so

*I do this for him, his inbox goes from 999+ Emails to only about 150 emails unread*

$Kev: Yeah, but I still need to be reminded when my rego is due

$Me: That's why you have a calendar app

$Kev: A Calendar?

*I show him the calendar*

$Kev: That's awesome, so I can save all my stuff in the calendar?

$Me: Yes

$Kev: And I can set reminders to whenever I need them in advance?

so at a Christmas gathering a uncle complains about his laptop running hot and occasionally crashing

thinking the fans had lost power or broke, i took the back off and was greeted by a considerable amount of roach corpses , and some living ones.

now this was a big, bulky 2000s era dell machine, so they had a lot of space to populate. he had left it lying on the floor in a corner for almost 10 months, and these roaches had thought it would be a nice place to settle. he had pulled it out and turned it on to find some old vacation pics, and the roaches freaked, and began to run around. some had got fallen into and been killed by the fans, jamming them, and others had become stuck in the air vents, blocking the hot air from exiting the chassis and roasting them alive. it smelled horrible and looked like something out of a B-grade horror flick.

when Uncle saw it he said he needed files from the drive, meaning, much to my horror, i would have to pull out the drive from this horrifying machine so i could pull the files onto my PC with a USB-to-SATA cable. after pulling on the thickest gloves i could find, i went in to unplug it. when i had got it out a half-alive roach underneath it flew at me and landed on my shoulder, causing a full-body spasm trying to get the thing off me (i live in Australia, where the roaches can not only fly in short bursts but also have massive grasshopper legs). after this, i had to clean a massive amount of Roach Gunk off the drive, which felt somehow soft and squelchy but also full of hard shell. after getting the files he needed, i immediately threw that thing in the trash, and gassed my entire room with bugspray to kill any escapists.

"Hi! I'm back!

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/d1y6cc/dialing_phones_for_users_is_now_its_responsibility/) for ease of access.

I'm providing more backstory of a ""normal"" work week so that you understand what is going on.

We're in the middle of an ongoing technology refresh among over a dozen buildings over 50+ acres (actually, I recently found out it's closer to 1900 endpoints).

Again, there's only two of us, and when someone has a helpdesk request, since we're either doing provisioning, network administration, or something else, most of the time they call for site security to sweep the halls of the buildings, and security physically escorts us to the user having the issue.

So, 10 to 20 times a day, I'll try to do a deployment, or work in a distribution frame, and I'll hear radio chatter behind me and a ""GOT 'IM!"" and sometimes be led, by the arm, to buildings a 10 minute walk away.

Such reasons for being ""escorted"" this week have been:

1. User forgot where the ""enter"" key was
2. User forgot password (written in front of them on a post-it note, I pointed it out then wagged my finger)
3. A pencil sharpener wasn't working (needed plugged in)
4. User didn't understand how to plug in a USB drive
5. User having issue with air conditioning unit. (after the 12 minute escort, Informed user I was IT, not facilities.)

In addition to this, we get scheduled to meetings both as ""standby"" and participant (sometimes double booked, as mentioned in previous posts). ""Standby"" is where we are summoned and requested to stay whenever there is technology involved (Video conferences, WebExes, Skype calls) because the managers ""need"" IT to be in the room with them in case something happens.

As such, the past 2 days, about 8 hours each day has been dedicated to being present in these meetings. This happens sometimes; it was an administratively meeting-heavy week. If we try to duck from these meetings, cue the security sweep and escort. Learned that one the hard way.

Director of our department ($D1 from previous story) has been asking for updates regarding the deployment of new units and a status report on how many old units remain across over a dozen+ building complex.

Our network itself is locked down by our governing body; I previously informed $D1 we have no access to sweep the network across this sprawling site (with my bit of infosec background, I tried things like nmap scans and nse scripts).

So here we go, into today's story.

$D1 calls me into their office and asks me to shut the door.

$D1: ""How many units were deployed the past two days?""

Me: ""We were scheduled as standby for \[Meeting1, Meeting2, Meeting3..\] both days.""

$D1: ""And where is the status report I asked for on the outstanding endpoints?""

Me: ""We have not been able to physically go around to all of the sites. We were scheduled for these meetings, and escorted for various helpdesk requests. I CC'd you on all of the tickets generated.""

$D1: ""$pukeforest, I get the feeling you are **deliberately disobeying** my requests.""

Me: ""As I mentioned, we are requested to be in multiple places at once. What you are asking for is physically impossible right now.""

$D1: *now yelling* ""I **EXPLICITLY** asked you to **COMPLETE THIS REPORT!!!**""

Me: ""How can I walk around the site, inventorying units while scheduled to standby in conference rooms AND deploying units AND being escorted around for non-IT issues?""

*$D1 stares at me with the intensity that I just insulted their family*

Me: *pleading* ""Can someone else please just be trusted to set up conferences and WebExes?""

$D1: ""**BUT. YOU. ARE. I.T.!!**""

Me: ""Could we get area managers to report back how many old units are in their locations? I'm just trying to offer solutions so that we can execute on schedule.""

$D1: *seething* ""Leave. My. Office. **NOW.**""

A few minutes later, get a call from HR, requesting I meet with them. On my way to HR, I hear another ""GOT HIM!"" and was, again, escorted by security to a user 3 buildings away.

Issue: A monitor was turned off. A simple power button press fixed it.

Finally, in HR's office, I am presented with a written warning for multiple accounts of ""insubordination"", along with a ""Day of Reflection"" (one day suspension without pay).

I refused to sign off.

I was told to see $D1 after reading my warning. So, I return to $D1's office.

$D1: ""$pukeforest, I think you understand why we had to do this. I don't like having to take disciplinary action.""

Me: ""actually, I don't understand at all.""

$D1: ""well, now you have an extra day to think about it. And I expect that report first thing on your return.""

Me: ""That's not possible. I have to be here physically to inventory the site.""

$D1: ""You are dismissed.""

I stood up, thanked $D1 for their time, and walked out.

I placed my keys, ID card, and fob on my desk, took all personal items with me.

I then left the site. I still had an hour left in the day. Didn't even clock out.

I've been really nervous posting all of this.

I just want this entire situation to go away, and to have a normal job in IT again. I just wanted to be an information security guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't return to homelessness.

It was such a long climb back.

I'm eyeing my assets and seeing how long I can hold it down.

&amp;#x200B;

But hey, at least I have a CISSP this time.

And several awesome members of this community have reached out to offer assistance. Friendship, guidance, job leads, you name it. That is infinitely more than I had before.

I have hope that this will all be alright in the end. That changes everything.

We'll get there.

I believe.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT/UPDATE

Oh man, this could not have been better timed.

Site-wide network outage prompts $D1 to call me the AM after.

&amp;#x200B;

$D1: ""we're experiencing a site-wide outage. I need you to come in and find the problem.""

Me: ""I'm currently suspended without pay per your orders.""

$D1: ""I understand, but you either come in or you're fired.""

Me: ""Okay..?""

$D1: ""So are you coming in?""

&amp;#x200B;

I took a long pause to think about how I worded this.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""No, I don't think I will. If you go into my office, you will notice all of my (company)-issued things are already on my desk.""

&amp;#x200B;

$D1: "" ..... ""

"This took place during my first week of L2 support for a major telecom, I was in mobile. For those of you who haven't had the pleasure, L2 is... not for the faint of heart. Majority of callers are pissed off, (sometimes rightly so) frustrated people who just want to get off the phone by this point. 

I had multiple people send me letters and treats as an L1 (security would let people send them in and pass them on, and no-one ever poisoned me, yay!). L2, not so much...

Step #1, do EVERYTHING L1 did over before further troubleshooting. Goes over like a turd in a punch bowl. Sadly, a lot of the time, it WAS something simple and this does do it, but it really brings on the hate.

So I'm almost halfway through my shift (1pm GMT-8) when my system populates an account that should **NOT** be on my system.

It's split into several records because of the sheer number of lines. The monthly charges are astronomical. It's a very recognizable world class corporation.

\*beep\*

me: *greeting*, *verification requests.*

In my head, red flags are flying, alarms are blaring. This kind of account should NEVER have been routed to me.

I immediately flag down someone to my desk to go figure out what the hell is going on and what to do. Meanwhile, I'm going through account verification, and I ask for a moment to read through the notes. There are a lot of notes. Reading them, it has all sorts of things on it that say ""DO NOT TOUCH THIS ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU ARE XXX"" (hint: I'm not XXX)

Word comes back to apologize for the missed transfer, and to very politely transfer her to where she belongs or offer a supervisor to assist.

She ***declines*** the transfer, says I will do just fine. (she's very polite)

Management says do what she says, she says jump this high, jump TWICE that. Handling time is irrelevant. **HANDLE WITH MAXIMUM COURTESY.**

Me: O.O'

I cannot remember this womans name, but she was a machine. A glorious machine.

4 hours. That's how long this call lasted.

We took our lunches together. I left my headset live and system still logged in, and she took hers at the same time then we continued.

New activations, deactivations, number swaps, notations for porting, feature additions and removals, plan changes, troubleshooting remote devices and devices she has in hand, testing network functionality at so many sites. EVERYTHING. Everything is also meticulously notated. 

I can't even tell you how many lines I serviced. She was a pleasure to speak to the whole time. Funny, kind and patient. I don't think I ever had to repeat myself giving directions on a single device. I think I might love her. By the end, we've chatted about just about everything under the sun while I'm performing whatever is needed on each line. And she's lovely the whole time.

So after trudging through this, we finally get down to the one thing I have no access to. The warranty systems. It's now about 4:52pm.

I connect to the warranty department and go through the whole list (notes and IMEI). I'm required to tell this guy pretty much everything he's going to be doing, so he NEVER has to ask questions of the customer. It takes a while. By about 5:02pm I've reached the end of my baton passing duties and I tell him I'm going to pass her through.

I switch back to LCL (lovely corporate lady). 

CS: Ok LCL, I've got xxx on the line with the warranty department, he's all clued in and you should be good to go. Is there anything else before I hand you over?

LCL: No CS, you've been great. Thanks for everything, I'll pass along a good note for you.

Now. As she is about halfway through that sentence, the world ended.

**THE WARRANTY LINE DISCONNECTS**

I'm staring at the system in shock, and I **KNOW** what has happened. And I, am completely screwed.

CS (in my head): HOLY SHIT! Uh.. Uh... \*frantic thinking\* I can play this off.

CS: Well LCL, I'm not quite sure what happened, but I'm afraid I've lost the line to the warranty department.

Now the **big** problem with this is there IS no direct line to warranty, you have to transfer through the IVR, and it shuts down automatically at 5pm, no bypass.

LCL: Excuse me? What happened?

CS: Well, I'm afraid I've lost connection to the warranty department and being after 5, I don't have a way to get you through until tomorrow when they reopen. I'm really sorry about this.

LCL goes **dead** silent.

LCL: ...

LCL: You don't need to make up excuses. I'm quite *intimately* familiar with those systems and I *know* what happened. 

CS: I'm sorry....

LCL: It's not your fault, you did fine. Notate the account for port out.

At this point I think my heart actually seized for a second. My eyes were probably about to pop out of my skull. I probably took a full 3 seconds to respond.

CS: I'm sorry?!

LCL: Just do it. I pay far to much to deal with this s\*\*t. I have nothing against you. Notate the account I will be porting out to XXX.

At this point I am losing my s\*\*t. You do NOT do this to this kind of account. Any kind of cancellation, port out request, MUST be handled through a different department by protocol. One where they will bend over backwards to do anything to keep you. It's ALL OVER the notations.

Don't get me wrong, I have the capability. But not the authorization.

I tell her I **need** to transfer her.

**She declines.**

LCL: Just notate the account please.

So I do so. Heart pounding like crazy, pretty sure I was shaking.

CS: It's done, again I'm really sorry.

LCL: Stop apologizing. You have a good night.

CS: You too LCL.

At this point I'm sweating, heart still pounding. Disconnected my set, logged off. It's about 5:30pm at this point. I couldn't even find anyone to tell about what was going to happen. I went home.

The next day I get to work and am immediately flagged by security at entry and pulled to the side.

A few minutes later, I'm greeted by the union rep, not a good sign. He explains to me that he will be there to back me up during the interview.

What interview? The one I had to give in front of a panel of executives and HR. I recognized a few of them from the pictures on the walls in the call center. Any guesses what it was about?

I was grilled for about half an hour about the contents of that call and what happened. Repeatedly. At the end of it all, after all the questions were done, the lead exec (LE) looks at me.

LE: So you are aware, the other party involved has already been terminated.... LCL clearly stated that there would be no chance at salvaging this if you were let go. You've got an angel on your side.

Then they sent me back to work.

A few days later, my system throws a security flag when I try to log on. I need to report to the security desk. I'm totally ready for them to take my badge and escort me out, it's over.

No. There is a delivery they just cleared, waiting for me.

LCL sent me chocolates and a thank you card, really nice ones.","The terrors of the IVR, or, What a nice lady!",0

*I'm a developer, but I didn't get into it by the typical route. I had no interest in computers, other than to browse the internet on the magic box, as I was growing up. I studied maths at university, but to my surprise, in some of the courses I was introduced to the very rudiments of programming. I didn't like it much at first.*

*After graduating however, after failing a few attempts to be hired as a trainee accountant (for which I am eternally thankful) I got myself hired as a trainee software developer. I had a lot of catching up to do and still have a few gaps in my knowledge, but I believe I'm a pretty decent dev.*

My desk phone rang. A somewhat unusual occurrence, and 99% of the time when it does it's our receptionist wanting to transfer a call from the front desk. I was somewhat surprised that the call was coming from one of our meeting rooms.

It was my project manager, $cheerful.

&gt;$cheerful: Hey, $cyborg\_ninja\_cat, can you pop over to $meetingRoom? We need your mathematical expertise.

Intrigued, I grabbed a pencil and the back of an envelope and toddled on over to where $cheerful and $workaholic, my lead dev, were poring over a laptop screen.

&gt;$workaholic: Hey $cyborg\_ninja\_cat! So if there's a price of £13 and we multiply it by 0.8 we get £10.40. And if we divide it by 1.2 instead we get £10.83.

These things are true. I scribble the figures down as I wait for the rest of the explanation, which is not forthcoming.

&gt;$cyborg\_ninja\_cat: ...yeah, those would give you different answers.

Light slowly dawns:

&gt;$cyborg\_ninja\_cat: ...so, you're trying to remove VAT?  
&gt;  
&gt;$cheerful: yes.

VAT, for the uninitiated, is essentially British sales tax. At the time of writing it stands at 20% for the majority of goods and services to which it is applicable. It's much more common to need to *add* VAT, and nearly everyone understands why you multiply the pre-VAT price by 1.2.

I think about it and scribble down a few more numbers, to check my intuition. Percentages can be tricky beasts.

&gt;$cyborg\_ninja\_cat: Dividing by 1.2 is correct. VAT is 20% of the pre-VAT price, and if you multiply by 0.8, you're taking off 20% of the *post-VAT* price, which is more.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently, a customer for whom we built an eCommerce website last year complained that certain VAT calculations were incorrect, and it turns out that it's our in-house platform that's getting it wrong and needs to be fixed ASAP.

I nearly died when I saw the resulting Slack conversation about it:

&gt;$cheerful: Yes, $cyborg\_ninja\_cat the mathematician really came into force there. Real team rally moment.

I work onsite as a network admin/technical support/support for everything that has power for a rather small business with about 200 employees.

&amp;#x200B;

And now the story. U = user, IT=me

It was early in the morning and I was remotely supervising one of our offsite PC where some other IT specialist from another firm was installing some software and I had to watch and enter the admin password whenever he needed.

U: Hello IT, my computer doesn't start.

IT: Alright, does it make any sound or are there any leds that light up when you try to start it up?

U: No, it's just dead.

IT: Does your monitor work? Does it's led light up?

U: Yes, the monitor just says ""No signal""

IT: Can you check if the power cable is connected on both ends?

U: Yes, it is.

\*\*\* I knew she didn't check because it was too fast and she is a very lazy and uncooperative person.

IT: Can you check again please?

IT: Sorry, I am engaged in a remote support session right now and can't come. If you can wait half an hour I can come to you then.

IT: Let's try something else. Try and use the power cable from your monitor to power the PC. If it's a bad cable, you can just come down and get another one.

U: \*Mumbled swearing\* Alright, hang on.

U: No, still nothing.

\*\*\*Now i just think it may be a faulty power supply or something else

IT: Ok, I need to look at your PC, I will come down in half an hour.

U: I told you I have work to do, can I bring it up to you?

IT: You can but I will not be looking at it for another half an hour, as I told you, I am engaged in another support session.

U: \*Grunts\*, Can't you just put that on hold? I really need to get \*bla bla bla some shit about a client\* done.

IT: Nope, I will come down in half an hour.

U: Ok! \*slams the phone\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Half an hour later I go down there with a power cable and a power supply.

IT: Hey, let me see what's wrong with it.

U: Finally! \*she backs of and starts talking to a colleague\*

IT: Pressing the power button. Computer starts up.

U: What? I swear I did the same thing, what have you done to it?

IT: Nothing, just pressed the power button.

IT: Here, let's just shut it down and you do it so we know everything is alright.

U: Alright. \*shuts down computer\*

&amp;#x200B;

She then reaches under the desk (the pc is rather in deep under it) and presses a button. Which button you ask? Well let me tell you.

The computer is a HP SFF 6300 and the power button is flushed (not recessed or risen) with the case and doesn't stand out as a power button.

But she wasn't pressing it, o no, her hand was higher up on the damn DVD Player button.

I was about to face palm but decided it was best not to.

U: See, it doesn't work!

IT: Do you know what button are you pressing?

U: Yes, the POWER button.

IT: No, that is the DVD burner button.

Laughter ensues in the room.

IT: Is this a new computer? I don't remember changing your station recently.

U: No, I had this for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I said good day and left, no thanks, no nothing, she just set herself ashamed on the computer and started ""working"".

I do not understand this person. I checked and  she had the same pc for over 6 months and she just decided that day that the way to power on the PC is with the bloody DVD burner button.

&amp;#x200B;

She is without a doubt the most difficult user I've been working with.

"This happened somewhat recently and still makes me chuckle and facepalm simultaneously. Healthcare is a very interesting area of IT to work in and makes me question how some people managed to graduate from high school, let alone university. Good times. 

I was asked by HR to retrieve a color printer that was taken from another clinic location during a move. This specific printer was costing the company thousands of dollars just for toner and needed to be replaced with a basic black and white printer. Once I arrived onsite, the following transpired:

Me = Me

K = Karen (definitely a Karen)

Me: “Hi K. I was sent here to replace the large color printer and install this newer, more compact black and white printer.”

K: *gets very agitated* “WHAT!? WHY!?”

Me: “HR has requested that we swap printers out” 

K: *getting increasingly angrier* “But we need this! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!? I’m going to talk with HR Director” *has HR Director’s phone number and starts tapping furiously*

Me: ..............

K: *lets out a shrill reeeee after texting* “I can’t believe she’s taking away our printer! How are we going to print out these decorations!? Our patients love these!”

Me: “alright new printer has been installed. Test page ca—“.

K: “WE DON’T EVEN GET AN ADULT PRINTER!? IT’s TOO SMALL!” 

Me: “This is the standard printer for our front desk staff”. 

K: “F-Fine! Whatever. I can’t believe you’re taking this away from us”. 

Me: “Have a nice day!” 

TLDR: HR asks me to get rid of a color printer a particular front desk staff member was “secretly” hoarding for arts and crafts, gets mad and texts HR director only to be told it’s gotta go. User gets pissed because now she can’t play with arts and crafts to decorate the front desk area.

Edit 2: The HR Director also handles corporate finances. Odd yes, but that’s how it is. No idea why.

Edit 4: I saw Karen today as I walked in for a different issue elsewhere in the building; she is still scheming up a plan to get her printer back.",But We Need This! WHY Are You Doing This!?,0
"Short one.

Had a client drop off a dell optiplex from probably 2012. Says it doesn't turn on. I assume it's probably a PSU issue, but I say I'll test it out and get back to him in a day or so.

Sadly, my test PSU has been stolen by someone, so I call the guy and leave a message explaining that it's probably the PSU, but I'd need to order a new one to actually find out, leave him with the ol\` ""It'll be $price price for the new power supply, but if it doesn't work out, don't worry about it"". I say that I won't order it without the go-ahead from him, so I'll need him to call me back""

A few days pass.

I come back in about 4 days later, the PC in question has been moved from the repair bench onto the ""Incoming"" bench. Perplexed , I take a look. New work order on it. The guy had apparently heard my message, didn't understand it, but then came in to pick it up, only to be surprised when he got it home and it was still broken.

I call him again. Another voicemail, I explain what needs to be done, again.

about another 4 days pass.

He comes in, this time I am there to greet him. 

I now, explain, for a 3rd time. That it's still broken, and I need his go-ahead to buy the PSU since it will probably cost something like $60 for the PSU and then $70 for our labor. 

He stares at me. A blank, unknowing look in his eyes.

I stare back, my dead soulless eyes, vacant of any hint of emotion, piercing into his vessel.

He looks away, and asks:

""So, it's not done yet?""

"I work for a B2B software company and occasionally I field support calls. Details have been obscured/changed to protect the innocent.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been working to troubleshoot an issue a $Client was having with our software. The issue had 2 parts:

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a couple of days of asking for examples, but eventually the $Client provided what I was asking for and I determined the first part was related to \~30 missing users. I added them to the system and alerted the $Client.

&amp;#x200B;

The second part involved the software trying to validate against the wrong set of accounts. After some investigation, I determined that the only way to change which set of accounts the software is validating against is a setting on the physical device at the client's location. This setting absolutely cannot be changed by us. I confirmed the issue against our system logs, then called the $Client to instruct them on how to correct the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: ""Hey $Client. So we found the issue. On your device, you'll need to hit the \[toggle\] button. From there...""

$Client: ""WHAT!?! NO! THERE IS NO \[TOGGLE\] BUTTON! Listen here $Me, we've been using this system for 2 years and this is the first time this has happened. We didn't do anything different than we have done for the last couple years. Clearly when you did this year's configuration recently you screwed something up and it's not working now. I have my client chewing my butt out and I have about 200 end-users who can't validate. They are all standing in front of me right now waiting for this to be resolved. There's no way we messed this up; this is on you.""

$Me: ""$Client, I get it. I would be just as frustrated if I had 200 end-users angrily staring me down. So looking on my end, I can see the validation attempts. I can see where they originated from and which set of accounts they are attempting to validate against. I'm looking at this right now. I don't know what happened or who did what, but I do know what is in front of me. We need to get the software pointed at the right set of accounts. The \[toggle\] button should be right at the top of the main screen. If you can't find it, call \[the hardware vendor\]. Your company gets priority support so make sure to take advantage of it.""

$Client: ""At the top right of the screen?""

$Me: ""The top of the screen. I don't have the hardware in front of me so I'm not positive on the exact layout. The vend...""

$Client: ""It's not there! It's never been there. There has never been a button to switch the accounts. We have always validated against the same set of accounts. If we ever needed to validate against the other accounts, we would have to manually select them for that specific user each time. My client is starting at me about to chew me out again. This issue has been ongoing for 5 days now. You clearly made a mistake. This is effecting my client and all of their end-users. We have been manually tracking this on a piece of paper. I need you to fix this right now. It doesn't matter how you do it, but I need it done. We don't even have the ability to... there's the \[toggle\] button. I pressed it. I think it's working now.""

$Me: ""Ok, great! Anything else I can help with?""

$Client: ""Well, some users still aren't able to validate at all! It's been happening every day! I'm going to start sending you every example of when this happens. There must be at least 20 end-users who can't validate at all, no matter what. We just can't keep having these issues!""

$Me: ""Ah, I believe that was related to the missing users I added this morning, but please let me know if you have more trouble.""

"This is going to be a pretty short story but one me and my co-workers died laughing over. For some background, I am a undergrad student working as a general IT guy (I do everything from help desk to setting up switches and servers). When I was hired, I mainly did support at company HQ,over the past few months I started to support some of the smaller satellite offices.

Cut to last week when I was in remote office with a to do list of general maintenance items. One of those items was to move a workstation employees would use to remote into out of the cubicle area over to a copy room to make room for a new hire. I worked closely with a department head on this to make sure they knew where this computer was going to be moved to, so on and so forth.

The NEXT day, I am back at company HQ and all of IT is getting emails that a workstation was stolen from right under our noses. Copied on these emails was of course a distribution group that included everyone in the remote office. Needless to say there was panic and crazed people trying to figure if anything else was stolen. It didn't take long for us to find out this all started when the department head started emailing people saying the remote workstation (you know the one) had been stolen. In the span of 12 hours this absolute genius of an engineer had completely forgotten that HE wanted me to move the remote workstation. Needless to say it took hours for people to finally get it in their heads that there was no robbery.",A Computer Was Stolen!!,0

&gt;$me: OK, let me connect to your machine.

&gt;$me: So from what I can see the headset isn't connected and it isn't picking it up. Can you please check it's plugged in?

&gt;$tm: I'm not stupid it's definitely plugged in. I've tried a different plug and everything. 

&gt;$me: Ok well the software isn't recognising the headset and neither is the playback device area. Has the headset ever worked?

&gt;$tm: Yes it works fine it's just intermittent. It's a brand new headset.

&gt;$me: Ok well because it isn't working we'll send a tech on over to take a look.

So, I had to ask a tech to go on-site to check her headset out which I hate to do because it's normally a simple plug in. Lo and behold, the USB cable is not plugged in. The user then tells the tech that they 'most definitely had it plugged in'.

"This happened about 15 years ago when I first started working, but was reminded of the story when I went to my former manager's retirement lunch this week. 

When I first started working I was a junior on-site IT analyst at regional sales office for a medical supplies company.  We had a mix of marketing, sales, and field support in the office.  There was a guy who was in field support who looked very close to Doc from Back to the future and was always tinkering away in the lab, but he also had an office with a desk, PC, and phone in it.  

I come in one morning and check the voicemails on our tech line and he left a voicemail stating that he would like a new computer put into the lab.  I asked my manager and he asked me to find out why he needed a computer in the lab and in his office and to ask if we could replace his PC in his office with a laptop and docking station.  So I walked down to the lab and there he was tinkering away with parts for medical devices.  I approached him and told him I was here to follow up on his request for a secondary computer and asked him some questions.  

He turns around and shuts the door to the lab and invites me to sit down.  And proceeds to tell me the he believes there is a ghost in his computer in his office because it randomly shuts down while he's working on it.  I start to interject and tell him that I think it might be a bad fan because we just fixed a few of those and it was the same model he had.  

He held his hand up and said, no it's not bad fan.  He went on to explain that he believed his dead wife was haunting him through his computer because he had an indiscretion on a business trip that she found out about.  Before they could sort  through their issues she had a stroke and died.  

I was 22 and only had about 5 months of work experience at that point, so I just didn't know what to say, so I said I was sorry about his wife and left.  

I went back to our IT area and told my manager and my 2 colleagues what I was told.  They thought I was joking, or that he was playing a joke on me since I was new.  My manager and my colleague who was senior in the group went down later in the day to talk to him and he told them the exact same story.  When they went to collect his PC so they could look at it he refused to let us take it because he thought the PC needed to have some sort of exorcism or intervention.  They really didn't know how to respond.  

That weekend we had to be in the office anyway for a network upgrade so we took a look at his computer and sure enough it was a bad fan.  We replaced it and put it back and decided not to say anything to him and just see what happens.  

A few days later he sees me walking by his lab and calls me in, he then tells me over the weekend he went to see some sort of psychic or something and she helped him talk to his wife so she wouldn't haunt him anymore.  And he knows it worked because his computer no longer turned off on him when he was trying to type up his field visit reports.  

I didn't want to burst his bubble, so I told him I was glad and reported back to my manager.",There's a Ghost in My Computer!,0

$CL: My boss sent me here to get some stuff, and he says I need to pick up a 20 Jigabag UBS dingle . 


Now, I'm used to hearing ""I need a UBS drive/stick, but this was a new one. Never before had I heard someone refer to storage as a Jigabag, and certainly never heard it called a dingle. 

$me: do you mean like a thumb drive to store documents on?

$me: well, they only come in 16, 32 and 64 **GIGABYTES**

$CL: no, you're wrong. My friend got one from here that was 20 Jigabags

$me(internally): oh dear God, it's going to be one of those customers. Please just storm of thinking you're right

$me: well unfortunately they don't make ones like that; however, I can still help you find a relatively cheap drive that's large  enough for you, we actually have some 32 Gb ones on sale right now. 

$CL: THIS IS RIDICULOUS. YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SELL ME SOMETHINF THAT'S MORE THAN I NEED. I have a 20 jigabag file and I need it for a presentation and I need it NOW. If you can't help me I'll just go to $GoodPurchase, at least they know customer service.

The USB is fat32 and her folder full of photos is almost 20Gb. Now normally if I need to reformat a blank drive for someone, I'll do it without charging because it's relatively quick and I can do it on their own device.

"Reading the title, it seems like a reasonable request, right? 

I work at a company that provides and supports field technicians for one of, if not the largest ISP in Belgium. My job is at the Servicedesk, or IT support. I don't assist the client directly, but instead company employees and field techs. It's usually stuff like 'You forgot to activate your VPN' or 'You cant use Chrome for \[platform\], use IE' yada yada. Pretty simple stuff.

Anyway, one of the planners (the people that plan in the techs to specific jobs) came to our 2-man desk and asked 'Can I borrow you guys your expertise?'. Thats... A odd way of putting it. 

Me: A flying fucking meatball  
P: Planner

P: 'So, one of our techs accidently unplugged the power supply to the pc/server of one of the clients, and said client claims that the PC is now completely broken and unusable. What I need to know, is that possible, and is his replacement computer a reasonable one?'  
*P hands me the invoice for the original pc.*  
Me: Hm. Looks like a  Gigabyte Brix (think Intel NUC, tiny little cube that can do office work) with a SSD in it... I dont think it can actually break, atleast not a computer this recent (2015). Data corruption, sure, Windows not working, perhaps. But full-bore hardware failure? I highly doubt it.   
P: See? Thats what I was thinking. But he claims a total hardware defect. Here, this the new PC he bought. Is this a adequate replacement?

Now, the Brix he had was a simple one. Dual Core I3, 250Gb mSATA, 8gb DDR3 (iirc). Not powerfull, but I'm sure it did its work. The invoice was...

Me: The hell? Is he serrious?  
P: Yep, no doubt. Why?  
Me: Intel i5 8600K? GTX 1050Ti? 16Gb DDR4 Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO? 1Tb Samsung 980 SSD? A fucking Sharkoon TG5 RGB case? ROG STRIX Z370-F? This PC is easily worth twice, if not three times the initial one! Hell, this thing is almost the same as my own gaming rig at home, and that thing can run Crysis!(Planner is a gamer, but doesnt know much about hardware, so he gets my joke). No, this is ridiculous.   
P: So.... He's bullshiting us?    
Me:  Let me put it this way. Our tech bumped his 10-year old Lada, he claims it no longer runs, and he bought a brand-new BMW to replace it.    
P: Deny claim?  
Me: Deny claim. I'd be happy to write a 'letter of expertise' if you want

So, the planner is off to tell the client to fuck off. Hopefully, that letter wont be needed, but we'll see if the client wants to combat the denial. Funny thing is, if he just went and bought a new Brix, he would've gotten reimbursed, no question. Its because that the planner noticed that the hardware is different that they took it into doubt.","'Your tech broke my PC, I want to be reimbursed for a new one!""",0
"*Backstory:* I work for a growing company in the mid-west. I was hired a year and half ago for some IT consulting, and have taken on a part time position as the ""IT Manager"" or ""Network Administrator"" ...or doer of all things IT - while I finish my undergrad program at school. I'm not the first person to do IT work for this company, but I am the first on-site staffed IT person to play contribute to daily operations. By and large, I have been received really well by other employees. They might not understand what I do all day long, but they understand why I am there. Because the company I work for is growing pretty quickly (and because this is a new position outright), it has been an on/off struggle to keep everyone's requests satisfied quickly. Three months into the job, I implemented a ticketing system to better organize my work, and separate help requests from other matters. I even put a little icon on everyone's desktop through a GPO so people could just click on it and submit a ticket. When everyone plays by the rules, this system works wonders. 

Remember how I said I've been well received at the company? Well, there are about 2-3 people (out of \~400) that absolutely refuse to acknowledge why I am there and what I do is... well...an actual real job. They all work in a separate department from me and I seldom have to deal with any of them (thankfully). This one particular incident involve one of them (who is a Project Manager for his department), me, and a new computer. 

*$PM= Project Manager - Me=me* 

As many of you are aware, all Win7 computers are loosing their support from Microsoft in January of next year. My boss asked me to get going on that earlier this year and so I have been assessing, updated or replacing all Win7 machines in the company since January of this year. Well, I finally made it down the list to this $PM. I had emailed him a week in advance stating that his machine was due for an upgrade to Windows10 (and why it had to happen), then we had scheduled a date to do. I told him to back up his data to the server, and to make sure nothing mission critical would be on it at this time. In my mind, I thought sweet, maybe he had finally crossed over the dark side was going to let me do my work. 

I get to his desk on the scheduled date and time, and he moves out of the way and lets me upgrade his machine to Windows 10. I even had an extra 4G stick of ram I threw in it to boost its performance. All was going smoothly until he said to me-

*$PM: I really don't know why Im being upgraded. Shouldn't I just get a new machine and we pass this one down?""*

*Me: Well, your machine isn't quite old enough to warrant replacing it just yet. You've got at least another year or two of life in this thing.* 

*$PM: Weeeelllll. Thats some bullsh\*t. I want a new machine!*

*Me: Sorry man, I'm just doing what I'm authorized to do. I can only make approved purchas-*

*$PM: I'm getting a new machine whether your authorized or not!*

Everything that happened prior to this was going so smoothly, I almost shed a tear in joy. But no, it had to derail at the last moment. The next day, I found out he went behind my back to my boss's boss and threw a temper tantrum. My boss came up to me and said to just buy him a new machine and pass his current one down (as if this has happened before in the past). I said Alright and got a new one on the way. It usually takes a couple days for it arrive at the office, and then about half a day to get the machine all set up and configured for who its going to. 

I emailed the $PM again, we set up another time to get it all set up on his desk with a new docking station and everything. Again, I get there at the scheduled time with the new machine and equipment-

*$PM: Uhh yeah. This isn't a good time actually. Just leave the machine here and I'll just wait for you next week.* 

*Me: Okay. (thinking this is going to blow up in my face again).* 

I get home a little early that day only to have 6 emails in my inbox. The first one was ""Hey I switched over my machine to the new one"" proceeded by how do I do, log in to, or what do I do with XYZ for 5 additional emails. So, taking a deep breath, I took a screenshot of all the emails he had sent me, answered all of his questions and then stated that he should use the helpdesk if he has any issues (with a pic of all of the emails he had sent me). Im alerted if there is a ticket so you will be helped either way. *No response.* 

It's now labor day weekend, so naturally I took Monday off and Tuesday marks the first day back to class. (I have my classes scheduled so that they are only on Tuesday and Thursdays, and then I work every Monday Wednesday and Friday.) The week prior I had sent a company wide email reminding people to use the help desk for their issues instead of contacting me directly for support. 

Tuesday morning-  
Text from $PM: *You updated my PDF software and It's not what im used to. Can we roll back to an older version.*

My response: *Most likely, put in a ticket to the helpdesk and we can look at it tomorrow together.* 

Phone call 3 minutes later-

Me: *Hello, this is $Me-*

"*Obligatory ""I'm not in tech support"" comment, because there may be a solution to this I don't know about.*

A few years ago I was involved in running a small conference. The team had selected a keynote speaker, a very distinguished and elderly academic.

He turned up with his presentation on an iPad, which was locked. I asked what the password was and he said ""I don't know, it's my son's iPad"". 

I asked if he had another copy he said ""No. But you shouldn't need to have the password anyway. Surely you just plug it in and it appears? Right?""

And that is how our conference ended up with an elderly academic trying to verbaly describe some slides he wrote a few days earlier to a room full of delegates.

Pro-tip: Always get your speakers to send their slides ahead of the conference.

"This is a quick one, but tl;dr my boss scared the shit out of me.

So the past couple of weeks AD has been slooooooow AF. I tell the Director of IT (aka the only other person in the department/my boss) and he says he'll look in to it. I do some research into the matter myself, but he said he'd handle it so not wanting to undo any changes he does, I leave it be. Fast forward to today, and I'm working in AD for the first time since I told him about the issue, and lo and behold, still slow AF. Okay, fine, just need to create one account and add them to a few groups and sync with Google to make the email. Took about 20 minutes start to finish with me screwing around and getting distracted. I log in to DC01 to see if there are any odd things standing out in task manager, and sign out. It felt a little sluggish, but I didn't notice anything. Then not 30 seconds later, I hear the sound of every fan in a server spin up to max in the datacenter/closet (it's a big closet to be fair), toss the door open, and see all the drives flashing bad colors. Shit, did I break something on accident? Did DC01 die? We did just have to replace a drive due to failure, was it actually the RAID card breaking? Call my boss ""yo, DC01 is having a spasm"" \*laughter from the phone\* ""Well yeah, just rebooted it...""

Son of a bitch... I called for support for a simple restart.

PS - The slowdown issue was caused apparently by an update that it did changing the ipv6 dns to ::1 from automatic apparently. It's running great after he changed that and rebooted it.","Okay, my turn to call ""support"". Jeeze I feel dumb.",0
"I work for a $21B company.  Despite our size, we have a good amount of technical debt.  Unfortunately we also have people like Karen...she was a Director but is now a VP.  Karen has a reputation for being a jerk.

We use Office 365.  For those unaware there is a hard limit to the number of email addresses you can white list. (We don't like to white list an entire domain to prevent spam or phishing in case the sender domains compromised).

We reached the hard limit of 1024 email addresses in the white list.  In speaking with Microsoft, we learned you can have a user white list within Outlook and it doesn't count against the 1024 limit.

OK, so yesterday I get a ticket to the server team to help her because an email she needs was quarantined.  I had previously written documentation for users to release their own messages and to white list the sender to prevent future issues.  I emailed Karen the document and never heard back from her.  Skip to this morning and I see an email from Karen letting me know just how crappy my document was, she said neither she now the local IT people could follow it.  Rather than tell me this and ask for help or provide feedback, she went to my Director and escalated to her telling her I provided poor documentation.

I advised her that I know the instructions are good because I had my team test them out and have had some users test it too.  The only person that had complained started at step 2 instead of step 1.  I offered to walk her through it.  That was when she told me the local IT person released her message for her from quarantine.  But that doesn't white list the address and because we are at the limit if you do try to white list it you get an error.

So step 1 of the document was to login to OWA which sets up the person's credentials to O365.  Step two is to open the quarantine page which will use those same credentials.  Both steps have clearly underlined hyperlinks to follow.

After some digging I found out that she had printed the document and taken it to local IT.  Well naturally they could not follow it because there are no links to click in a printed document.  

I let her know specifically what the techs could not follow the directions, told her I provided them an electronic copy and verified they all understood it.

Shortly after this my Director sent her an email that politely thanked her for bringing this to her attention and that she would make sure the help desk people know what to do going forward.

As an FYI, I would normally Skype or call someone rather than just send an email, but this particular issue had already been documented and was supposed to be resolved on first call from the help desk and should never make it to the server team since it is handled on the client side now.  

Happy to say my Director had my back and I am grateful she had a more eloquent way of sending Karen away.",Escalation without warning.,0
"The following occurred many moons ago when I was a student employee working the Tier 1 Help Desk providing Tech Support to employees and faculty of a university.

&amp;#x200B;

The Cast:

$ME: your fearless narrator, relatively new to the tech-support game

$HC: hopeful co-worker, a bit naive in his observances of the unspoken rules of tech-support, but more advanced in work experience

$NE: father of $HC and Network Architect at the University

$OC: Other co-worker, working the afternoon shift. Also more advanced in the work experience than I.

The Setup:

It was summertime in the Key City and though school was out, the work of learning never stops. $ME and $HC were holding court in the fishbowl answering the occasional phone call. Most of the issues were easily managed with a password reset here or a system reboot there. All in all it was a good day with plenty of time to work on my goal of reading the internet. Mid-day was approaching and the question of food was coming up when the following interaction happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

$HC: I'm going to leave a bit early for lunch so I can meet my dad for lunch. It's slow so you'll be okay.

$ME: (pauses at the dropping of the fateful ""S"" word) Okay. Enjoy your lunch.

$HC leaves the building ~~and is never heard from again~~ 

A few minutes pass and I find that I am unable to read the internet. I reboot my machine and go through some standard troubleshooting procedures to try and address the problem but to no avail. Then my phone rings.

$ME: ""Thank you for calling the HelpDesk, this is $ME, how can I help you today?""

$NE: (skips the pleasantries and cuts straight to the chase) ""Can you get on the internet?""

$ME: No

$NE: ""That's what I thought."" &lt;Click&gt;

$ME: (Thinking to myself) That was ominous

By this time $OC had arrived and since the entire campus was on their lunch hour ~~and a half~~ the phones had not started ringing yet. At this point, I held out hope that the issue would be resolved before the end of lunch. I was to be disappointed in that hope. Word came down from Networking that there was an issue with our campus-wide connection to the internet through our ISP, a major multi-national company. Basically, our connection was broken and no traffic was going through. 

I repeated the following conversation dozens of times in the x hours it took to fix the issue.

""Thank you for calling the HelpDesk, this is $me, how can I help you?"" 

\--some version of-- ""I can't get on the internet!!!""

""We are currently experiencing problems with our network and are working to resolve them asap. No, I do not have an ETA yet on when the issue will be resolved.""

&amp;#x200B;

And that kids, is why we never, EVER!, make comment on how SLOW it is, or why the phones are so QUIET. To do so, is to invite the ire of the call-center spirits to rectify that situation in the most severe manner possible.

"Disclaimer: ""Susan"" is not the name of a single individual. It is a pseudonym I use to represent all the users at my workplace whom give me problematic, humorous, or otherwise memorable interactions.

Susan: ""Hello IT? My screen is upside down.""

This happens sometimes. People will try to hit CTRL+ALT+DEL and instead hit one of the arrow keys instead of DEL. This causes the screen to shift. Just have to hit CTRL+ALT+Up Arrow to put it back. It is a little odd because sometimes it will work on the lock screen and other times it will not. If they are at the lock screen I just go ahead and have them sign in before we correct it.

"So this happened recently.

I work at a national MSP in Pro Services, so 90% of my work is project-related. I work closely with a network engineer, whereas I'm the server/virtualization guy. 

We got wind from the NOC of a repeat client of ours with three branches, and whose mid-size branch seemingly lost external internet connectivity  overnight. My partner and I cannot help ourselves and began looking into it.

It took a little while, but eventually we noticed that the branch ASA's default gateway was an appliance we do not manage. I contact the client and tell them they need to get that other vendor involved ASAP to check that hardware.

I'm cc'd on the outgoing message, in which the client asks: ""Could this be due to blocking port 53?""

WHAT.

An email conversation ensued, and the vendor reverses the block. Boom, internet. 

The vendor replies with, ""We apologize; our engineers told us this would not be service-impacting.""

HEAD DESK.

Apparently, because they were using Google DNS forwarders, that was flagged by an auditor, and not knowing exactly what to do, they asked the vendor to just block all port 53. What's even more amazing is the vendor did it without question.",The oblivious client and vendor,0
"This happened a few years ago, I worked for a company that had a business that was selling and reselling electronic equipment.

We took our business online and had a very simple setup. We had a large server with the main website running.

We would sell equipment and get calls from customers asking if their equipment was there. When we told them we would need to be connected via USB for them to be able to see what they were getting, they had none.

One day we went out to a customer and explained that everything was connected via USB.

We received a call after the sale and asked if the equipment was plugged in. ""Yes, but I've never plugged it in""

""Well, I can't just plug it in, I've checked it and everything looks good."" ""Okay, give it a minute and I'll be back.""

We took a phone call back and she plugs in the USB. The phone rang after the initial bootup and we took a look inside. The USB and power cable are plugged into the motherboard, not the power supply. She plugs it in and it boots up fine.

""And that's when I noticed something weird"". The motherboard is not plugged into the power supply.

""Okay, I'll be right back.""

After a few minutes, we get a call.

""Oh no, we could not see anything.""

""Okay, I'll be right back.""

""Well, you don't plug it in.""

""I'll be right back."" (In front of hundreds of people) ""Okay, I'll be right back."" ""Thank you, I'm off.""

"Happened today. I am still in disbelief. 
There might be typos, I'm still calming down.

Backstory: I am one of only two IT personnel at a dozen+ building facility with over 1,000 endpoints. Naturally, they smash every IT position into one role. 

We issue multi-factor authentication devices to management and some senior staff so they can do their work offsite. Once the handoff of the device is complete, our responsibility ends, and user has a packet with all the data to get them up and going. A separate, remote team for MFA exists exclusively for support of these devices. This has been protocol for years.

Clock in and find nasty email from Director #1 ($D1) sitting in my inbox this morning about how ""unacceptable"" and ""unbelievable"" that one of their staff could not log in from home this weekend due to $user's MFA device not ""functioning correctly for months"" (first we've heard of the issue).

Director has been in their position 10+ years.

My response (cc'd to all directors): ""All support for these devices is handled by the MFA team as stated when the devices are issued. We have neither the tools nor ability to help in this matter. In the future, please have the user contact MFA team at ### as explicitly stated in the documentation.""

30 minutes later, I am called into $D1's office. $D1 and two other directors ($D2, $D3) start arguing with me why I didn't solve the issue.

Me: ""All support for these devices is handled by the external MFA team. $user can call the number provided for support. As I said, we do not have the tools to do this.""

$D2: *voice raising* ""why won't you help $user? aren't you IT? Can't you solve simple problems?""

Me: ""... All. Support. For. These. Devices. Is. Handled. By. The --""

$D3: *screaming* ""WOULD YOU JUST DO YOUR JOB??""

$D1: ""That's exactly my point! $pukeforest isn't helping $user with this! I'm going to issue a Corrective Action Plan and I WILL report this incident to HR.""

Me: *staring* ""what.. what is it exactly you need me to do?!""

Picture three directors, cursing and pointing at me for nearly 10 minutes. I'm talking walls are vibrating with their screams. Other directors in the hall close their doors as I am getting verbally clobbered. I stare through the wall. My anxiety is through the roof.

Insult after insult about work performance, how this is typical of how shoddy we are as IT professionals.

Finally, $user in question comes to the door.

$D1: ""DO YOUR DAMN JOB and get $user set up!""

I'm visibly shaking at this point. Stunned.

Breathing heavily, I manage to walk over to $D1's desk phone. On speakerphone, I proceed to dial the off-site MFA team's number. 

A voice comes on the line.

""$MFAguy, can I help you?""
I motion to $user to introduce themselves and speak their issue.

About 90 seconds later, $user can log in. Tested. Works perfectly.
Everyone is silent and staring at me.

I shake my head disgustedly and leave.

$D1, $D2, and $D3 have avoided eye contact with me all day.

"Sometimes, being a small cog in a large machine can be frustrating. Large company, lots of contractors, lots of outsourcing.

I work in our service desk. When something goes wrong, they call us. I sometimes dream of the Active Directory environment being directly managed by us, but that's not the case. Onboarding and offboarding is similarly out of our hands, it should all just work automatically.

A few days ago, we get a weird issue where old users that should be properly offboarded have not been. They're still ghosting around in our systems. We have a list of users that are affected, and now we want to find out if they're disabled or not, and what their account expiry date was. Simple, right? Whipped up a quick script to export that data from AD, run it, kick back and relax-..

It doesn't run. Server doesn't have the right settings. Easy, I just have to contact the people in charge of our server!

They can't change the setting.

Can't or won't? Who knows?! No one. No one knows. Okay fine, we'll just ask our vendor who provides our AD services to do the export. We'll even provide the script! Easy!

No results. They can't or won't help. We need this data, yet our vendor is so awful they won't help.

That's the story of how I ended up searching for 125 users, one by one, in two different AD environments, to manually write down their expiry dates and their enabled/disabled status.

"This might not be allowed because it's not about helping someone specifically. But it did happen *while* working tech support. I had the dream thing for any tech support worker, or call center worker in general, happen to me yesterday.

In a previous post I mentioned that we are currently overstaffed at my call center. This results in long waits between calls. About half an hour before closing I was second in line for the next call. I figured that this would work nicely. I expected to get a call after about 10 minutes. Then spend about ten minutes in the call and then just wait out the last 10 minutes.

Then the clock just kept ticking without a single phone call. Eventually the guy who was in front of me got a call. But at that point it was less than 15 minutes left. There was still a chance I could get a call that I could solve without me working overtime. But with every passing minute it got riskier. We got to 10 minutes left. Then 5 minutes left. Still no phone call. I was getting nervous. 

Then it happened. The queue crashed. Causing all agents to be kicked off the queue. By the time I had logged back in to the system I was so far back there was no way I would get a call in the remaining 3 minutes.

Me: Thank you for calling \*ISP\*, this is \*dumdum\*, how can I help you

FL: Hi, I have been trying to connect to the internet and I cant get on.  Is there some problem you guys are having?

Me:  Sorry to hear that Ma'am, I'll help you out the best that I can.  If you can please hold on while i check the system?

After reviewing the system screens, I see that there are no issues with the servers or the modem bank.  Ask CW to check and confirms there is no issues on our side.

Me: Sorry for the wait Ma'am, I just checked the systems and had the administrator check as well and we don't see any issues.  Can i please have your account number and I'll check on your account status.

FL: Its 55555555.  Can you please hurry this up?  I need to check my emails.....

Me: Sure thing Ma'am, Ok I see that you have a Dial-up connection at 56K speeds, and.......

At this point I hear a clicking sound, like someone is picking up and hanging up a phone on the line.  

Me: Ma'am is there someone at your home trying to use the phone?  

FL: No I live alone.

Clicking continues.

Me: Ok Ma'am, we are going to do some quick troubleshooting steps so I can get an idea of what could be causing the issue.

FL: No I only have one....why does it matter?????

Me: Ma'am dial-up service works through your phone line, you can only use one function at a time.  If you are on your phone then you cant use the internet, vise-versa you cant use the phone while on the internet.  Could you please do me a favor and hang up and try again.  

FL: NO!  YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO GET ME OFF THE PHONE SO YOU DONT HAVE TO FIX IT!!!!

Me: No Ma'am, I'll be here for the next few hours and will be taking calls.  I need you to do this so i can test your connection.  I assure you I'll answer if you try again and cant get on.

FL: YOU BETTER!!!

"So I work in a school that uses a shit database running in filemaker. It's a a slow sluggish piece of garbage that doesn't run well on anything. Filemaker is from Apple, so no surprise there. The server (it's a 2012 R2 VM) that it's running on sole purpose in life is running filemaker and it's database. The people that use it during the summer got used to it not being THAT bad. But this being the beginning of school, every teacher is still staying on top of their attendance during advisory hours. This means that not everyone can actually sign in at once, and 20+ people attempting to sign in boots people off. I get it, it's frustrating. But this happens every year at this time.

"So this is a story I've been hanging onto for a while and revolves around a previous place of employment. Sooo, here goes.

**Backstory:** So I worked at a place that once a year there was an inspection by multiple state and local agencies due to HIPPA and all that good jazz. Each year these agencies would send someone out to inspect different aspects of the operation. One of which was protection of HIPPA data stored on-prem. The head of the place would have the Director of IT show the people around and talk about what we were doing. Of course this particular Director of IT knew just enough jargon to pretend to be knowledgeable.

**Cast: $Me = Me, $ITDir = IT Director, $SA = State Auditor**

This one particular day our $ITDir shows up and lets us know in about a hour we will have visitor to check out our security we are using to secure the data and our network. Auditor shows up and it goes a little like this.

&gt;$SA - So, tell me about what you are using to secure the data on the network  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - We have a firewall  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$SA - A firewall? Anything else you are doing to secure the data? Encryption on the server, Bitlocker on end devices, access logging?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - Yes, we have a firewall and it encrypts data and Endpoint  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$SA - But that's only from the inbound/outbound data if you're using a VPN. What about internally?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - Umm, I think so on the server but I would have to ask our network guy. Hey,   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me do we use encryption on the servers or endpoints  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me - No..$SA - You should be encrypting your data on the network and end devices to protect the client data.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - Hey $Me why aren't we using it.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me - Well because since I've been here in the last several years and asked to implement it I've been told by you and the DBA we don't need it.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - $SA we are going to look into this and see what needs to be done. But in the meantime we have a firewall to secure our network.

Long story short the auditor tried his best as we in IT had for some time to convince the IT Director of the need to secure the network. Ended up he placed us under a warning to have it fixed before the next audit date.

Well in the next six months before I ended up moving on the network was hit multiple times by security issues.

"Let me take you back in time, to the ancient world of 2014, where Skandranonsg learns of the folly of a life of crime. The first act of this story will be told from the perspective of our local ne'er-do-wells.

----------

""Alright, ready?""

The quiet din of the industrial park is punctured by the sound of shattering glass, followed by the angry wailing of the security system, a cacophonous clock reminding the two men crawling through the barred door that their time in this place would be short.

""That one."" An arm extends towards a large TV sitting on a shelf, while the other reaches for a slim computer tower closer to the entrance. Their first haul stowed away in the back of their aging red pickup, they return for another. Not spotting anything else obviously valuable, a desk is overturned, drawers emptied, but nothing else makes it out the door except for a half-disassembled laptop from the tech's bench.

As briefly as it took you to read this section, the thieves were gone, adrenaline coursing at their act of larceny committed that night.

----------

Fortunately for the small time distributor I was working for at the time, we couldn't have asked for less intelligent thieves. It was determined immediately that this was not even remotely planned, nor was it an inside job, as the items stolen were not exactly the ideal targets.

The TV was a display model for digital signage with a proprietary controller. Without that company's software (that you get for free when you purchase a TV) and the controller, the thing is practically worthless. The desktop that was taken was just a case with a power supply and motherboard, and the laptop was pretty much a write-off already.

They just so happened to walk by 3 boxes, each containing between forty and sixty 8 GB sticks of RAM, a box with ~50 Windows 7 and 8 Pro/Business licenses. Each of those boxes weighed significantly less than what the thieves stole, but was worth orders of magnitude more.

----------

Today's lesson? Crime doesn't pay, but at least know what's worth stealing before you steal it.",A Crime of Opportunity,0
"We have a great many application servers. Most of which have been migrated to the VMWare environment, but there are still a few running on physical hosts. These systems are, for the most part, ancient and running on RHAS 4 because the app team doesn't feel like migrating those instances over.  


Since I've worked in this division, we have NEVER patched our production systems. Upon learning this, I began screaming about it to management. Of course, app support and the client engagement managers don't want to TOUCH anything in production; this division has a cowboy history and they used to make unsanctioned changes in the middle of the day and bring clients down. The blowback was, ""Don't touch production. AT ALL!"" Hence, no OS patches.  


All of this has changed since InfoSec started scanning our systems and finding security vulnerabilities caused by a lack of patching. Suddenly, management wants us to patch this crap. Except for the RedHat 4 servers, which already are at the latest patch level since, well, it's OLD.

&amp;#x200B;

So we do a patch prep. Non-prod was patched last year. Nobody wanted to touch prod at the time. We applied more non-prod patches a few months ago, and now it's time to patch prod. I tell the PM to NOT patch the physical app servers because they're running RedHat 4. Offshore is handling the patching.  


Saturday night, I get a panicked call from the Project Manager. Offshore rebooted a physical server as a pre-patch sanity check, and it *didn't come back up*. They can't access the iLO. Well, this is great. My data center admin is on vacation and won't be back until next week, and this is likely going to require a trained tech attaching a console to the server and fixing it. The only trained tech who can do this is yours truly, and I'm in another state. We get the app team on the line and ask them if they could, pretty please, deploy the application instances that this server hosts onto the VMs that I made available for just this purpose SIX FUCKING MONTHS AGO? We're essentially at half capacity and when people start using the system Monday morning that half is NOT going to cut it.  


App team says that it's a significant effort to migrate the application to the VMs. It took them a month to get DR migrated. (Funny, that, you lazy jackasses have had SIX to do prod!). My boss asks if there's ANY alternative. Well, I can open a work order to have a data center technician disconnect and reconnect the power to the server and hope that it fixes the iLO. This is a Gen 6 HP, which means ilo100 or iLO2. We've got another Gen6 that has a profoundly broken ilo100, so I'm not optimistic. Boss says to open an expedited request. $$$$  


Well, after the power cycle, I'm able to access the iLO and get in to the console. The server boots up fine, but the network is...well...*NYET*working. I dig in, and discover that bond0 has NO active aggregators. A check of all 8 physical interfaces shows that only ONE of them is active, and when I look at the interface configuration, I see that it's master is bond0...but it's NOT A SLAVE. This file was last touched in 2014. I fix the configuration and restart the network, and it comes up. I make a mental note to talk to my boss Monday morning about the lack of network redundancy on this *mission critical* app server.  


Of course, I'm pissed at offshore. They rebooted a server without first verifying console access. I assumed that this physical server was running RHAS 4...it's not. It's running RHEL 6 like the VMs are. That explains the patching, but had I examined it closer, I would have told them to defer this server until the data center admin was back, and we would perform a firmware update prior to applying OS patches.   


  
So, last night, I get a panicked call from the Incident Management team. It seems that our source code repository is down. As I'm getting ready to call in to the bridge and yell at someone for waking me up for a NON-PRODUCTION OUTAGE, my offshore guy calls me. To tell me that the code repository server is down. And of yeah, so is the *mission critical* application server from the previous night.  


I tell him to forget the damned code server, THIS outage is the priority. I login to the iLO and bring up the console and the server is up. Except, there's a syslog message on the terminal that the ethernet link has gone down.  


The **sole** network interface is no longer connected to the network. Now, I'm well aware of the default response when there's a server issue to blame the network, but in this case, ethtool reports that the interface has NO LINK. That's a goddamned network problem. I tell offshore that the server is fine, but he needs to call the network team and get them to fix the network. I stress this again: the server is FINE. The NETWORK is broken. Fix the ***NETWORK***.

&amp;#x200B;

I go back to bed, and an hour later, incident management calls again. They need the data center phone number because there appears to be a power issue. I give them the number and try to go back to sleep. They can sort out if the data center is having an issue, or if we've lost a power strip.  


An hour later, my phone rings AGAIN. It's my data center admin. He's back from Burning Man, but he's sick as a dog. The data center called him because the incident manager tried to use MY credentials to get information, and they'll be sending me a password reset link. She she works for the company and NOT our division, she has NO access to the data center. Incident management calls me as I'm telling my admin to take some NyQuil and get some sleep.  


A month ago, I had received a notification that the data center was replacing an end-of-life piece of power equipment that would take down circuit A. All of the important stuff has 2 power supplies, plugged in to power strips on circuits A and B. I had completely forgotten about this because I got the notice a month ago, and, well, we've got redundancy. Plus, I'm half asleep. The network admin tells me that they lost a FEX. He gets the data center tech to check and it's got both power supplies plugged in to the same power strip. At this point, it clicks. The last time I was at the data center, my admin was telling me that we've got several power strips that are failing, and when he asks for maintenance windows to replace them, he gets told, ""DON'T TOUCH THAT! IT'S CRITICAL PRODUCTION!"" We had lost a power strip a while back, and he had to relocate device power to keep the other one from becoming overloaded. This FEX was one of those devices.  


But it's back up now. The code repository is available and still running. But that app server? Nobody can access it. Offshore says, ""Oh, I reset the server to try and fix it.""  


*YOU DID WHAT?*  


I remember, VERY CLEARLY, telling him, ""**There's nothing wrong with the server. Fix the network.**""  
Bruh. No matter HOW MANY TIMES you reboot a server, it's NOT going to fix the dead switch that it's plugged in to.  


I check the iLO and the fucking thing is POWERED OFF. I boot the server and verify that the network is functional, and tell the app support team to bring up the application. Which takes 45-60 minutes.   


Today, I'm in meeting to discuss mitigating single points of failure. The data center is doing maintenance on circuit B tonight, so we'll see if we have any devices plugged in to ONLY that circuit. The app team is getting yelled at for not migrating their app to VMWare. I made SURE that the onshore Major Incident Manager got that in her ticket: This app needs to be migrated off of the physical server ASAP.  


tl;dr - Offshore tech takes down a critical application server TWICE in as many days, ruining my weekend sleep.","The Saga Of The Critical Server, OR, ""Quit Rebooting That Thing!""",0
"Hello TFTS, this happened to me a few months back.

I am a supervisor at my company, and one day things were running as normal when it was discovered the audio in our briefing room wasn't working. Its a simple setup, some external speakers, a large television, hooked up to a PC. Our tech was losing his mind trying to figure out why there was no sound playing whilst he was trying to give a presentation. He radios me, and I come have a look.

&amp;#x200B;

Tech: Scheisse\_poster, I think we're going to have to escalate this. I've tried reinstalling the drivers, restarting the machine, and even sacrificed a goat to the machine, and I still can't get any sound. I unhooked the speakers, tested them on another machine, they worked fine. 

Me: I'll have a look, make sure your radio is on.

So I take a look, and sure enough... Off to the side... In the right hand corner. The sound was muted. I turned the sound back on, and radioed my tech back.

Me: So, to be clear, if you're stumped and I solved it in three seconds, you owe me lunch right?

Tech: You're kidding?

Me: Check you phone.

&amp;#x200B;

I had sent him a picture I had taken of the speaker icon in the corner, indicating it was muted. Had a good laugh, bring it up now and again for a laugh at his expense.",Never forget the basics,0
"I work on a help desk that supports several large companies both in call centers and engineering. The team of 10 I'm part of supports one of those large companies as their level 1-4 help desk. Earlier today a user called my colleague to report her laptop missing from her office. Before she could even finish writing the ticket, the user called me, nearly freaking out and asking if I could make the ticket a P1. I said I could raise the urgency from 3 to 1 and did so, then hung up. 5 minutes passed and she called another colleague. She's lost it. Again she's asking why the issue isn't a P1, he starts to explain to her that a P1 is reserved for issues where the company is pretty much burning and mass amounts of users are unable to work. Before he can finish, she screams at him ""Well it's a p1 to me!"" He finishes explaining that we've elevated it far as we can and she can go talk to local if she wants. 20 minutes pass after the call and the ticket gets updated by local, the laptop was her loaner that local had picked back up.

I hope you enjoyed reading.","Well, it's a P1 to me!",0
"I just saw a post making mention of a similar situation which reminded me of this, and thought you guys might get a giggle/facepalm out of it.

I do device repairs &amp; technical support for quite a few families and businesses locally, and a couple of years back received an emergency call. The owner of one of the businesses I support had purchased a new phone and needed to know how to transfer important data to it from her old phone. I order a taxi, grab my laptop and head out. It turned out the ""important data"" was her Candy Crush progress, but she didn't let me know this until I arrived.

I tried to make light of it - I wasn't particularly amused at having my evening interrupted for this - and deadly serious, she snapped back that it was important because she was trying to give up smoking and she needed it to relax during work breaks.

I looked up how to do it (via Facebook account, it turns out; she had never logged in on the old phone), transferred the data over and charged her double time for the post-5pm call out.",Emergency Callout: Customer crushed without important data!,0

"Super quick one.

Customer A (a company director) emails me to get email password for customer B (employee) changed. Doesn't specify the password so gets a randomly-generated one, and gets replied back with it. 

A couple hours/days (don't remember) go by and customer B calls in that they can't get into their email. I use the new password, just to see if it wasn't reset again, or if I didn't use the wrong password after all. I log in no problem, but there is a new email called ""New password"" from A, and the contents are pretty much:

*Hi B, we had your email password reset, here's the new one: ########*

-_-

I explain we were asked to change the password, then provided it to B. Didn't say anything else and let them to form their own opinion on the matter.

**Edit:**

 so after reading some comments, it appears the impression is that this is about security, this is not the case. The people I work with are sometimes even incapable of writing the password the correct way, let alone remembering it, and sometimes they don't even have a personal address. And yes, I do have root access, which has the capability to access any mailbox without the password for it.

The point was that the Customer A sent the new password of the email account, to that same email account that had the password changed, expecting the B to be able to read the the email, because Catch-22.

"I was once on a ticket for ""Flash problems"" and I was told that someone was having trouble with their browser was not able to get them to do the site. I asked them over the phone which browser they were using and if they had tried another browser. They told me that they were using Chrome and that they were told that it works best for this site(This was before Google brought extra buttons to push for Flash to work). I was confused by why she insisted on using Flash, and not Internet Explorer. I eventually went to her desk and asked if she could show me the site that she was going to and why Chrome was such an important part to use on this site. She showed me Chrome, which was obviously in Incognito Mode, though she didn't mention it. I asked her what site she was having the problem with. She showed me Facebook, which wasn't uncommon for her department because she planned events from time to time. When I asked what part of Facebook was causing her problems, she immediately flipped to the Candy Crush game and said that the Flash game was giving her trouble and she was asking for help with the level that she was on. I told her that it wasn't a flash problem, and that she could have waited for after work to play the game. Turns out that she was told that she was told by a co-worker that she could only play it in Incognito mode at work because she ""was being tracked by IT"" I told her that we don't regularly do that without cause and that playing games might be a cause for some people. She heard me and still asked me for tips on how to beat the level. Honestly, I had no idea, because she was on a way higher level than me",Flash problems,0
"Much to the chagrin of the creature known as the ""Accountant"", time marches on. As is the case in the following case.

Let us skip the menial diagnostics and go to the good stuff, shall we?

Customer: I can't send in my form!

Me: Could you check the program version? It is in the bottom left corner. 

Customer: \*reads out version that is over a year old\*

Me: You will need to update the program, as you are running a very outdated version, which will not be able to send your forms, and even if you manage to do it, it will get rejected due to being out of date. You can do it in the updates tab.

Customer: Okay, I will try. It is not working.

Me: \*after much diagnosing I feel dread dawn upon me...\* .... Say, in the very bottom left of your screen, do you see the start menu button?

Customer: Yes.

Me: ....What does it look like?

Customer: It says Start, obviously.

\*initialize facepalm.exe\*

Me: You are running Windows XP... Please consider upgrading to at least Windows 7 in order to be able to use services, as XP is no longer supported by anyone, including the developer.

Customer: But It works just fine! Are YOU gonna pay for my new computer?!

Me: \*it dawns on me that the PC is also comparable in technology\* ...Unfortunately literally no one supports XP anymore. I cannot say anything other than you will need to upgrade.

Customer:  You can't force me to buy a new system!

Me: Indeed, that is why it is platform independent. You may run it on anything that the latest JAVA runs on, including free systems.

"So, you want to hear a tale from tech? Sure thing. Sit down, grab your C64 Bodypillow and be amazed or frightened or whatever..

***The Tale of the Cleartext Externals***

Some may know that I am now working a day (or Night-)job to earn my cookies. Some may have caught that I'm helping the owner of that place of work in IT. She's been paying some dude *60€/Month* since sept 2016 to make a website. Thats about... yeah... three years. The website never existed, and according to the logs, never even has been worked on. So, being the IT Prodigy she reveres me for, I offer to step up and get it done (for a nice one time fee), since the competition is doing mad online stuff like inviting the youth to a BBQ and getting massive karma points.

The host for both domain and webspace is a local company. Hard red flag, as their own website **404**s out on their products and descriptions, uses basic html with lots of .html files in &lt;iframe&gt; tags. It took me three weeks to get access data. But wait, there is more...

See, in the modern age, password protection of online related stuff is quite, let's say, important, with the GDPR and DSGVO and other multi-letter acronyms. So, first step is to take the user name, and request a password reset. The simplest thing for some company who charges about six hundred euros per year for ""web hosting"", right?

We keep waiting. Four hours later, the reset mail does not arrive, on neither of the adresses listed. Instead, now the password reset form **404**s as well. By now its a saturday evening and they will most likely have gone home. I still have a full night shift ahead of me.

Come past Monday I call. Note: They do not know me. I simply stated that I work for my Boss and need access data. Without verification, they tell me the username(s). But not the password. This is bad. No backcheck with the boss, no security question, over the central phone line. Queue the Gnome waving a huge red flag in the background.

Frustrated I instruct $Boss, who isn't very tech savy, what to demand from them and what I need to get it running before making the website happen. By now I have created a complete portfolio of the companies services, values, and contact info on my own webspace, I'd just need to mirror it over.

Wait until past wednesday. I get two emails from $boss. My eyes start sweating profusely because they sent over the password. In clear text. No ""Claim Password"" link. No Security verification again. The only way this Password was ""encrypted"" (as they stated in the mail), was...

It was written with ~~strikethrough~~. Because **THAT** will make it unreadable.

I login. It's not an account with any access to any features. I can simply read the logs, and see they didn't touch the account since october 2016.

Slightly horrified, I call. This time with $boss' Authorization so they know I'm allowed to take this project over. And here is, where the Nightmare actually began.

$phone: ""*Hello, this is WebhostingCompany XY, I'm the Intern $bla, how can I help you?*""

$me: ""*Hey, this is Dex speaking on behalf of $bosscompany. You just sent over a password in cleartext, but the account has no access to the Web hosting features like FTP and SQL, the two things you've been instructed to.*""

$bla: ""*Thats odd. Can you give me the username and password so I can check it out for myself?*""

I am slightly taken aback by this request. 

$me: ""*Your company just sent it over, and in line with data protection laws I am not allowed to say this password just out loud in the open space over a phone. Please either note a callback from someone in the Hosting department or a supervisor. I am sorry that it hits you but this is really not acceptable.*""

$bla: ""*I understand, Can I take notes of what is needed?*""

(Side note: Be nice to people at the phone. I've worked that job myself and you're 100% more likely to get help if you are not a douchecanoe)

$me: ""*Sure. I need FTP and SQL access and working login data for both, and this is not given in the account your company sent me, which my boss is paying an exorbitant amount for each year.

"Today a short tale that reminds us never to underestimate the nonchalance with which clients give you wrong and imprecise information about their problem:

Situation: Customer is a small company that operates an office and a workshop location. Employees from the workshop location sometimes RDP into a machine in the office because this is the only way they can operate some bad 30 year old software they use. In order to start the RDP connection they simply click the RDP icon on the desktop and enter their credentials.

Client: ""Hey, the remote connection doesn't work!""

Me: ""Ok, what exactly doesn't work? Is there an error message?""

Client: ""Well there used to be an error message. I don't remember what it said. Now it just doesn't work.""

Me: ""So what happens when you try to establish the connection? Just nothing?""

Client: ""The icon is gone. I can't do anything.""

Me: ""Ok, let me do a remote support session on your machine then.""

\*\* client starts our remote support software and let's me connect \*\*

Me: ""Indeed, the icon is gone. It also isn't in the recycling bin. Let me check the RDP connection software.""

\*\* I look at the software and it's completely empty. Like that client-machine never had established an RDP connection to a server-machine... \*\*

Me: ""Well that's strange... it looks like every trace of the RDP connection has disappeared. And you tell me it just did this by itself?""

Client: ""Yes, as I said... there once was some error message and then the icon just disappeared!""

Me: ""Ok, let me just get the connection information and credentials so that I can setup the connection again.""

\*\* While getting the credentials  for the RDP connection it started to dawn on me...  \*\*

Me: ""Hey, just another question... the Desktop I'm connected to right now... is this the Desktop of the PC in your workshop or did you already establish the remote connection to the office and then connect me into that?""

Client: ""Ah, yes, I already connected to the office. I thought that makes it easier for you.""

Me: ""... well ... but you said your problem was that you can't establish the remote connection... so this obviously can't be the case if we in fact right now are connected...""

Client: ""Now look, it doesn't work! I can't start BADSOFTWARETHEYUSE! The icon is missing.""

Me: ""Oh, well, that's quite a different issue then...""

\*\* I go to the location of the EXE of the bad software, make a new desktop shortcut to replace the one that he obviously deleted and he was happy again...  a case that could have been solved in about 15 seconds if the guy cared to give a halfway correct description of his actual problem ... \*\*",Remote connection doesn't work!,0
"I got a call from a wedding and corporate event venue I do tech support for. They said on the phone ""The lower speaker is working for the music, but the upper speakers aren't. How can we get the upper speakers to play the music?""

I called them on FaceTime to diagnose. The ""lower"" speaker they were talking about was the subwoofer found in the cabinet with the AV equipment. The upper speakers weren't producing sound even though they could hear the rumble from the sub.

I had the staff check the connections to the sub. All fine. Then I had them point the camera at the AV receiver. The volume was set to 19. It defaults to 60 when you turn it on, so someone must have turned it down. I told the staff ""Turn the receiver volume up to 60.""

Staff: ""Won't that be super loud?""

Me: ""It'll be fine.""

Staff, talking to the client whose phone had the music on it they wanted to play: ""Ok can you get music playing? We're going to turn the volume up to 60. But turn your phone down to half volume so it's not super loud if it works.""

Me: \*headdesk\*

Staff: ""It's still not working. We can hear the lower speaker but nothing is coming from the upper speakers.""

Me: ""Turn the phone volume up to 100%.""

Staff: ""Won't that be super loud?""

Me: ""It won't. Just turn it up slowly.""

Staff: ""I'm worried that's going to be super loud.""

Me: ""*Please* turn the phone volume up to 100%. Trust me.""

Staff: ""Oh! We fixed it. Kthxbye."" And they hung up.

"About 20.000 dollars.

This story takes place over a few years.

cast: BossA1 and A2, and BossB, BuildingA and B, CompanyA and B. And me from companyA.

Many years ago it was decided to sort out a mess with staff, owners and buildings.

You see the staff in buildingB was working for companyA while BossB was working for companyB in buildingB. We were going to  sort a to a and b to b.

Because of legal things BossB could not go back to the old analog way of archiving mail and letters, after companyA had gone digital. It was too expensive and completely unrealistic that companyB could house their own servers in buildingB.

So it was to be that companyB was going to pay companyA for use of dark fiber. BuildingB had dark fiber from A, it was up to me to set the price of it, included was a bit extra for those one minute jobs that is not really worth sending an extra bill for. I gave the numbers to BossA1 and forgot about/ignored it. 

BossA1 went into retirement with A2 replacing him. Company A and B where still not completely separated at this point and there was minimal tech support needed a few AP that needed resetting, a printer in a GPO. This was covered in the small extra money they paid for internet.

Then they wanted some new laptops, finally something big enough to care sending a bill. I set them up and went to BossA2 and asked to add four laptops pluss time to set them up to the usual bill we were sending them.

BossA2 could not find a trace of anything about internet or an agreement with companyB.

And that is how someone paid 200.000 NOK for a couple of laptops (and use of our fiber for a few years)",How someone paid over 200.000 NOK for four laptops.,0

"Yesterday I had an interesting interaction I have yet to experience. Keep in mind we use Azure sync to keep Local AD and 365 more centralized in management.

UserB sent me an email the UserA could not log in and needed thier password reset. So I reset it and go about my day.

2 hours later I get a call from UserA saying they can't log in anymore and they need my help ASAP. Due to me being somewhat fresh in the company I try to be very on top of things and go to people office to meet them and figure out thier issue in real time. 

When I get there I want to actually facepalm. The user was already logged into the domain and had been all logged in all day. So I ask him to show me the issue...... He typed his username in wrong to Outlook and could not log in. So I point out the proper structure of our emails. So he corrects the issue and try to log in again... His password won't work..... Of course he forgot he had asked UserB to ask for a password reset which happens at the AD lvl and syncs with 365. He never reset his password. So I had him log out and log in with his reset password which then promptly asked him to create a new password which of course he struggles with because he tries to make his new password his original password. I inform his about password rules and he corrects his error. Logs into the domain and then his email.

All that hassle just because the user didn't read his credentials and just thought it was right before asking for a reset...

I asked, not realising that I was about to test my tech knowledge to the limit!

My eyes found their target, sending commands to my finger to reach out and stab once at the keyboard in front of me. Years of experience guiding my digit as it descending to one key in particular.

So while sitting at a users desk, like clockwork, one of their co-workers will pass by and say: ""Wait, you're not Linda!"" or various versions of: ""Wow Linda you've certainly changed your look today, haha!""

"As mentioned before, tech support for the Fruit-based enterprise. Here's one from this week.

This customer calls in with a 2015 desktop computer, which at the time would've cost around $1500 new. I also notice he is a loyal customer. He's pretty much got at least one of each device (iPhones, iPads, Watches, TV).

C: Customer

M: Me

After introducing myself and asking what's up, he says this:

C - ""I've bought this computer around 2.5 years ago but Sunday was the first time I opened it and turned it on. I hear it chime and the keyboard plays sounds, but I can't see anything.""

&amp;#x200B;

After a brief pause for disbelief, I checked and the computer had actually been bought over 3 years ago and didn't have any indication that it had been used before.

After doing the usual spiel of key combinations, resets and pointing a flashlight on the screen (an image can be visible like this if the backlight is busted), we quickly determine this is a hardware failure and a repair is needed. The issue of course, is that he is out of warranty and needs to pay up.

&amp;#x200B;

C - ""But this computer is new, it's the first time I'm using it! Surely something was wrong from the factory!""

Me - ""Right, but warranties count from the day you buy it, not the day you first use it. And there's no way to tell it was not working from the day you got it, you never used it, right?""

C - ""No, it's been sat in my office since I got it. You can see I'm a loyal customer, surely there has to be some consideration for this! You just can't outright say I need to go and pay.""

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing that this is a lost cause, I made up some bullshit about inactive electronic components and how they can seize up if they are inactive for a long time, like a car, but he can just have the computer seen and then see what he wants to do.

We agree to this and he's supposed to email me when he goes to get a report. As we say goodbyes, I tried to save face and asked him for feedback.

""You were fine and I liked the way you took my call, that's why I want you to continue this case with me.""

"This story literally happened yesterday. So being the sole IT admin of a company based in Miami that produces juices for supermarkets, I was very stressed over what kind of damage Dorian could cause us. I triple checked everything and prepped the entire company. Shutdown procedures, verified backups both local and offsite, tarps, garbage bags, disconnected anything that didn't need to be connected, etc. I did not want to deal with anything unnecessarily when I came back (magic sentence right here.)

So here is the story for what I had to deal with that could've been avoided in the first 5 minutes of my day rather than going in circles for 2 hours.

IT Guy = Me

QC Lady = Important lady who inadvertently tried to save my day

As I'm walking in first thing 8am, users are already re-connecting their gear to get their day started. Almost instantly, I'm being pulled away to our plant because no one can get online.

IT Guy: Fuck. Did a switch goes out?

Right before I'm carted away, a user by the name of ""QC Lady"" stopped me and asked for help.

QC Lady: IT Guy, I reconnected my computer but I can't get online. Can you stop by and take a look?

IT Guy:  Give me a sec. The plant is apparently down. Let me take a look at that first and I'll stop by your office and see whats up.

I rush over and find all my gear in my cab online and working. What is even more interesting is that half the phones in the plant office cannot dial out or receive calls and all PCs have internet, but are having a hard time reaching resources across the LAN. I somehow manage to get the PCs behaving again, but the phones are still FUBAR. After a bit, I get a call that the president is having issues with wifi. Away I go!

I find the president with his laptop stating he cannot connect to our ERP. But he can access the internet. Strange, this is just like in the plant. I do some basic trouble shooting and decide to check what IP his laptop has so I can check the wireless controller.

Just for some background, my network is technically two physical networks. I have a Data network (192.168.1.x) with multiple VLANs to split off things like Guest Wifi, Corp LAN, MGT, etc. and a separate, flat Voice network (192.168.100.x). These networks are not connected. They never talk to each other because the VOIP vendor is finicky. Some of you will already know where this is going.

So I pull up an ipconfig /all on his laptop and see ""[192.168.100.138](https://192.168.100.138)""

IT Guy: ...what? WHAT?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I was furious because how the fuck is this machine getting this IP?

IT Guy: ...shit. I have a bridge somewhere.

I started panicking because this bridge could be literally anywhere. I have my MDF and a couple of IDFs littered about due to this operation spanning across multiple buildings.

So I took a step back from my panicking and logged into my core switch. Sure as shit, my ARP table has about 50+ more devices than what I'm accustomed to seeing. I needed a plan to try and get this resolved quickly. Because if I take too long, everyone will have finished re-connecting themselves and I'll never get anything done once the complaints start flooding in.

IT Guy: Ok. I can now see an entire network when I shouldn't be able to. How can I use this to find this fucking bridge.

So I started thinking. I know what's SUPPOSED to be on my Data network and vice versa. And I know of two devices that live in the MDF together, but do not talk to each other ever. So I grabbed the MAC of my firewall and the MAC on our VOIPs router. I know where my uplinks are supposed to be on all my IDF switches, so lets do some probing.

I log into all of my IDF switches at once, checked my ARP tables against my firewall's MAC and get:

G49, G50, G26, G50, G25

Ok. That's correct. Let's check the router

G3, G50, G26, G50, G25.

IT Guy: G3? Who is this?

I walk over to this IDF switch, find G3, pull out my phone that is un-fucking-fortunately on the VOIP IP range, and start pinging the VOIP router. I pull G3 and...

IT Guy: It stopped. What port is this?

I check my patch panel and its D16. I check the office this IDF is in and I find D16. Guess who it belongs to?

QC Lady: Hey! Ready for me? Did you fix the issue in the plant?

She had plugged in her phone correctly, but then plugged the PC port into D16, essentially bridging the two networks. I removed the cable, connected her PC correctly, re-connected G3 and for some reason heard Gordon Ramsay saying ""Finally. Some delicious fucking networking""

I'm sure there could've been an easier and faster way to find this bridge, but honestly I'm lucky that my method to find it worked and it was just a simple fix to reverse it.",Hurricane Dorian Aftermath,0
"My job technically has nothing to do with tech support.  We do have an IT person at work, who is responsible for that sort of thing.  But my office is over the road from the main building, and as the only person in our building who even approximates to technical competence, I am often the ""we can't be bothered to phone over the road to talk to the real tech support"" person, or the ""our tech support person is on holiday"" person, and end up doing the first level of troubleshooting.

Which leads to a lot of stupid questions.

Especially on Wednesdays.

Because I work in an archive, and Wednesdays are when our most technically inept volunteers are here.  And so, every Wednesday, I brace myself for a slew of exceedingly stupid problems which turn out in fact not to be the computer misbehaving at all, but our volunteers being unable to follow the most basic of instructions.

Which brings me to yesterday.

For context, some of our volunteers are working on a digitisation project, where they scan archive items on a flatbed scanner, and add metadata to the resulting files so they can be searched for.

So yesterday, my... &lt;sarcasm&gt;favourite&lt;/sarcasm&gt;... volunteer came into my office to tell me that there was a problem with one of the photographs that had been\* scanned.  Okay, I said.  What's the problem?  The problem is that it had been saved with the wrong filename.  Okay, that's easy enough to fix.  So I change the filename.  Next step: ask $volunteer to make sure that the label for the physical photograph records the correct filename, rather than the filename that it was incorrectly originally saved as.  $volunteer: ""Well, I didn't scan it.""  Okay, but it was meant to be in the box that they were working on.  So we look through the box, and sure enough it's not there.  Okay.  Wonderful.  Brilliant.

So $volunteer leaves the box they were working on with me, and leaves as they need to go.  I double-check the box.  Photo definitely still not there.  I check $volunteer's *other* box.  Photo not there either.  Okay.  Fine.  Great.

So I check the digital version of the photo for clues.  It was scanned last week, on the day that our problem volunteer was in.  Into the folder that they work in.  And it was scanned with a filename suggesting that it was in the box that they were working on last week.  Double check that box.  Still not there.  Go back to the file metadata.  `Owner: $volunteer`.  So much for ""I didn't scan it"".

Go into the office that volunteer was working in, to see if it had been left around somewhere there.  Not on the desk.  Open up the flatbed scanner.  Turns out that I have just wasted twenty minutes searching for the photo which the volunteer had left *in the flatbed scanner*, and somehow had failed to notice in five hours working at that workstation.

God only knows what they were *doing* in that time.

"My employer has to exchange data with other companies regularly using a special interface format and dedicated communication lines. For whatever reason, they decided to do this using IPv6 - not unusual today, but definitely unusual when your own hardware/OS combo does not support IPv6 at all and using an application protocol the server application was not able to digest.

To make this communication possible, they introduced a kind of gateway machine, translating IPv4 / IPv6 (easy) and $legacyapplicationprotocol / $newapplicationprotocol (also easy but not COTS). 

We received lots of calls that, whenever any of the local users had to do a manual server switch on that gateway (redundant components A and B, had to be switched regularly to ensure viability of standby component), chances were &gt;30% the server would shut down. Analysis soon showed that all of the users had been trained to do server switches using an application dialog window with all maintenance activities to choose from. 

During training, switchover had always been preselected as the default option and so they learned to just open the window and press &lt;ENTER&gt; (to execute the pre-selected switchover) and &lt;ENTER&gt; again to confirm the action. As you can imagine, most never even read the confirmation dialog.

The production version of the software was different in a small but crucial detail - the maintenance activities had been reordered in that selection window and so ""OS shutdown"" for whatever reason was the preselected entry - always a safe choice, right? A third of the users apparently never realised this because apparently they just did what they had been trained to do - open dialog, &lt;ENTER&gt;, &lt;ENTER&gt;. And because management had saved 20-30€ there was no IPMI / OBM access to remotely power the server on again...

Users were re-trained NOT to just use this ""fire and forget"" method, the rate of unintended shutdowns went down to maybe 20% - some users simply had apparently hard-wired the original training into their brain.

A few months later, we finally were able to convince management that this particular setup was not as brilliant as they thought. So after much deliberation, the SW vendor introduced a new activity in that selection window called ""do nothing"" and made this the default selection - far safer, although we then received calls stating ""server switchover doesn't work""...

I'm not technically in technology, but I have a development background, so end up getting involved and protecting a lot of our IT staff from stupidity...

Anyway, one of our long term sales reps, who is based in the middle of nowhere in Ohio (a 2 hour drive from Columbus airport) called in to tech support about 3 months ago stating that her laptop wasn't working.  We had our annual sales meeting in  June so we told her to bring the laptop with her as we always bring some of the IT folks for stuff like this.  She brings the laptop and IT lead notices battery is dead so charges it up and it turns on fine.  We tell sales rep, she confirms it's working now and we thought it was a fluke or maybe a bad charger so we gave her a spare charger.

The week after the sales meeting she emails and calls us to say that the issue is back her laptop won't turn on.  And she charged it all night with the new charger.  We start thinking something could be wrong, so we order her a replacement send it out and send her a box to send her laptop back in.  She confirms replacement is working and we received her laptop charged it up and it worked fine, so we ended up testing and reissuing it to someone else who didn't have any issues.

A few days go by and sales rep calls in again and tells us the same issue with her laptop, it's not turning on. We ran through troubleshooting and our IT lead did a facetime call with her and she was completely belligerent at this point. Yelling at me our IT staff and my manager who is the CIO of our division.

We ended up sending her multiple replacements and they would consistently stop working after about 3 days.  She sent an email to all our C level executives complaining about me and the IT staff that we keep sending her broken computers and don't understand laptops and that she wants one of us to come to her home office ASAP otherwise she's entertaining offers from competitors.  Well Head of Sales told us we needed to fix this...

She refused to come into us even though part of her territory is only 2 hours from us.  And since she made a big stink so my pregnant ass (yep I'm pregnant) had to fly to her last week.  She wouldn't even meet me in Columbus at a hotel, I had to drive 2 hours to her home office.

So I get to her home office and she shows me her laptop and the charger and what's going on....

The plug for the charger has a square back instead of a round one, it's almost the same shape as where the ethernet cord goes.  Guess where she was putting the charger...  So that is why her 8 or so laptops we sent her stopped working after 2-3 days, the battery would die because she wasn't charging it properly.  I taped a sticky on the top of her laptop with an arrow pointing to the left where the charger goes so she doesn't get confused.

She barely thanked me and told me it was my fault for changing our laptops from HP to Dell that there are too many square holes so how is she supposed to know where the charger goes.  I didn't make that call BTW, our parent company did because they had a better lease agreement.

And to make matters worse when I got there she said to me ""Oh you look puffy, have you gained weight?""  NO I'M PREGNANT, BUT NOT PREGNANT ENOUGH TO REALLY TELL ANYONE YET AND THAT IS WHY I'M PUFFY YOU A\*HOLE. I obviously didn't say that, but I told her it was from the flight and the 2 hour drive from the airport.

She's a jerk.

&amp;#x200B;

Update:  Wow I don't think I ever had this many upvotes on a post before!  I realized I left out a few things that I wanted to mention:

* We did ask her several times and sent her pictures of where the charging cord goes. She is the squeaky wheel in the top 5 sales people at the company so when she complains she gets heard.  After her initial facetime with us she refused to send pictures or get on a facetime with us so to satisfy the squeaky wheel we kept sending her new laptops.  
* IT Support made a betting pool before I left for Ohio then on vacation as to what he problem was.  I bet on the fact that she didn't have the charger plugged into the wall, not that she couldn't figure out where to plug into the laptop.  However, my favorite IT support person bet on this exact thing and won $285.  
* There isn't anyone else in IT local to her.  Our HQ is in NYC (where I'm from) and we only have IT staff in HQ where I""m based out of as well as in NJ.  We tossed around the idea of hiring a sub-contractor to work with us for this incident local to Ohio but in case something was really wrong with equipment we really needed someone from our team to handle. 
* While I was at the Columbus airport on Wednesday last week waiting for my flight back to LaGuardia I did write an email, which I saved in drafts, but sent today after reading some of your responses thanking her for hosting me in her quaint home town and that I was glad that it was just confusion on her part as to where the latptop charging cord gets plugged into and that we didn't have a more major equipment issue that needed to be addressed with Dell.  
* The money for the trip technically comes out of the IT budget, however, we are a shared service, so we will bill back to sales.  Because it was labor day week my flights were very expensive in and out of LGA as well as my lyft to and from the airport.  The whole trip was nearly $2000.  
* Before I left for vacation (today was my first day back in the office after the trip) I sent out a meeting invite to our head of sales and to my manager the CIO to review what happened and how we need to put proper process in place so we don't waste time or money.  
* Going to HR will be a lost cause, HR in this company only cares about the company not the employees.  It will be a he said/she said situation and not worth the drama. Plus I know I came out on top here.",I flew to Ohio because someone couldn't figure out how to charge their laptop,0

It's evening, I'm on the road for work, sitting in my hotel bar with a book and a pint. My phone rings and it's Oliver, an acquaintance from law school. They've got a problem. Someone at their small-ish law firm clicked on the wrong attachment and ransomware happened.  
  
Oliver:""You need to come here and fix this""

me:""Hey- Caught your email. Is this something I have to fix tonight?""

Oliver:""That's not the point""

Around 3pm, the post-lunch tiredness kicks in, then replaced with panic as I get dueling emails from Oliver and Alan. Oliver has written several paragraphs that I read as ""Alan's an asshole who doesn't know his place"".  
  
Alan's email is simply ""Stop the Stupid""    
  
I've got ten minutes before my next interview to fix this. I call Alan first. 
  
Alan:""Yep?""  
  
me:""I get that the stupid burns. Despite that, how's it coming?""  
  
Alan:""Bastards. Their outsourced provider is dumb. They kept dumping encrypted files back at us. After the fourth try, we got clean restores of the affected files, but some are as much as two months old. That MSP is horrible""
  
me:""Could you walk out right now?""  
  
Alan:""I'm running every scan I can to find and remove the malware before I give this dump back to them""  
  
me:""Right. You don't want to reinfect them""  
  
Alan:""And they're riding my ass on that. They don't think it's required""  
  
me:""Ok. Thanks. I'll talk to them and see if I can figure out what's going on""

me:""Well, he wants to make sure you don't reinfect...""  
  
Oliver:""That's just padding the bill""  
  
me:""If you think your existing IT staff can disinfect the file, that's your choice. You need some help, that's for sure""  
  
Oliver:""Listen. We'll pay Alan, but we still feel like we were taken for a ride. This took longer than it should""  
  
me:""Ok. I wish this had worked out better. Alan can finish soon and he'll leave the cleanup for your IT crew""    
  
I text Alan that he's getting paid and to leave the remaining work to the MSP. Oliver gets a longer email explaining the remaining work. 
  
Two weeks later, I get an email from Oliver. Turns out that the same lawyer tried to open the same (infected) document and, well,  they needed another referral, but someone cheaper this time as they were still sore about Alan.

"First time posting. I don't have any groundbreaking stories as of right now, -I've been verry fortunate with where I work- but this one happened yesterday and to me it was quite funny.

So for this to make sense, I work in a municipality over in Norway. Normally most IT here is outsourced to an external company but I was hired as an IT apprentice here last year and even that company has begun to rely on me if there is any on hand support needed at the town hall.

Everyone I work with are quite nice and appreciative, but despite this I do still have a few dificult ones. One co-worker in particular has this, I suppose, ironic attitude with technology. As long as it works she's not too bothered. Cue her getting a new vertical mouse and asking me to have a look at er setup as the mouse ""is unable to cross over to the next monitor.""

I decide to chek it out after lunch and after a few pointers I already see the problem. See how the setup is layed out there is the laptop on the left with the screen on, and two monitors running through a docking station. After rooting around I immediately see what the problem is. I open the screen settings to see what the adjustment of the screens are. As I may had suspected. The setup worked like so: 1(laptop), 3(monitor to the left), 2(monitor to the right). I had noticed that by some mysterious force... Screen number 3 was moved way up to high-heaven and the points of connection with the other sceens were not much more than a few centimeters at the bottom one.

I quickly took a photo of the screen, corrected the screen alignment and went back to show her the issue and got some laughs out of her other colleagues.",The mouse is not the problem,0
"This takes place in an ATC ACC (air traffic control  area control centre), so not exactly a low tech environment. 

A few years ago, at the simple TFT displays for a weather information display were due to be replaced at every single air traffic controller working position, approx. 800 in the whole company, 100 at our site. As working in ATC is as close to real paranoia regarding system failures can get, there is even a secondary system ready to provide weather updates on that display, using a different input port, in case the primary system fails, and users can manually switch between those systems e.g. in case of a hung system, by simply pressing a button on the display's bezel, thereby toggling the input source. 

The new displays arrived, were tested intensely for any faults and generally seemed to be much better than the old ones - after 10 years of 24/7 operations those were definitely not in their prime any more.

Soon after installation, we noticed that the new displays were prone to disastrous (as in ""dead"") failures whenever a user pressed the gleaming, stylish input selector button.

Who in their right mind would ever design a button with a decorative metal fitting around the metal button that, when short-circuited by the user's finger, would fry the display's electronics? The only way to switch sources without endangering anything was with a non-conductive pen or wearing gloves. WTF? 

The manufacturer had to modify all those displays, they certainly earned no money on that sale.",Who would have thought a button could actually be used...,0

Background: I work as a tech support agent for a home security company in the US. We serve customers in both the US and Canada. Fun stuff happens.

Names have been changed to protect the innocent

Me: Lowly but mighty tech support specialist

Also Me: My mind, where everything goes according to plan

Janet: Concerned and slightly pissed off woman

Coworker: Co-worker who has more experience installing and troubleshooting this kind of panel


Me: Illeterate tech support, this is u/Maldor96

Janet: My panel is making noise and and a ruckus at 11:30 at night and at an ungodly hour the next day. I want a tech to come out and replace it!

Me: Slow down there, we will consider a tech if we exhaust all options over the phone.

Also Me: Oh joy another one of these.

-Verification ensues-

Me: alright, let me take a look at the history and see what is going on, you said that this is happening at 11:30 or so?

J: Yes.

M: alright look me take a look at that time, is this happening regularly or randomly

J: randomly (calming down now that I'm looking)

AM: Nothing unusual happening here, odd requests for panel programming, but thats it.

M: Any other days this has been happening?

J: its been happening since last weekend

AM: More panel programming... things

M: Ok, let me run some tests and diagnostics on the panel

J: uhmmmhmm

-All tests good-

M: The tests didnt reveal anything...

AM: Shot in the dark, but what if we replicate those messages somehow, say changing the master code?

M: Ok, so this is a bit of a long shot but let me try something. 

J: Ok.

M: Did that set the panel off?

J: ... Nope

M: Ok... Well....

J: Wait it just said it

AM: Said it?

M: Said what?

J: It just said ""System disarmed, Ready to arm"" thats what it says every time.

AM: that is speech, not noise.

M: ooooooKkayy.... Let me do it again...

J: ...

M: ...

J: There! it said it again!

M: Huh, let me confer with a colleage of mine to get an extra set of eyes on this, because that is certainly odd. Is it alright if I put you on a brief hold?

J: Sure

-customer now on hold-

Coworker: whats going on?

Me: Customer is complaining about the panel saying the system disarmed message with no interaction on her side.

CW: Yeah, it does that. Its for letting the technician know that any changes he made have been applied.

M: Oh...

AM: I'll facepalm us later.

-speaking with the customer-

M: Hi, Janet

J: Yes

M: Turns out the the panel saying that is normal for when we are progamming the panel that tells us that the programming has been applied. In terms of the time, it looks like someone is accessing the panel information and that is what is causing the panel to say that. What I'm doing is forcing all devices signed into your account to log out. Once I do that, go ahead and log in yourself

J: So someone has been getting into my panel?

M: Yes, but it doesnt have a name attached to it, so its not us who is accessing it, but the log out command I sent will kick everyone off. If it continues to speak like that, give us a call and we can reset your password.

J: Ok, i'm logged in, so if it happens I'll call?

M: yep, and we will reset the password.

J: ok Thanks!

"It’s only tech support in the beginning, but it made me privy to this…

A few years ago, I volunteered for non-profit tech support helpline, mainly aimed at immigrants and recent arrivals in Germany – once a week we offered “bring your device, we’ll fix your problem” free of charge to anybody. 

One day Tony walked in. He was highly trained and specialized expert in his non-technical field, U.S. American by birth, who had been living and working in Germany for a few years. He wanted his computer set up so to anybody else it appeared to be in the continental U.S. My first impression was he maybe wanted to access some local/regional web site with geo blocking (making it impossible to access from IP addresses located outside the U.S.), which would have just meant to use a proxy server, but it was more serious – he wanted to “fake” living in the U.S. for the agency he bought health insurance from.

As his computer had several other issues, over the course of two or three hours his story came out piece by piece. Apparently, when he first came to Germany, it was under an American contract with his American employer who then had a separate contract with a German company. For this contracted, he applied for (and received) a working visa, and among the many papers he got was a leaflet about social security and healthcare in Germany, which stated (correctly) that with a foreign working contract you are not subject to German laws about national working contracts, and that e.g. health insurance had to be covered by his American employer, if at all. Obviously, his contract contained no health insurance, so he started buying “travel health insurance” for a few months at a time from different companies in the U.S. (to cover any medically induced costs while travelling abroad). After a year or two, his contract with the U.S. employer ran out and he was hired directly by the German firm he had been working for all the time. Again, he applied for (and received) a permanent residence visa, and again he got a lot of paperwork, which he didn’t read because to him it appeared to be duplicates of the ones he had when first moving to Germany.

The crucial difference was one particular leaflet – about health insurance and social security. As he didn’t read it, he did not know (and nobody thought to talk to him about it, as he seemed to be pretty much integrated into the community at the time) that comprehensive health insurance is mandatory in Germany, is deducted automatically from any salaries with a cost share of 50% paid by the employer and 50% by the employee. Not knowing this, he had thought he had no health insurance and continued to buy the (expensive) American health insurance contracts, always only for a few months at a time, and these contracts only covered emergencies.

The mystery how all the letters, e.g. the one welcoming him to the “default” health insurance agency (you can choose from 200+ different ones, but if you don’t choose explicitly, you just get assigned) and delivering his insurance card (which is accepted with any medical facility instead of payment) were not read either was easy to solve as well – apparently Tony thought them to be advertising for health insurance and just threw them away… but why he did not read his salary statement which had to include information about deductions for health insurance and social security... I have no idea.

So Tony came for tech support and left as a man with comprehensive health insurance.",Health insurance? Which health insurance?,0
"Preface: This \[GPS Company\] has its own GPS devices and software for updating and managing the devices \[Dock\].  


I get this lady in through chat who she says she spoke with \[GPS Company\] and was told she had something on her computer that was conflicting with the update. Of course, the moment they start spouting nonsense about the big, dangerous V, the customer takes it to heart and starts regurgitating that to me.   


I do my due diligence in getting connected to her computer, but being unfamiliar with \[GPS Company\] and it being outside my scope of support anyway, I focus on the software we provide and making sure her computer doesn't have anything on it to interfere with things. The computer is running just fine, no issues, I don't see anything she's talking about the guy from \[GPS Company\] saying, and advise she shouldn't be having any issue, but if she is, that it is likely an issue with the software itself.  


She insists on running a diagnostic scan on the computer, these scans generally take 1-2 hours, and of course I oblige with that fair warning. Scans come back with nothing really to remove and, again, the computer is pretty clean and good to go. After, to me, wasting my bloody time, I (out of irritation) asked her to start the software so I could see what's going on.  


She starts \[Dock\] and plugs in \[GPS Device\] and I notice right away that the software doesn't seem to be recognizing that \[GPS Device\] is plugged in. After telling her this, I see under File Explorer that the model the computer shows doesn't match what \[Dock\] was showing. As such, I try to verify with her what model she thinks she has.   


... she thought she had the model that is listed inside \[Dock\], but after a bit of prompting, she remembered that she has a different model (the one listed in File Explorer). . . And here's the kicker - the model that was listed in File Explorer is a Tablet model... and \[GPS Company\]'s website explicitly states that the Tablet models do not use \[Dock\] to update, but rather update going through the Tablet's settings menus.  


So TL;DR - Wasted time troubleshooting the computer when the manufacturer of the device/software having issues could've told the customer that the device she was using was incompatible with the software and she has different steps to follow to update it.","""I don't know my own stuff....""",0
"I felt like I needed to poke fun at myself for something that happened yesterday.

I was replacing a UniFi Cloud Key at our secondary site with an Ubuntu Server machine with the UniFi network controller software set up on it. The Cloud Key was a little bit underpowered to be handling captive portal, etc. Luckily, this will be an easy install. I have a fresh backup of the Cloud Key's configuration, all I have to do is put the new controller on the network and refresh from backup, change a few settings, and we'll be good to go.

Minor problem arises when I realize that the new network controller does not have the correct networking information in it. It's supposed to be set up for DHCP so I can see what free IP address it grabs, and then assign that IP address to it statically. It still has the static IP configuration from the main site where I was working on getting it set up -- forgot to change that bit. Oh well, not a huge issue. I pull out my crossover cable I keep in my bag and hook my laptop up to the server so I can SSH into it. All goes well, in a few minutes the server is all set up for DHCP.

So why isn't it pulling an address?

I spend about 30 minutes Googling. I've always dealt with the config files in /etc/network/interfaces, but Ubuntu uses netplan now, so I figured I botched that somehow. I look up from my laptop to think and my gaze rests upon the server, and on the way, my vision follows the crossover cable leading from my laptop to the server. But if the crossover cable is plugged in -- oh. So then I actually plugged the server into its switch and everything worked fine.

"Utility: the state of being useful, profitable, or beneficial.
In this context, anything positive, any outcome that brings you closer to something, **any** kind of gain on a universal or quantum scale.

Going straight to the story, will explain the title at the end, you'll get it better. The time of this occurance is end of August, begging of September (will be important later).

A couple days ago a colleague (Account manager - AC) replies to an email from a customer and copies my department in, as the customer is complaining about ""spam"". Too clarify if unaware, there is a difference between spam that you'd get from someone/something (spam contents and spam ""container"") and your website's contact form that is not protected against robots submitting it with spam content (spam content, legit ""container"").
And this is into a mailbox that technically doesn't even exist.

Anyway, as I was writing... AC replied, not only referring the customer to my department, but actually asking the customer if (in essence) it looks like either one or the other, and requesting to send over a couple of examples over; i.e. actually being helpful, unlike 80% of other colleagues.

A few days go by and AC forwards email from the customer (not from the customer directly to us, or as a Cc) that the customer sent ""as an example"". It goes as follows:

*Please se an example screenshot...*

What follows is a partial screenshot from webmail interface with a list of unread emails from **January to March of this year**, from page 101 out of 150. The lower three fifths of the page numbers and total number of emails are cut off, it doesn't show what the actual email address of the mailbox it is (and the closest email address that could match it has nowhere near so many emails); it shows only subjects, senders (not necessarily address) and dates.

This gives us literally nothing to go on, it's not even remotely helpful.

So here's the explanation on the title:

Customer's minuscule time spent on creating that email, the minuscule energy resources used to write the email (both the electricity to keep the computer running and biological energy the human put into writing it), the minuscule energy to transmit the message to our mailserver, the minuscule time and energy AC spent on the reply and forward and finally, the time I spent reading the email inspecting that quintessentially asinine screenshot.
All that for abso-freaking-lutely no use whatsoever, causing this entire chain of events, even with its minuscule use of general resources, it ends with a negative utility.

And of course this occurance doesn't have an ending, because it's about stupidity and spam, which are both infinite.",Email with a negative utility value,0
"Was working on an issue for a user; they called in using this program called ResWare.  We're going to call this user ""Rani"".

In ResWare, they export documents and such to MS office.  This is pretty standard with pretty much any LOB programs that do reports/finances en masse.  Okay, cool, traditional problem.  Here we go, boys.

So she calls in telling me that she's having issues with opening documents in office.  It was hard enough to understand with a combination of accent and the phone being muffled, but I like a challenge so let's see.  I remote in to the machine and see the issue, office is asking for creds when logging in.  Okay, so the product is unlicensed.  Simple enough.

At this point, I had Rani log in.  No good.  Wouldn't take creds.  Well, there could be a number of reasons for this but I don't feel like digging into them so I just had her try a few more times, same result.  Okay, fine.  I see how it is.  Site uses O365 though, so let's see if they can even log into that.

So I had Rani log into this and it didn't work.  Pass or username is no good.  Ha.  So it's a password problem.  But it's never that simple.  Here it comes.  You can feel it.  I felt it as soon as I saw those dreaded red letters.

Rani:  i shouldn't have to do that.  The passwords have always been different.

Inner Me:  ""I'm gonna have to do it to her.  I'm REALLY gonna have to do it to her.""

Me:  ""I understand that, but as of right now your account is synced with the server.  This means that every password that is like that will be the same.  Almost like one, big, easy to use system.  Makes life much more streamlined for you.""

Rani:  ""but I never had to do this before.""

Me:  ""Let's try something..."" \*locks computer\*  ""Login for me, please.""

Rani logs in, after saying something about it.  I noticed she typed in a stupid long password.

Me:  ""What password was that?  The one you said your email pass was wasn't anywhere nearly as long as that.""

Rani:  ""Yes, because the passwords are different.""

The inner me at this point is furious like that character from Inside Out.

Me:  ""They're linked together, so let's try that.""  After she logged in, this verified her AD account wasn't locked

Pass didn't work in O365, I'm guaranteeing she half-assed it but whatever.  I'm going to beat this issue to death if it kills me.  Tried it several more times, no good.

Rani:  ""I don't know why this is taking so long.  A previous tech from last week was able to do it in 2 seconds and it worked.  I don't know why this is so difficult.""

Inner Me:  ""Okay, so you're flipping telling me a tech did this LAST WEEK and did it completely wrong, which is why we're in this boat.  I wonder who that was.""

At this point she was getting that ""you don't know what you're doing attitude"" and I wasn't about to put up with that because it wouldn't have been good for either of us.

Me:  ""Okay, you know what...""  \*goes into O365 admin\* ""I'm going to reset your password in O365 here... and it'll work.

This account is going to work for an hour or two, maybe even a couple of days, BUT this system WILL sync back up to AD and your password WILL NOT WORK.  All right?""

I suspected at this point she didn't want to talk to me anymore because she wouldn't hang around to test her original issue; not being able to send files from Resware to office because her products were unlicensed.

Rani:  ""I'll call you back if there are any other issues.""

Me:  ""Mkay, here's your ticket number for if the issue reoccurs.""

Then I proceeded to put in the internal notes about this foolish interaction because I'm not falling on that sword and having my own competency called into question.  Nice enough lady to talk to, but as stubborn as a brick.","It's Active Directory synced, you're gonna get smacked if you do this",0
"This is the same person from one of my previous posts - the one who asked what kind of toner goes in scanners.  


I was working on a printer. It was having ghost print issues. I cleaned the printer and it was doing better, but still had some slight black lines. I had the next day off, therefore my coworker decided to take a look at it. This printer had a brand new maintenance kit in it. And new toner. My coworker decided to get a transfer roller ordered even though the one in the printer was fine.  


Transfer roller came in and i went by to switch out the rollers. The printer was unplugged by the time I got there. I swapped them out and turned on the printer. Started printing test pages and the quality was SO much worse. Much more black lines. I figured it just need to print a couple more and it would even out. The printer was already printing out whatever was in queue and it ended up stopping and the error message said there was a jam within the fuser. I was like ""that's weird..."" I turned the printer around and took out the fuser (someone actually JAMMED the fuser in there so it took some time to get it out. Amazing). Unfortunately no image links are allowed, so I can't share how awful the fuser got torn up, but basically imagine a new tech item being shredded. That's how the inside of the fuser looked.

"There I was, a fresh faced 22yo newbie to the world of IT Support.

I was one month into my new job, supporting Post Offices up and down the UK at Fujitsu, and yet to experience any down right stupidity when an old girl from the west country we will call Doris called through complaining that her only till wasn't working. After trying to diagnose what ""it isn't working"" means for was around 10/15 minutes, I gather that the PC unit wasn't powered on. I was frustrated that such a trivial problem took so long to diagnose, but it oughta be plain sailing from here...

90 minutes of trying to describe what the 'base' unit looked like, where it was positioned and so on began to suggest that the fucking thing wasn't there. Doris was absolutely insistent that nothing that was, ""about 6 inches wide, 18 inches tall and made of black metal/plastic with several small LED lights next to a gold power button"" existed under her counter, and more so, that she'd never had one and that her till was just ""the monitor and the keyboard"" were all she'd ever had.

Just as I was about to give up on life, this exchanged happened:

**Doris**: ""You know, I think I can see the small black thingy you're talking about my love"",  
*Vurbetan: ""fantastic, can you just see if there are any lights on, or if not, see what happens when you press the power button please?""*  
**D:** ""Oh I'm sorry, there are definitely no lights on this box. Just a silver button in the middle.""

I wasn't aware of any units with silver power buttons, but perhaps this was an older unit...

*V: ""It could be difficult to see the lights under the counter if the unit is off, are you able to press the button?""*  
**D**: ""No dear, it doesn't press in.""  
*V: ""It doesn't press in? Is it stuck? Does it look like it should press in?""*  
**D**: ""It doesn't press in. It's sticking out"".  
*V: ""It's sticking out? Does it look physically damaged?""*  
**D**: ""No no no, it looks like it's supposed to be like that.""

At this point I'm completely stumped, there's no tech there matching Doris' description of this box.

**D**: ""There are numbers.  
*V: ""Sorry, numbers? Where are they?""*  
**D**: ""On the silver thing.""

*V: ""Is it on?""*  
**D**: ""It doesn't appear to be my love""

**D:** ""Yes okay, one moment.""

"My friend was asked to look at an old printer that was still in use at a post office. Small issues would come up that were easy fixes. Paper not feeding right, not registering the ink cartridge, all around not wanting to print. They were simple fixes.

Then the computer software was upgraded. The clerk called my friend over to ask how to log out. A while later she asked if he was willing to look at the printer. The computer didn’t recognize the printer at all and needed to be reinstalled. 

A while later he went up and looked at the computer. There were a list of options. He decided to look at the manual installation list. The list was of every printer that could be installed on the current OS. The printer wasn’t on that list. 

He told the clerk that, it doesn’t look like the computer has drivers for the printer and so the printer can’t be connected to it. 

She looked at my friend and smiled. Thank you. I’m glad it wasn’t just me that was the problem. She walked over to the postmaster and told him that my friend looked at it and couldn’t get it working. 

The postmaster asked what is wrong. It’s so old that the current set up doesn’t have the drivers for it to work. The only way is to replace it. He shrugged saying,oh well. I was trying to replace it anyway. Now we have a good reason too.",Unofficial USPS IT guy - 6,0

This is a story about me, trying to fix something and nearly fuck up.

Disclaimer: non nativ english, on mobile, only the management approved go to in-house tech-savvy unofficial it guy


Everything started with a coworker complaining that she isn't able to send anything to the plotter. Of course this, story has to involve a printer, hasn't it?
After she left for the day, I sat down at her Desk and tried to fix, this printer issue. After some tries to get it running by fiddling around in its settings, I decide to remove the printer and it's driver to reinstall it.

Error: ""Can't do this. Resource is being used by printspooler.""

Okay, simple. Restart PC into safe mode and try it from there.

Win + r

msconfig

Entering admin credentials

Check ""Boot to safe mode minimal"" 

Reboot


PC rebooted and I tried to get to the system configuration.
As it wouldn't accept the admin credentials, it dawned to me that it wasn't the best idea, to cut the connection to the network, where the admin user was located.
I had no idea, if there was a local admin user. And as it only would reboot into safe mode, I had manage to brick this pc, 'cause without the local admin credentials I could not get back into the msconfig window. 

I was, considering my options. Declaring defeat and call our ""actuall IT guy"" to fix it, which could take from a few, hours, up to a, week or two before he would show up, or I could try to fix it my self.

I opened up Google on my pc and started searching.

I found something about registry editing via cmd which it wouldn't let me do.

And after some time and trying I read that you could change the safe mode  by getting into the system, recovery screen.

Boot - forced shutdown
Boot - forced shutdown
Wiping the sweat of my forehead
Boot - please wait - system recovery

There I clicked ""safe mode with network"", rebooted and was able to get out of safe mode eventually.


While doing this all, I remembered that the print spooler is a service, which should be listed in the task manager.

After logging in, I stopped the spooler, went to the print drivers, clicked remove and

Error: ""can't remove driver - print spooler not running""

This one was not so easy.

I ask the provider about the usual: line history, stats and outages, nothing of interest.

VENDOR: ""I see the line is up and the modem uptime is 5 days, so the customer did not restart it. Since the troubleshooting was not performed, we will close this ticket.""

IFIX: ""Hold on, actually yes they did restart it, 5 days ago. the problem started a week ago. It did not solve the problem. I told you that 3 minutes ago.""

VENDOR: ""Ok we are seeing no issues with the service, can I help you with anything else?$

IFIX: ""Yes, you can check the modem for the settings I asked you to. I don't care if you see it configured ""correctly"", what is correct to you may not be correct for me.""

"I must admit - the following happened to me and it took me ages to find the trivial solution.

At a teaching hospital, everybody had just gotten used to that newfangled computer stuff when the grown-ups decided to upgrade to a networked structure, which before the turn of the century was not really common. The network was installed, and on Day X the supplier dropped approx. 200 preconfigured PCs at the loading Dock to distribute to their designated locations. 
Being just a lowly IT support engineer, I got to do most of the physical job, whereas my more senior colleagues gathered around the PDC (primary domain controller, like a login authentication server) to greet each new machine appearing on the network with cheers.
After all the hardware was accounted for and every single PC seemed to work just fine, we even got thanked by the clinic manager.

A few days later, calls started coming in about people not being able to log into their user accounts, but there was no systematic behaviour we could pinpoint - on some days, a user at position A had a problem but his login credentials worked just fine on position B, whereas the opposite was true a few hours later. Users kept moving through the building to find computers where they could log in, quite often ending up in neighbouring departments. 

Management was not concerned, as they expected teething problems for the new systems anyway, so no systematic approach to fault isolation was requested. 

Careful plotting of the problem reports showed a pattern after some time - there were always the same clusters of computers involved. If A worked, B and C would always have the problem and vice versa. Same with D, E and F respectively. Finally it dawned on me - the supplier had preconfigured three batches of 60 odd computers each, changing the hostname between batches but not the IP (network) addresses - so whichever PC from a group of identically configured started first ""won"" as the switch would reject the others as being duplicated IP addresses.

As those were smart clients, no fancy network boot etc., the only indication was the inability to log in as the PDC was unreachable to the ""clones"". The actual fix was easy, less than a day of manually deconflicting the IP addresses  and everything was done. Supplier was sooo embarrassed...

"I support a few different products, all of which have passwords that periodically expire.

(I am not a character in this story as i merely observed from the back of the store)

When we book in a phone for repair we ask the customer to provide us with their password so that once the repair is complete we can ensure things like the camera and spearkers are in working order. If they dont want to provide the password thats fine, we just have them sign in upon collection to let us test. This particular customer was happy to give us the password when he left his phone with us. There starts the tale.

&amp;#x200B;

So, earlier on an average Tuesday shift we had repaired a customers iPhone screen (7 iirc) and they had since collected and paid for it.  A few hours later, the customer, a lad of about 17 i would guess, comes back in to the shop, this time accompanied by a female friend.

My manager recognises the customer.

M: ""Hi, is everything OK with the phone?""

C: ""Actually, i am having an issue with unlocking my phone, i am entering my password but its keeps saying its incorrect, now its locked for 15 minutes""

As soon as the customer finishes his sentence, it happens. The female friend (Also about 17) slams her palms onto the counter and snarls at my manager.

CF: ""It's because you've changed the f---ing password!""

Total silence while my manager takes in what she has just said, then he addresses the boy.

M: ""It is likely that you are just entering the password wrong, but if you have all of the details we can help you reset your phone if you are certain you are entering the password correctly. Also, we would never change your password, we have no reason to, we only use it to ensure the work is completed correctly and it is not worth our reputation as a business to misuse your information""

My manager then turns to the girl.

M: ""As for you......YOU CAN GET THE F OUT OF MY SHOP RIGHT NOW!""

The girl looks so stunned i think she might be about to break into tears.

CF: ""You cant speak to me like that i'm only 17!""

M: ""Just did....BYE!""

The girl, clearly out of her depth actually just turns around and leaves. The boy scoops up his phone and quickly follows, apparently forgetting about his problem.

The next day the boy returns, this time with his grandfather. We then learnt that the boy HAD infact been entering his passcode wrong and that the phone was fully functional. However the grandfather was here to complain about how we had spoken to his grandson and his friend. Young lad looked pretty smug until my manager explained the situation from the previous day.

&amp;#x200B;

Immediate 180 from the old guy, apologised for his grandsons behaviour and assured us the girls parents would be notified of her actions as well. My manager assures him its no problem and he bears no ill will.

Grandfather and Grandson leave the shop together, Grandfather wearing the face of a man about to explode and the Grandson wearing the face of a boy who knows that explosion is going to be directed at him.

"Your intrepid contract field service tech goes out for another service call today. Issue: “restore primary internet connection”. It’s 100 miles from home at a restaurant in a major US city. 

That turns out to be simple. The broadband provider Ethernet cable is unplugged from the modem. But it’s complicated by the fact that our MSP (my customer) hasn’t recorded that we updated the solution on site a few months from a brand “C” router and VoIP provider #1 to a brand “F” UTM device and switch and VoIP provider #2’s service/equipment. That eventually gets sorted out (I sent the support line a photo to prove that the new equipment was there). 

The manager mentioned that since the phones were replaced, they don’t have time to pick up before it stops ringing. The phones are a VoIP DECT system. One base station, up to four handsets. 

Site is configured with a main number that has an auto-attendant that is supposed to transfer to a busy message or some such if they’re too busy to answer after nine rings, but it isn’t going anywhere near that long. 

It turns out that the base station has its own internal logic for call handling. The base station was provisioned with a “call forward no answer” rule and timeout of 18 seconds, which was just about enough to emit three rings before forwarding to VM using its internal rule. 

We adjusted that to the max of 120 seconds, so the auto-attendant’s rule prevails. I would argue that 40 or so seconds still isn’t long enough, but it’s twice what they were getting.",Calls forward to voicemail after three rings,0

"So my company deals with web software, you can install it on a VM or HyperV or Azure or whatever. 

Customer calls in, ""Hey, we can't get to the server. The website is down.""

I check. Website is up, but a bit slow. 

Me: ""Huh, looks like it's still up for me. Maybe this is a local problem. Can you get to other websites?""

Them: ""No it's the server, it's down. No one else in the office can get there"". 

I was working from home, so I use my work laptop to VPN into the office and check through that. Sure enough, no website comes up. 

Me: ""Huh, this seems like a weird network problem. You should talk to your network guys and see if they can resolve this. I'll keep the ticket open.."" blah blah blah

30 minutes later, the call in, they have an Azure dude (they're hosted in Azure), a network dude, and the administrator. 

Them: ""It's not network related. I get a login prompt when I SSH to the server. That means it's not network related""

I check some things out, and so do they. We determine that it's a 50/50 shot of the website being able to load, but if it doesn't load on a specific machine, it's consistent. Unless they change the network the machine is on, it will consistently either not load, or consistently load. 

So, obviously, this is pretty weird, but I can't imagine any universe where it is the server. 

Eventually, they find a server within the network, and I ask them to load the admin interface to see resource usage. 

Surprisingly, they can. Everything is running. All the services are go. The CPU usage is nominal. Ram is fine. Storage is running low, so they add half a terabyte in Azure. Other than that, it's fine. 

Me: ""So this is really looking like a network issue""

Them: ""This is 100 percent NOT a network issue! Yell scream scream!""

I try to ask probing questions to figure out how they think it could be a server issue (I don't fix networks, I fix servers, the customers network is none of my business). They're evasive. They mention F5 load balancers but assure me ""It's not that"". They think it could be NTP, and try to debug the NTP server in their domain until I point out that the server uses pool.ntp.org and that the time is correct. They troubleshoot everything except the network. I try to zone out of the situation and work on something else while still on the phone with them, but they keep trying to wrap me back in even after it's pretty much 10,000 percent confirmed it was the network. They demand I get into the backend and poke around. 

Services are fine. Everything is fine. Server is fine. 

I hand it over to the later crew, even though this is definitely not our problem, but keep an eye on chat just because I'm curious how this goes. 

At the end of it all:

1: They are using the company's static IP as the a-record for the domain

2: Requests made to the static IP are NAT'd to Azure 

3: They get there through a VPN

Apart from this being absolutely mind-blowingly stupid, it actually worked, but before it did, you know what ended up fixing it for them?

They re-started their OTHER firewall. 

There were over 5 hours logged in that call when I was already pretty sure what the problem was in the first 5 minutes.",It's not network-related.,0
"I'm not sure where this tale belongs, but since it happened during my tech support days, it may as well go here.

Also, my original submission was rejected due to content, so I've had to disguise some of the content of this post.  So, if you can figure out what 890 + 10 means when it is an area code in the United States... well, let's just pretend that's reserved for calling &lt;Weather Services&gt;.

No TLDR because I think this story is worth the read.

This took place in the early 90s, and I was the head of a two-person computer department. The company was a boutique management consulting firm with many of our clients being the middle management and C-suite executives for a considerable number of the Fortune 500 firms.

We had a decent computer system setup in those days. A bevy of Macs for the graphics department making the presentation slides for the consultants, and 8-10 PCs in a dedicated room for number crunching. This was a few years before a Cat-5 run to each desk was commonplace, so a central computer room was pretty much the norm for a professional services firm.

While my primary responsibilities were for the PCs and my #2 (hereafter MacDude) was responsible for the Macs, there was one system that was largely left to its own devices with minimal intervention; the AT&amp;T Unix-based PBX in the phone closet. We had about 75-100 people in that location and had acquired the system when moving into that space. I'm pretty sure it was leased, as that's how AT&amp;T worked back then, but billing was never my strong suit, so I didn't pay much attention to such details. Whenever I got an email telling me an AT&amp;T tech was coming in to perform an upgrade or some such, I'd meet them in reception and walk them over to the phone closet and let them do their thing. Once or twice we'd had some urgent issues, and I had called AT&amp;T tech support and they'd walked me through logging in at the console and checking some stuff, so at least I knew the customer admin password and could login if needed.

So one day I'm sitting at my desk, probably programming HyperCard to update the phone directory, when our Comptroller Guy (Compie) walks in holding that month's phone bill.

""Hey Jack, do you know anything about the phone system?""

""I know how to make a call and answer a call. What would *you* need beyond that?""

""Funny. Can you tell me who made a specific phone call?""

""Maybe. The PBX has a console and I can probably figure something out. Let's go take a look.""

So, we wander over to the phone closet and I log in. I spend a few minutes exploring menus and eventually find the reporting system. It's actually pretty straight-forward, and I take the number from Compie and enter it into the search field.

""Yeah, it looks like it was called about 12 times from these three extensions.""

""Whose extensions are those?""

""Let's see... looks like Conference Rooms 6, 8 and 11.""

""So there's no way to to tell who called that number?""

""Not unless there are video cameras that I don't know about.""

""Okay... thanks.""

""Why are you asking?""

""I can't tell you.""

Even as early as that in my career, I knew when not to pry. ""Okay, let me know if you need anything else.""

I think two or three months went by before Compie was back at my desk.

""Hey, Jack; can we go look at the call log again?""

""Sure, which number this time?""

""Same one and two others.""

He gave them to me and back we went.

""Looks like a total of 43 times in the past three months.""

""Damn it. What the hell?!""

I looked at Compie. Normally a pretty laid back guy, he was genuinely upset.

""What's going on?""

""Let me go ask Dave if I can tell you. I'll be right back.""

Dave was the president (and one of four founders) of the firm and my boss. If he was involved and making Compie keep it quiet, there was something serious going on. Five minutes later, Compie comes back, closes us into the phone closet and tells me to dial one of the numbers on speakerphone.

""&lt;Hey there, are you making plans for the weekend?  Well, I can't wait to tell you just how hot the weather is going to be.&gt;"" As the intro spiel goes on, I look up at Compie with my jaw gaping open.

""Someone's calling a &lt;Weather Service&gt;? We have a block on &lt;WS&gt; numbers.""

""But it's not a &lt;WS&gt; number in the US; it's somewhere in the Caribbean."" Compie shows me the phone bill. Sure enough, the call detail listed the various call destinations as being in Costa Rica, Honduras and, if I recall correctly, the Dominican Republic.

""Huh.""

""He's been doing it for three months now.""

""And charging it to the firm?""

""No, the calls are only for a minute, and that's how long their introduction is. It's the long distance charges that are starting to pile up.""

Sure enough, the call detail log showed that all calls to a specific number were all the same duration, roughly a minute.

""Dave wants this person tracked down. Can you do it?""

""Yeah, sure. Give me a bit to look up all the source extensions.""

But every single one was from a conference room (except for a few from Compie's line obviously). This guy knew to cover his tracks. Reluctantly I told Compie no luck.

This went on for months. Every month Compie would bring me the new phone bill log so that I could note the new numbers being used. The guy started out fairly modestly (compared to later), but as time went on, he seemed to get emboldened by his getting away with it. The calls became more frequent, and he got to the point where he would hang up and call the same &lt;Weather Service&gt; multiple times in a row. I think his record was one number 15 times in a row. And there was no pattern to it, other than always being from a conference room phone. Not once did he slip up and call one of the numbers from his desk phone. Another thing that puzzled us was that there would be days where dozens of calls were made, but none on the next day or the day before. It seemed totally random.

It took so long to find out who he was that we discovered that the PBX only stored a month or two of log data (hard drives were expensive back then), so I had to figure out how to export the records to a floppy disk and save them on my computer. I used FileMaker Pro to store the data and later used it to analyze the records.*

After nine months of this, Dave was not happy. One of the few times we discussed it he told me his biggest concern. ""Jack, if I knew this was absolutely confined to calls made from this office, I'd be less concerned. But I am going to be pissed if this is a consultant and he's making these calls at the client. The last thing I need is a CEO asking me why my consultants are calling &lt;Weather Services&gt; from his office.""

""The days when there aren't any calls made here; I hadn't thought of that.""

""That was the first thing that occured to me when I saw those gaps."" There was a reason he was the boss.

""Okay Boss, we'll figure it out.""

And we did. Once the light bulb went off for how we would catch him.

If he never called a &lt;Weather Service&gt; from his desk, maybe we could tie him to calling a different number that no one else in the firm ever called.

And that *was* how we caught him.

One thing we knew about conference rooms is that they were in short supply and it was not uncommon for calls to run over and the next person/team to be knocking on the glass wall pointing at their watch(es) to indicate to the occupants that their time slot was up and they needed to vacate the room for the next team to use it. We actually watched and timed multiples times how long it took for a call to end and the people inside to pack up and leave and the next call to start.

We settled on a maximum gap between calls of 8 seconds. Any longer than that, we couldn't assume the call was made by the same person.

While this methodology certainly cast our net wider, all the numbers that we could positively tie to having been dialed by the same guy were either client main numbers or local businesses, etc., that were also called from many personal desk phones throughout the firm. We were beginning to think he would never slip up.

But, like all bad guys, he eventually did. I think it was a year after Compie first came to me that we hit paydirt. Two calls to a local &lt;meteorologist's clothing store&gt; with a &lt;humid&gt; message on the answering machine in the same month, one from a conference room tied to a &lt;Weather Service&gt; call, and one from a personal desk line. Once we had a suspect, we knew what we had to do, as we had spent a good amount of time over the months brainstorming how to verify who the culprit was.

I would try to visually verify that this guy was in a conference room while a &lt;Weather Service&gt; call was being made. If I recall correctly, I could flag a number and have the system send a notification to me once a call to a specific number had ended. But I think I was limited to a set number of numbers to monitor, so I was guessing if he would stick to the current crop of numbers or being trying out new ones this month. I would get a notification, run to the phone closet, run the search to figure out the conference room, run to the conference room to see who was in there, and then run back to verify another &lt;Weather Service&gt; was called during my running around. It took me a week to visually verify that it was the guy we thought it was.

MacDude, a *really* laid back guy and very non-confrontational decided that he would try to prove innocence, because he didn't want it to become a witch hunt. He went to Compie and requested all the guy's timesheets, trying to see if any call was ever made while when the guy had in his timesheets that he was at a client. Ironically, this was the nail in the coffin for the guy. The timesheets and the call logs lined up perfectly. Not once was a &lt;Weather Service&gt; line called when the guy was at the client.

It turned out we both finished on the same day. We compared notes, agreed we were right, and went to Dave's office.

""Hi Dave, thanks for seeing us on such short notice. We know who it is; it's GQ**. We can walk you through the proof if you want.""

""Are you absolutely sure?""

""No question. It's GQ.""

""Okay, I'll handle it from here. Tell no one about this.""

And that was it.

About three or four weeks later, that standard exit email went out from GQ: ""Thanks for the memories and good luck in your future"". It seemed that GQ had decided it was time to move on to greener pastures and was taking a position with a different company in one of Boston's suburbs.

But, man, I wish I had been able to be a fly on the wall when Dave confronted GQ. As Dave was ex-military, it would have been an epic dressing down.

-=-=-

\* God I miss FileMaker Pro; what a great little personal database app.

\*\* Why did i use GQ? This was also one of the big puzzlers to us. GQ was just that; a guy who could very well have been on the cover of GQ. Very attractive, one of the sharpest dressers I've ever known (French cuffs/cuff links and matching collar pin every day, the primary shirt color matching tie and pin-striping, the whole ensemble clearly from a high-end men's fashion shop), hair and beard meticulously maintained, a genuinely good guy who never treated the support staff badly. And he was literally married to a &lt;meterologist&gt;. A smoking-hot, regionally-known &lt;meterologist&gt;.

Yet he was compelled, obsessively so, to call these &lt;Weather Service&gt; lines.

I haven't checked on him in years. I hope he found help and ended up in a good place.","""The weather this weekend is going to be hot and humid.""",0

TS: But the customer lives in New Mexico! It's not zero in New Mexico, I looked it up.

Me: .... The address entered is in Oregon. If they enter an address in New Mexico, it'll calculate the tax for New Mexico.

Me: ... There are two options, change the address to one in New Mexico, or move forward with the Oregon address with the appropriate sales tax.

"Another day as a tech support. We have had some newbies coming in for level 1 for a few weeks now. One ticket came in as stated below.

&gt;Issue : Random emails keep missing from $User's mailbox.   
&gt;  
&gt;T/s done : New ost created, new profile created, run as safe mode, crosschecked on OWA, repaired and reinstalled Outlook  
&gt;  
&gt;Issue stated : Unknown. $User just realized that she has been missing the emails when a colleague ask her why didn't she replied. Since then $user has been noticing even newer emails gets missing.

Upon checking the ticket, ticket has been touched by numerous agents from different teams before landing in my bin. 

Complaint ticket has been made since it has breached our SLA. User was really unhappy. (sigh, here we go again)

$Me : Hi $User, I'm calling in regards of your ticket Tix123456. For the missing emails issue, if you have a moment right now, may I remote in and take a look and find the emails.

$User : Hi there, finally. Hopefully you can try better than the rest before you. Look, I don't want my profile to be recreated anymore. Last time the guy did it, it took me hours just to get my whole mailbox back. And just so you know, they already reinstalled my Outlook a few times. All of that didn't work. All of that just wasted hours of my time.

$Me : I understand and I will try my best not to repeat the same steps as before. Please save and close down all important documents before I remote in.

$User : Yeah yeah, go on. Just to be clear, the missing emails are not only from a specific sender. It's like it has a mind of it's own. I can confirm that the emails missing, one of them is regarding a party we're about to throw for our mate's birthday. The other one, its about working forms.

&gt;After getting connected, I opened up Outlook and the first thing I noticed is that $user had hundreds of sub, sub-folders etc. Pretty sure it must've gone in one of those. 

$Me : Can you show me some examples of an email that you are sure it's missing. You can ask your colleague to forward it to you but you will need to rename the subject. 

&gt;$User proceed to talk to the colleagues that's sitting next to $user and asking to forward some emails while trash talking about IT. It went something like this; ""*Hey, I'm on the phone with one of the IT people again. I don't think she knows what shes doing. She had been clicking here and there and now she wants one of you to forward the email that was missing from my mailbox.""*  I couldn't hear the rest of the conversation, but I heard the tone on how the all laughed. 

$User : Hey, how many emails do you want? My colleague already sent one, and I don't see it still in the inbox.

$Me : 3 should be sufficient. Please change the subject of the email.

$User : But she did. Don't you think we already tried this multiple times? The same missing emails will never show up.

$Me : Okay. Please ask your colleague to put ""Test"" as the subject.

&gt;""*What is this girl trying to do? We've done it a dozens time. Babe, can you send it again with the subject  ""test""?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Ding! The email came in. I scrolled down the see the previous subject : ""Forms to resubmit""

$Me : Great, now do the same with 2 more different emails.

&gt;Ding! 2nd email previous subject : ""Outfit Reminder for $colleague's Party""  
&gt;  
&gt;Ding! 3rd email previous subject : ""Fwd : $Company Pvt Limited : $InvoiceTitle""

"TL;DR

Developer with a little knowledge of sysadmin wanted me to clone another machine to fix a problem instead of adding code that would give me the information needed to fix the problem.

Back story: I was a Windows programmer in the days of ""n-tier"" and ""R.A.D."" I did Java/DB and VB/DB work. I hated it so I became a Linux sysadmin instead. I've been a Linux sysadmin now for about 20 years.

Now I'm a Senior Linux sysadmin for an unnamed contracting company in an unnamed city. One of my jobs is to help developers diagnose problems with their applications.

On one of the teams the lead is a very quiet, very polite lady that does Java/Tomcat development. One day she comes to me after an application stops accepting uploads.

Me: Ok, I'll tail the logs, you try the upload.

Dev: \[does so\]

Me: Ok, I see the error, but it is really vague. (It's just a generic java error about a particular module)

Dev: Well, you can see it doing the same thing on my local. (English is not her first language.)

Me: I understand, but that is the same error. I need more information before I can troubleshoot the error. Not to mention that your laptop is a Windows 10 machine and the QA server is a Linux box. (I wish the company would get the developers to do their development work on a Linux machine, but I suppose that would mean training them and having to support it, but on the other hand....)

Dev: But its the same error on my local.

Me: I know, but before I can diagnose, I need more information. Try adding a statement to do this. \[I describe the idea\]

Dev: \[makes some minor changes that are not what I suggested and runs it on her laptop\] See, there is the problem!

Me: Again, this is a Windows laptop and the server is a Linux box. I \*need\* more specific information from the Linux box itself, not your Windows laptop. Please, add the appropriate logging code.

Dev: Um.... I don't want to do that because it will generate a Jira ticket.

Me: (Internal Facepalm) Um... Ok, but I can't diagnose it without more detailed information. ( She doesn't want to do the work to fix the problem because it will generate a ticket in the ticketing system that tracks bug fixes and new feature development.... huh? )

Dev: Can you check the permissions? (Often, the problem is just a simple permissions issue. The developers know this, and it's their first line of questioning when something breaks. However, I have already done this.)

Me: I checked the permissions before you came over. They are what they are supposed to be.

Dev: Could you check again?

Me: Sure. (Internal eyeroll. I do the appropriate commands to set the permissions in full view of the developer, and kindly and patiently show her the results. I check SELinux just to be sure. It's in permissive mode.)

Dev: Ok, Let me try...... No... still broken.

Me: As a test, I'll run the application as root. (This is a bad idea, but it will prove the permissions aren't the problem)

Dev: I'll try.... no... still broken.

Me: Well, it's not a permissions issue. The application is running as root.

Dev: But it's not working.

Me: I understand, but root has access to \*everything.\* It's not a permissions issue.

Dev: Can you check the permissions again?

Me: The permissions aren't the issue. They were correct before we started and now the application is running as root.

Dev: Well, can you clone the staging machine, which is working?

Me: (Internal Facepalm!!! At one point we had a problem with a server and after checking everything to the smallest detail, like settings for each application, permissions, boot settings, a partridge in a pear tree and also checking the settings between the broken machine and the working staging machine. we solved it by cloning the working staging machine. I wish the developers didn't know we could do this! )

Me: Um, no. The SAN that holds the VM Image is nearly full. There isn't enough space.

Dev: Well, it's this on my local.

Me: I understand, but that is a Windows box, and I need to see more detailed information...........

After going round and round like this for a couple more minutes, she leaves, defeated. I haven't heard back from her. I don't know what the resolution was. Since the problem affected one of the core functions of their application, it would be a major problem for them to not be able to test it. I would be very surprised if they left it broken. I can only assume that they found that it was a code problem and fixed it and didn't tell me. Also, if they had gone to my boss and he fixed it, I would have heard about it.

What frustrates me most is that I don't come to their desks and dictate code to them. I \*barely ever\* suggest anything like logging code. Ugh....",I don't want to do that.....,0
"Sorry for the length and formatting; been a really long day.-------------------------------Ever had a user get unreasonably angry and start screaming at you? Well, here's one of mine:

My job at the time was still using Office 2011 on Windows 7 and it was already outdated. There was a bug where local pst files would get too large and Outlook would just... die; the whole machine would lock up until you killed outlook. The issue was, it would kill the program, but the process would remain 'running' and be locked up completely. Reopening outlook without rebooting the machine would only lead to the machine locking up and nothing responding at all. Solution at that point was only to reboot.

We'll call the user ""Bob""

Bob calls down to my desk-

Me: ""Hey Bob, what can I do for you?""Bob: ""You need to fix this computer. It's acting up and won't let me do anything.""Me: Sure; I take it you're not able to put in a ticket. Let me head on up and I'll take a look.""

I head up and step inside Bob's cubicle, immediately seeing the issue described above.

Me: ""Hey, Bob... I know you hate hearing this but I can see what's going on right now; your Outlook is acting up again and you're going to need to restart.""

Bob goes nuts: ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HAVE TO RESTART!? RESTART! RESTART! THAT'S ALL YOU EVER SAY! WHY CAN'T YOU JUST FIX THIS ISSUE THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE TO RESTART ALL THE D&amp;$N TIME!?"" (caps because he's actually screaming this right outside the executive director's office)

Me: ""Look, I know you hate it but unfortunately until I can convince \[my boss\] to let me purchase new licenses to upgrade everyone or let me change everyone to server-side storage, there isn't another fix to this particular issue.""

Bob: ""THAT'S JUST GREAT. WHAT THE F\*$( DO YOU EVEN DO HERE, HUH!?""

I cut him off: ""Look, my job is to make sure that our infrastructure and user machines are working and to fix what I can when they aren't. My job is *NOT* to be screamed at and treated this way. Either you calm down and we can get you back up and running or I can leave now and come back when you're done acting like a child.""

Bob: ""WHATEVER! JUST GO; YOU'RE USELESS ANYWAY! GET OUT OF HERE I'LL DO IT MYSELF!""

So I left; the executive director had been standing in her doorway around the corner and heard the whole thing. She just looked at me in disbelief that Bob lost it at me like that but later pulled me into her office to make sure I was alright and apologize.

I made it back to IT's section, told my boss exactly what happened (with the DBA listening in). Bob called down to my boss and she cut him off saying she backed my decision and agreed with me. Bob hung up angrily and then called the DBA to complain about me. DBA told him he was a moron and ripped into him about how he was handling everything. I was outside the DBA's office at my desk and heard Bob slam his phone from DBA's receiver. Bob ""took a year off"" after that and then quit before the year was up.

Edit: right, so a number of you have pointed out that I've been working in a Mac-only environment for way too long (last 3 years). Y'all are right that 2011 was Mac's version and I misremembered the version (we've all had those moments or will haha). Must have been 2010 because my boss didn't anything later.

Also, some people have said support was subpar because task manager and powershell should have been used to close the process: i thought (late at night) that I'd explained the issue; the problem was that the pst file size would, for some reason, cause the process to lock and neither task manager not powershell would actually kill the process itself (these were first checks when the users would try to reopen Outlook only to get an endless ""loading"" or whatever the big Outlook-Yellow box said)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT2: Thank you to everyone mentioning losing work for reminding me (it was 6 years ago and.... oh boy do I have other stories)- This particular incident was about 9:30-10 AM?

"In 1998 I was seconded from my job as Oracle DBA to be BASIS (system) administrator for the SAP system that my company was implementing.  To prepare me for my new Role I was sent on all of the relevant SAP courses and a Unix system administrator course.

The company had a Unix 'guru' who had supported some of the systems that had been superseded by SAP.  He helped me while I was bringing myself up to speed with my new responsibilities.

One day the guru sent me a shell script to perform some housekeeping.  It was meant to start in a directory and delete anything in that directory or the subdirectories which was over 30 days old.  Simples.

**The  bad news**


The problem was that the start directory, which existed in the DEV and QA systems, did not exist in the PRD system, which had multiple application servers and used shared filesystems.

The script was unable to find its start point so started from **root** and searched for 'old' files in the whole tree.  The script was being run by the **root** user so had sufficient privilege to delete anything it found.  Perfect storm.

The Unix kernel and the Oracle/SAP executables were all date stamped with their installation dates.  Gone !!

**The good news**

This was when I found out how awesome Unix, Oracle and SAP were.  The kernel and the Oracle/SAP executables were all loaded into RAM on startup and, under normal operating conditions, did not need to be reloaded from disk.  Everything was running in memory, with data being read from and written to datafiles and logs which were in constant use and, consequentially, hadn't been touched by the script.
The other good news was that we had several layers of redundancy in the system.  The application had two central instance nodes.  Both nodes contained the same kernel and full sets of executables.
It took almost a week of long days but we were able to copy all of the deleted files from the standby node to the active node.  Verifying that nothing had been missed was a real nightmare but Oracle/SAP never even blinked and no endusers were aware of how close we had been to disaster.

**Aftermath**

The Unix 'guru' was never allowed to touch our SAP servers again and I learned a valuable lesson for writing future scripts - check which directory you are in before issuing a command !!",My first 'in memory' database,0

"About 8 years ago, I was doing IT Support for a Japanese car manufacturer in the UK.  One day, the computerised phone system broke; it was an external issue, so there was nothing we could do. So we updated the companies intranet page to say don't bother calling, it'll just ring and not connect.  For three glorious hours, not one single call; I cleared out my backlog, dealt with a few emails, and generally had a chilled afternoon.  

Sadly, all good things must come to an end. 

The first call I took went like this. 

Caller *huffing and puffing*: What's going on, I've been trying to get through for the last two hours!  

*Trying to get ahead of his anger and diffuse it*

C: Yeah, well why didn't you update the phone system?!

M: Pardon?

C: You know! Update the phones to say they're not working!

"In my previous posts I talked about working as Tech support for an ISP. But a couple of months ago I got a job at a service desk for government works. Overall much better job. Like waaaay better. But every now and then I still get some interesting calls. 

I talked to a user and informed her that since we had tried everything we could try over the phone, I needed to send an on site technician.   
She asked for her case to be prioritized.   
I informed her that I can't promise that.   
She declared that it *needs* to be prioritized. Because she had called us ""several times"" about this (she had called twice). And here is the kicker. According to her *every time* she calls us, there is always such a long queue. ""It's always have to wait like half an hour just to talk to a human and not some computer"".

Now this sounded all kinds of weird to me. First of all, the only computer message we use is ""Welcome to \[company\] service desk. If you errand is about \[stuff\] Press 1... etc.""  
The second thing that was weird was the waiting time. Let me tell you. One of the reasons I love my new job is that most days we get a 5 - 10 minute wait between calls. We very rarely have even a 2 minute wait for users. In our contract it says that we need to answer all calls within 30 seconds, that is known as an SLA (Service Level Agreement). If the SLA falls below 90% the company pays a hefty fine. If it goes below 80%, the fine gets worse. 

Our SLA for the month of August, is 97,3%. The only queue we had was one day when all the schools started again and every single teacher needed a new password. But that was one day. And the queues were at most 5 minutes. Before that day, since all schools were out (and schools are most of our business), we easily had 20 - 30 minute waits between calls. We had waits so long my coworkers and I brought Switches to play smash against each other between calls. So to claim that ""every time she calls she has to wait"" is just impossible.

I asked the user if she had to wait in a queue for this call.   
She said yes.  
I asked for how long.   
She said easily 5 minutes.  
So I, with a smug smile, informed her when she called I had been next in line for a call for 4 minutes. Out of 16 available agents, 9 were free (I was number 10 until the call came in). So if she had to wait in a queue for this call, she should probably look in to if her phone is broken and has issues connecting calls.  
She started to backpedal and said ""Well maybe not this time. But several other times.""  
Trying not to laugh about the very obvious backpedal and I asked her when she last had an half an hour wait.   
Guess what? She gave me a date that came before the schools started. I pointed that out as well, and informed her of the long wait times between calls. And again I pointed to her phone as the likely culprit.  
She got flustered, pretty clearly annoyed about her lie not working, and just told me to ""send the damn technician"".   
I obliged.

I mean honestly. Why would anyone think a lie like that would work? Doesn't she realize that we, if anyone, are aware of the queue status? We get briefed each week about our SLA. And the numbers are clearly displayed on a white board when we get to the office. I have enough time between two calls to write everything above this paragraph. 

I heard a bunch obvious lies and excuses when I worked for an ISP. But this was the first time someone tried to lie to me about something I don't even need to lookup to see if it was false. I just knew it was complete bull right away. This was just stupid.",When someone blatantly lies to you,0

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background information beforehand:

Back in the 1990s - the dinosaurs here will remember the days, when everything was so much simpler... - I had a nice job with a branch of a big banking / real estate company in Hamburg (Germany), 70km from where I studied at university. Basically, I was required to come in one afternoon a week to take care of any problems the users (all 20 of them) might have encountered in the meantime, check the backup tapes etc. - and most of the time there was really nothing difficult to do. As they didn't do any cash transactions or the ""usual"" banking stuff but only long term investment and real estate deals, transactions were usually not time critical but involved huge numbers (want to guess what successfully marketing 12 whole office floors within the then-new Sony Center at Berlin Potsdamer Platz, real prime location in the German capital, netted the company and the managers involved?)

What made this job special were three advantages I never encountered again anywhere else.

1. The clock started when I left my apartment to travel to work and stopped when I returned there, unless I decided not to go directly and was allowed to put in a hypothetical amount of travel time on the time sheet. They even covered the cost of public transport to and from work... apparently my predecessor had had that deal with them and they never changed it. So, without lifting a single finger doing anything productive, I always earned at least 4hrs wages + travel expenses (again, not for ""business travel"" but just commuting) just by deciding to show up. Nice. But then again, to them it was ""peanuts"". Usually, this worked out to my advantage - I tailored my working days to fit my university lecture schedule, so it was more or less a paid trip to town, work as long as I wanted (or the wallet / bank account needed) and leave in time to enjoy the evening.
2. I got paid a ridiculous amount of money for stupid tasks. Although I did study computer sciences at university at the time and had even gone the extra mile to get my MCSE (Windows NT 4.0 and SQL Server 5.?, long since expired), this didn't have much to do with the day to day work in  a Novell Netware 3.12 / Windows NT 4.0 environment, dealing with everything from printer stoppages, missing paper, stuck tapes and Windows profile setup to scanner issues... I got paid 40 Deutsche Mark / hour, which translated (exchange rate from 1997) to US$27 / hour and, taking 20+ years of inflation into account, maybe double that in today's value. No degree (yet), no formal training, some self-taught skills and plenty of trust in my abilities and honesty...
3. I was, although nerdy / shy, the most popular guy in the local branch. For the secretaries (btw, back then they were picked more for looks than for ability, which made my work both fun and frustrating), I was the only male who was not openly ""superior"" in the company hierarchy and rubbing their noses in it, and I didn't expect them to go to bed with me to ""celebrate"" especially successful business deals. For the sales department, I was the guy who could, with a bit of ""witchcraft"", create fantastic presentation folders and slide shows for their real estate projects. For the legal department, their outlook and mine were closely aligned vis-a-vis data confidentiality and the importance of reliable backups. And the branch manager somehow had the impression they were exploiting me and so he got me to tag along when they went out to celebrate... (blowing just 1% of a RE deal bonus payment on food and liquor can take surprisingly long). During all my time there, I never had to go get my own cup of tea (it always appeared mysteriously at my elbow, white, one sugar, usually accompanied by the secretary with subjectively the most urgent problems) - something the girls flat out refused to do for anybody else - never had trouble accessing any computer even if the really important people in charge were usually reluctant to let anybody interrupt their work, and once even got the branch manager's beamer (a really nice BMW 840 or 850) to take home over the weekend because I had missed the last direct train and he didn't want me to have to wait for a connection...

All in all, people there were strange, friendly, earned ridiculous amounts of money, and usually we got along splendidly. But there are some tales that are too good not to tell...

&amp;#x200B;

The Cast:

* me - obviously me, the part-time IT guy...
* SR - one of our hot shot sales reps, in his 40s - one of the guys who can sell water to a fish and make them feel they got the better end of the deal, unless you got to know him (think used car salesman, but on a huge scale with business deals in the millions), and usually a good guy unless under pressure
* BM - branch manager, with a keen sense of self preservation

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, it's the 90s, so internet, e-mail etc. were rather basic compared to today and vaguely frightening to the older colleagues. It was a Saturday, which is not considered to be a normal working day in Germany, so nearly all shops were closed (back then, retail shops were usually open only before noon on Saturdays, not at all on Sundays).

Enter SR, calling me at home from his mobile phone (btw, hugely expensive back then, like $1,50/minute) to tell me he needed support, pronto, because obviously I had not fixed his problem the week before and he needed to prepare a slideshow for an investors' meeting that very evening. I racked my brain about any unfinished business, but couldn't remember any critical issues or any issues at all related to SR's computer... As I presumed it was more of a layer 8 issue - he was good at selling, but not at dealing with technology - I tried to get more information than just ""my computer won't start"", until finally he admitted he had moved the computer around in his office and as the cable wasn't long enough from the new location he had exchanged the network port for the similar looking telephone port (both RJ45, but one ways hooked up to the data switch and the other one to the telephone system) and vice versa, which nicely explained the conversation we had using his mobile phone, running up a decent bill... and when asked to undo his changes, he flat out refused to do it because he was not (in his words) ""a janitor"", and no, he needed his normal computer to do the work, using another one was absolutely impossible. He had had that situation since the previous Monday but hat worked externally for a few days without telling anybody about his problem - and a problem we don't know about, we can't fix, which would have been really easy.

So he wanted me to come in extra, which was not covered in my contract, and told me he would square it with BM. Knowing SR, his promises are only worth anything as long as he needs you, I insisted on getting authorization from BM who was not amused at all to be called away from whatever he was doing that day to authorize overtime. A short description of the  situation was needed, BM was seething and muttered something about deducting the additional expense from SR's bonus (so it wouldn't cost him or the company a penny) - and since we didn't have anything in the contract, he went full hog and authorized me coming into work by taxi ($200 each way), quadruple overtime (yay!) and, if I needed more than 3 hours to fix the problem, a full meal in the really excellent restaurant next door and, if more than six hours, overnight hotel accommodation nearby. I didn't feel particularly  exploited that day...

Arriving at the office was a bit anti-climactic at first - I expected SR to be frantic because of the approaching deadline, but this genius had finally understood what a ""network"" means, so he had been working on another person's computer all the time, and was nearly done preparing his slides, even apologized for being rude on the phone in the first place. ""Repairing"" his computer took me only a short trip  to the server room to grab a slightly longer cable... but then the problems really began.

Back then, slides were slides, as in physical slides, not powerpoint etc. - and for a presentation, we were able to transfer data directly from the computer to 35mm film using a special (and really expensive) film recorder with a breathtaking resolution of IIRC 640x480. First off, he hadn't announced his intention to create slides to anybody, so the stocks of film were basically empty and (Saturday afternoon in Germany...) he wasn't able to get any from the photo store he usually went to. Being more open-minded, I suggested getting some from one of the kiosks catering to tourists nearby, as they sold film as well... it never occurred to him that you could get it there as well. But... even with film, where would he get that film developed without any businesses being open? The normal ""1 hour rush job photo"" labs were closed...

SR started to get nervous to the point of screaming incoherently at the wall... until it occurred to him that in the red light district (Hamburg's famous Reeperbahn and St. Pauli), there are photo artists who will not trust their photographs to be handled by a commercial lab, so they certainly will develop their own films and might be persuaded somehow to do it for us as well. How he came across that particular bit of knowledge...? We'll never know.

Imagine 20y/o me, the prototypical nerd, a big wad of cash in hand, first of all going to the red light district, which I only knew by reputation and some of those ""look but don't touch"" trips teenagers do with their friends to prove their masculinity (ha ha), asking around for ""photographers"" (apparently the ladies of the night thought I wanted to be photographed in the act and started quoting prices for their services)... finally finding one guy agreeing to develop the film and create the slides... and coming back with receipts stating e.g. ""taxi from &lt;branch location&gt; to &lt;most notorious strip club at the time&gt;"") and ""sex pictures - express service"" - this being Germany, you have to have proper receipts to be reimbursed, and I presume even prostitutes wouldn't bat an eyelid being asked to give a receipt for services rendered. We got ripped off, paying more than 100DM (US$70) for developing that film... but in an emergency...

In the end, we did it, finished everything in time for the presentation and even had a good laugh about it before SR went to do his presentation - no idea whether he sold anything that day. On that one day, I earned more money than in a whole month otherwise, and got to learn a lot about life and the economy as such. A few weeks later, for some reason or other :) , SR and I had some explaining to do to some guy from headquarters about the ""funny"" receipts... took some months, but BM got it cleared up in the end.

That doesn't work after the restart, so I offer to take a look. That computer uses something other than Realtek, but trying to update the driver comes up with an error about the device not working.

Windows 10, am I right fellow computer people?

So anyways, after a google search and forum post leading to the new drivers, the shop owner and employee both come up and ask how everything's coming along. I let them know that it's a restart away and hopefully would be good, likely just a driver issue. The owner shrugs as the employee looks at me and him and says the best thing I've heard in a tech call in a while""

""Well, I wouldn't have guessed that. I don't do audio drivers, I'm a trumpet player""

Had them enter the pin to get into the computer after restart and did a quick test it was back to normal. Quick gig and super simple so I said it's a freebie and gave them my card for future issues they may have. Thanks for taking the time to read, have a good one everybody.","I don't do audio drivers, I'm a trumpet player.",0

"A few years back I was working as a field technician for a company that used to mainly advertise on late night tv. Was expensive as hell but most of the people did not want to lug their PC to a shop and were happy to pay what we charged. This one was unforgettable.

I got a ticket where the guy wanted same day support. Ticket said PC not responsive.

Attended site. Suspected critical windows files and folders must have been deleted. Nothing could be done, startup repair, system restore nothing worked. Only option was to do a fresh install. The guy agreed to it but asked if I could get his apps back. Replied yeah shouldn't be a problem.

While installing windows the guy (who's in his 40's) tells me his library has recently started giving free computer lessons. He always wanted to learn how to use a computer. Bought a second hand laptop and started taking the classes. Tells me of all the various things he's learnt. Pretty basic stuff, e.g. ""we learned how to add a photo on a word document"". 

Windows finished installing. Started asking him all the apps he needed. Had to do a lot of detective work in finding the invoices/serial numbers/activation codes for his Antivirus software and MS Office.

I ask if there's anything else? He says I should install his email as well. Ask if he was using outlook? He points to Google Chrome as what he was using. Ask his email address which is a Gmail account. Tell him he can just log in normally and there is no need to install anything. He wants me to show him.

Open Gmail. Entered his email and ask him to enter the password. He says he can't remember it. I try resetting his password and google wants to sent the password recovery email to his phone as a text or as a link to his recovery email (iirc, not sure what it wanted to text to the linked number. Only remember a phone was linked to it).

Problem is he does not have another email. The phone linked is not his. Ask him what he wants me to do. Tells me he really needs his email. Advise him we are charging by the hour and he says that is fine and he's happy to pay. But I need to get his emails.

I then tried impersonating him to speak with google as he said he wouldn't know what to say. Didn't go anywhere.

He then gives me a password book. Couldn't find anything useful.

Found an option on google where if you give it the exact day the account was made it would potentially give you access to the account. He had no idea when the account was created. 

Ask him who made the account? Tells me does not remember. Some bloke who fixed his computer a few years back. Ask if he still has his number. He gets his diary and gives me a few numbers. I call them 1 by 1 explaining the situation and asking if the email address starting with as**** was theirs as it is set up as a recovery email for the guy I am working for. Finally get a hit on the 3rd guy. He forwards me the password reset email.

I am ecstatic. Finally got somewhere. I reset his password and log on to his email account and my smile turns into a frown. All his emails are missing. I start thinking wtf am I gonna tell him now. Wasted 1 hour for this. The only email I can see is the Welcome to Gmail from 3 years ago.

Ask him if he knows how many emails he had and if he would know why they are missing. 

Tells me that's the only email he's ever had and nothing's missing.",I need my email!,0
"Today I had a disgruntled customer call in regarding a ticket we had escalated up to our level 2 department. Within the day the level 2 technician responded with a well-thought-out response filled with edited screenshots with highlighted points of interest, explanations on several likely causes of the problem, and finally information on who would most likely be able to help them with this issue.

The customer emailed them back with an email two sentences long that more or less said, ""No, that can't be it."" and then waited for all of 18 minutes to call into me and get in touch with the agent in question.

Of course, the agent in question responded at something like 6pm the previous night, so of course, he's a second shifter and is unlikely to be in at 8am. So I did my best to read and explain the issue to the customer, interpreting it to the best of my ability, explaining why their current settings might cause the issue, and who they needed to reach out to.

Granted my understanding wasn't 100%. Especially when it came to explaining why a secondary, third party system might be the cause—sure the input and error are on our system, but the other system is the messenger that carries the input to its destination. In the end, the customer got frustrated with me literally just re-reading the email and trying to walk him through the information he had already dismissed out of hand and demanded I reach out to the level 2 agent so he could speak to him.

I sighed internally and pulled up Slack, found the agent's offline profile, and sent the following private message:

&gt;**Me, in Slack:** Hello Lenny. John Smith called in and wanted to speak to you directly regarding case XXXXXX. He feels like the information provided was unrelated to his issue. The well-thought-out points he raised backed with technical expertise were varied, such as, ""it can't be our settings, this is how it's always been done"" and ""I don't see what the secondary software company has to do with your system errors.""

&gt;I wasn't really able to provide a satisfactory answer aside from trying to re-explain the information you sent because my knowledge on all of this is limited, but at John's request, I agreed to reach out and see if I could get ahold of you. This is that effort so that I can say I did. I apologize. Have a great day.

&gt;**Me, on the phone:** Alright, I've reached out to Lenny and provided him all of the information you provided to me. He'll be in touch with you as soon as he is able. Is there anything else I can help you with?

&gt;**John:** Actually, yes. About this other ticket number XXXXXX. You guys responded but I don't agree with the answer. Why should I have to pay for training in how to use this system? I just have a few basic questions on how to operate it and set it up!

I sighed internally once more and finished off the last of my coffee realizing I was going to be spending another half-hour sitting here re-reading a ticket off to him and convincing him it was the solution before I set in motion the inevitable re-escalation, de-escalation, ticket/phone call cycle I was about to perpetuate that had been going on with this second ticket for two weeks.

Some people just want you to tell them what they want to hear; to hell with due process and technical expertise. It's not the solution *they* want; God forbid they have to lift a god damn finger themselves to correct it.","That can't be the solution, it doesn't involve *you* just fixing it magically",0
"Serving as a humble tier 2 helpdesk monkey is my fate,  
With fun jobs like “upon your website, how do I this resource locate”,  
The ubiquitous “Can you help me, my account to activate”  
And of course the ol’ perennial  “I forgot my password, mate”

The query of this tale is, of that list, the latter  
And begins as all my stories do “Kangaroo here, what’s the matter?”  
“Hi Kangaroo, Joanna here, this is my third helpdesk natter  
My password will not work and my phone I want to batter”

“Worry not, good Joanna”, I start into my spiel  
Let us verify your identity and the answer, good lady we’ll  
be able, working together, eventually to reveal”  
A simple set and forget, an easy case, I feel.

We confirm all of her details just as normal standard and stock,  
Enabling me, while on the phone, her account to unlock,  
I see that her last call to us was around about 4 o’clock,  
And being quarter to five, her speed is quite a shock,

I mean, really lady, it’s not been an hour yet,  
Don’t you think ‘tis a little quick, your password to forget,  
“I’m hope that you can help me tonight Kangaroo, I bet  
I’ve done something dumb, I’ve not met tech that likes me yet”

I straighten up upon my chair and gently adjust my arse  
“Alright, let’s get this straightened out, I’ll now reset your pass  
I see [johannav@chotchkes.com](mailto:johannav@chotchkes.com) is that your email address?”  
“J O H A N N A V at chotchkes? Indeed the answer’s yes.

“Alright I’ve sent an email now” I say and I do see  
Upon my screen her username displayed, johanńav  
“The email has arrived” “Great, then click on our linky,  
to transport yourself to our password reset facility”

“Done” she says “”so my password I type in?”  
“Yes”, say I, that sounds right, that’s where we begin”  
“Then, where it says ‘confirm the pass’ I type it in again?”  
Good idea, do try that, yes indeed that’s quite a plan”

“Done” says she, “and now I hit the register button there?”  
“No, no,” say I, “please hit the one saying ‘Log on’, if you’d care”  
“Nothing seems to happen when I try clicking there”  
“Then could you try...” “I think it’s... oh, it’s loaded now, oh yeah”

“If you could type in, now, your pass and username”  
“my username? johannav?” “yes, one and the same”  
“and password, \*mumbly mumble\* now it’s in” she doth exclaim  
“Invalid ID and pass combo” the site complains.

“Hmm, that’s odd, could you try again” to Johanna, say, I do,  
Says Johanna “try again I have” can this be true?  
“Invalid ID and pass combo” the message doth come through,  
“Oh bother” now what’s the next step we’re meant to move on to?

Right-ho thunk I has this darned lady somehow got it wrong  
“Okay, type in the address bar – initech.com  
and in the top right corner click the button marked log on  
then try again and tell me this  time just how you have gone”

“Invalid ID and pass combo” oh bother, not once more,  
Is this dang person doing just the same thing as before?  
And the username upon my screen again I saw  
johanńav it said, “johannav” I read, “are you sure?”

To keep it brief, I ask you, reader, reread verses 6 to 10  
That’s right, we went back through the whole damn thing again  
And I must tell you, readers, dear ladies and gentlemen,  
I was not entirely surprised what happened then

The same. So miss fat fingers cannot type?  
We’ll have to try a third time with the same old load of tripe,  
But how to make it look different enough without her going in strike  
Aha, thunk I, let’s just make sure we’ve set the password right.

“Dear Lady” did I say “can you once more click that logon?”  
“And this time, hit forgot password, when on that page you’ve gone”  
“My username and email” “yes, dear lady, that’s the one”  
“No matching combination” oh heck, now things just got fun.

So on my own computer to initech.com I go,  
Can I match her stupidity or figure how she wrong did go?  
Logon, forgot password, copy pass and mail, oh no!  
“No matching combination” my tension begins to show.

A strange little dot I try to wipe off of my screen,  
I resist the urge to shout something obscene

How she did that on her phone, I do not rightly know,  
But somehow when she registered, our lovely lady Jo  
Had managed to mistype, upon her phone, her name, oho!

"A temporary (read as permanent) solution placed months ago, was finally fixed today. (I apologize for formatting, on mobile)

A few months ago a wireless access point was moved to a different location in the office and a computer with a wireless NIC started having intermittent connection issues. It was assumed that the connection was too terrible for the fancy (expensive) software this computer was running. 

There is only one network drop in the room so hardline was not an option. The temporary fix was a small 8 port switch and everything continued clicking along. Fast forward a few months, some anomaly caused the switch to deadline.

Today was the day for a permanent solution. While troubleshooting the internet a constant ping to google showed underwhelming results, but while checking all the connections and picking up the mini form factor computer the ping showed a solid connection. Once the computer was placed back on the desk the destination became unresponsive.

Touch the computer, connection is good....stop touching it, no connection.  What could it have been? As many of you can already guess, every external device was then unplugged, remote into the computer, and solid connection. Start plugging everything back in and still solid. Plug in the display, connection lost. Next step, unplug the cable and throw it on the the user’s desk, they are baffled.  None of the specialty cables are available, but a mini display port was also available. One adapter and a new HDMI cable and they are back in business with an actual solution.

TL;DR A bad HDMI cable that still showed a display cause the wireless NIC to have intermittent network issues. Replaced cable, problem solved.",HDMI - the killer of Internet,0
"Edit: Wow! so i went out for a few beverages last night after work n woke up today n this blew up!! This was my first post here on TFTS, so just wanted to drop a thank you to all of you for the upvotes and for my first 3 silvers ever! You guys are awesome!

&amp;#x200B;

So this is actually happening right now.Prologue: I'm a SysAdmin for a small web development company. Bought an employee a refurbished XPS 8930 desktop back in June, and ever since have been fighting memory errors and display issues. My boss finally fed up with listening to me complain says ""it's 2 months old, just warranty the damn thing"". (having done this before) I begrudgingly chat thru dell, explaining the issues to someone who keeps insisting we're troubleshooting a laptop (red flag #1). After convincing her that it is 100% a desktop PC, she determines that the motherboard needs replaced. Naturally this is beyond the skillset of any regular old SysAdmin and needs to be performed by a ""Dell certified technician"". She schedules me an appointment for last Friday, nobody shows (red flag #2). Tuesday a rather grumpy older gentleman in his late 50's shows up to my office with a single stick of RAM (red flag #3). After 2 hours he determines that the motherboard does indeed need to be replaced. So he schedules me another service call for today. And here we are...

Characters - $me and $dct (dell certified techician)

I get a call at 10am from a gentleman who is not the tech that was at my office yesterday to confirm my address. i explain where i am at and he says he's very familiar with the area. Also he wants to troubleshoot the PC over the phone as he has no idea what the initial issue was or what actions were performed the day before (red flag #4) At 1pm I get a call, he's 2 towns over and lost (red flag #5). At 1:45 the gentleman is not only knocking on my office door but also appears to be knocking on heaven's gate if you catch my drift... So i lead him to the computer in question

$dct - what model is this, i've never seen a dell like this before (red flag #6)  
$me - uh... says dell right on the front, it's an XPS  
$dct - well lemme take a look under the hood..... how do i open it? (red flag #7)  
$me - ... um.... (pops panel off)  
$dct - so what did they do yesterday?  
$me - replaced the RAM  
$dct - did that fix the problem?  
$me - (screaming internally) ...i don't think it did...  
$dct - (does some kind of elementary school diagnostics) well looks like i'll have to replace the motherboard.

The extremely elderly mans hands are shaking so bad he can barely hold a screw driver. But i play dumb and kindly get out of his way so he can do the super difficult ""dell certified"" stuff....

So he finishes replacing the motherboard, turns the computer on, runs the dell diagnostics n gets the green check marks on all components. Feeling quite satisfied with himself, boots the PC.

$dct - hmmm... says PXE boot failed, press any button to reboot and try again. I don't know what that means.  
$me - you need to change the boot order (i know he prob will have to reinstall or repair windows, but we havent gotten that far yet)  
$dct - the boot order? i don't know how to do that (red flag #8)  
$me - (my soul hurts) F12  
$dct - (after about 10 attempts and still cant get the boot options menu to show) i don't think it's recognizing the harddrive... I better try to reseat it. (he never touches the cables attached to the HD, instead grabs the 2 lock tabs on the drive tray, pulls the tray out about half an inch and pushes it back in) There, that oughtta do it. (reboots PC, gets PXE error again. lets call that red flags #9 thru infinity). O boy. We might just have to get you a new computer.  
$me - (I'm dying on the inside) How do we just make that happen???  
$dct - well i should call my boss first and see if he has any ideas what to do. I'm not real familiar with this model of PC. Seems really new, like it just came off the line or somethin...  
$me - (my soul is officially dead)

For about an hour, I sat and listened to this very nice older gentleman yelling to his boss on speaker phone, who was trying his absolutely best to get this guy to change the boot order. At one point, they collectively thought maybe the F12 and F2 buttons on the keyboard are both broken, lets swap that out. Surprisingly, this did nothing.

People at work have begun to email and im me asking ""what the hell is going on over in your office?!"" to which i replied ""i actually have no fking idea...""

I've actually been typing this as he's been working... Also googling how to become a dell certified technician, so that i too can someday be better at computer repair. so sorry for the crappy formatting, i'll probably have to go back and fix this.

Finally (after i had blacked out and regained consciousness) we get to booting from the harddrive and windows jumps into automatic repair mode. $dct's boss, who sounds as frustrated as i am at this point, says well it got to windows so now it's my problem which i happily agree too (even tho i know that's crap since the last time i had to have dell come out to service a PC in my office), thus concluding the saga of why dell owes me a case of beer.

TL;DR - Dell Certified Technicians are better at computer repair than SysAdmins... Even tho they don't seem to know very VERY basic computery things....",Dell owes me a beer or 12...,0

**$ttt-** me **$MD-** managing director

**$MD-** approaches my desk: ""ttt my email isn't working - they're not coming from the one I want them to. I can't check if they're sending correctly or not. Can you have a look at it?""

&gt;MD has multiple emails of his set up on his Outlook client, and operating multiple inboxes has previously shown to be a challenge for him. I just thought I'd need to show him how to specify which account he's sending an email from. No big deal.

**$ttt-** ""Yeah no worries. Run me through how you'd usually create and send an email.""

&gt;MD does this all correctly. It turns out he was just relying on the autofill to choose the right recipient every time by starting to type the name and pressing enter. But on top of that:

**$ttt-** ""MD, everything looks fine. You just need to take a second to check when autofilling these recipients. But can I ask one thing... why do you want to CC *yourself* into all your outgoing emails?""

**$MD-** ""Well I want to make sure the emails send ok? That way I get the email myself and file it away after I've checked it sent.""

**$ttt-** ""You do know you can review all your sent emails in the 'Sent Items' folder, right?""

**$MD-** ""But I can never find it so I just need to send myself a copy.""

&gt;Turns out MD was trying to CC himself into the same email he was sending out - each time making the sender a recipient, too. The autofill was filling in his *other* email address (with an identical name) and so he was never getting his 'copy' in the inbox he wanted. After finding, saving to favourites and explaining his 'Sent Items' folder made this checking process redundant, he proceeded to start dragging his sent items in to other random folders.

**$ttt-** ""Uhhh wait MD - instead of stuffing up the history of your 'Sent Items', how about I set up a rule instead? That way you can automatically have a copy sent to your inbox, then either file or delete that copy.""

**$MD-** ""...But how will that work?""

&gt;*Rule applied: send a copy to Inbox of all outgoing mail... categorised in yellow.*

"Cast:

Me: obviously me
CS: customer 
FG: facilities guy
CW: co-worker

Background: I work at a major social media company as a hardware support technician. We usually handle any hardware tickets that come our way, and don’t always interact with users. Some of the tickets we get are monitor tickets, and we have a selection of monitors that we deploy to users. Sometimes, they request for 2 monitors and the most they can have is 1 30” monitor or 2 27” monitors.

One day at work, I received a monitor ticket. The tickets was to swap a 30 inch monitor for 2 27 inch monitors. The 27 inch monitors are newer and less of a hassle to setup, so I get to work on the ticket. Once I complete the setup, I return to my desk and close the ticket. Afterwards, I had to use the restroom, and when I got back, this is what happened.

I saw CS who submitted the ticket speak to one of FG. CS was trying to explain that the ticket he submitted was done incorrectly. FG was trying to explain how the tickets work. FG then saw me and asked me to help him out. I asked what was going on and here’s how the conversation went:

CS: About my ticket, I wanted to keep my 30 inch monitor that I had before and had some other reconfigurations. I never asked to have my monitors swapped.

Me: Are you [CS name]?

CS: Yes. I was wondering why my monitors were swapped?

Me: The ticket stated that you wanted to swap your old monitor to the 27 inch models.

CS: Yes, but I actually wanted to keep my previous setup the way I had it, especially since I’ll be moving desks next week.

Me: I just saw that on the ticket, you wanted the monitors swapped.

CS: Well do you have any other 30 inch monitor that are the same brand as the 27” monitors? I want 2 30 inch monitors.

Me: I’m sorry. Company policy states that a person can either have 1 30 inch monitor or 2 27 inch monitors at most. Also, the 27 inch and 30 inch monitors are both different models.

CS: well, what am I supposed to do? I wanted 2 30 inch monitors swapped for my previous monitor.

At this point, I’m just trying to understand what this guy wants. He kept changing the request from 2 27 inch monitors to 2 30 inch monitors to 1 of each and each time I had to explain the company policy to him. Then, CW arrives and notices what’s going on. He decided to listen on the conversation. At this point, CS gives up and just tells us.

CS: OK fine. I’ll keep the 2 27 inch monitors that were setup and see how I like them. If I don’t, then I’m submitting another ticket.

Me: Alright, sounds good.

CS leaves and we were all relieved. CW explains that it’s not the first time he’s reached out to IT for requests like that one, and that I should be aware for people like that. Apparently, before I joined, CS has been known in our company to submit requests and make the requests really confusing. IT was getting tired of dealing with CS a lot, so I was told if this happens again, then I should report it to CS’s manager.",That’s not the monitor I requested for!,0
"*Disclaimer - Sorry for any bad spelling or mistakes. English isn't my native language and I really didn't write anything in english for a long time.*

So I work for the IT in a local authority. Together with 2 dozen other IT-admins we manage about 2500 clients in 2nd-Level-Support (desktops, notebooks, convertibles and so on). 

Yesterday I had an until then unknown Cause of network problem with one of our PCs I wanted to share with you (tl;dr at the end).

We rolled out this new type of machines in late 2017 and one of this PCs isn't probably working since the very beginning. We set it up just like every other client with our client-management software. It boots up with PXE, installs the windows image and looks to be working fine. We deliver it to our client and the story would be done.

About 1-2 months later we got the information that the network is recurring failing. Since we've got a 5-year-warranty with on-site service we made a ticket, the service replaced the mainboard, tested it and closed the ticket.

Since the mainboard is switched, we have to reinstall the client for a couple of reasons. PXE boots up, installing the image, everything works like a charm, we deliver it to the client again.

A few days later the problem is occurring again. So same procedure, a colleague made a 2nd ticket, but this time the client is working fine when checked by on-site service. 

The PC is sent back to us, we check it and its failing again. So a 3rd ticket is made, the mainboard is switched again  and we get the pc back. Because of internal delays this lasts for months. This time someone stored the PC in our stock, so everyone forgot about it (the affected user got a replacement PC, so everyone is happy).

Now 1 year later i need a PC for an another demand, so I take one from our stock and guess which PC i accidentally took... 

Again, a reinstall works just perfect, everything is fine until i want to do some final configuration by RDP, which isn't working probably because of the again failing NIC. 

I begin to write the ticket, look up the history of this client and see that the mb was switched two times because of this error. I looked up the events entries in Windows, which stated that the NIC isn't reacting to any commands and is about to restart. This occurs 1-9 times everytime the client is booted up and someone logs in. This explains the long times the client doesnt participate in the network. After that it works until the next restart.

So I begin to investigate the real cause, the (**3rd**) mainboard isn't obviosly the reason for this. It doesn't seem to be the software, since its the only client that ever showed with this behavior. 

So I begin to use spare parts to look up which failing hardware causes the NIC to fail. After checking the ""easy-swaps"" without the error going disappearing - like PSU, hard drive and RAM theres only one piece thats about to get tested - the CPU.

After swapping the CPU everything works fine, by installing back the old one the error occurs immediatly again. So we've got a CPU, which causes unknown NIC failures but works perfectly fine until finishing the windows install. I've never heard of this and didn't find anything in the internet. 

I bet if I wrote another ticket without investigation I would now get the 4th mainboard replacement.

**tl;dr** \- Got a client with a failing NIC, the on-site service replaced the mainboard two times and everything worked fine until the complete reinstall. After investigation I note that the CPU is causing the NIC to crash, but operates flawless apart from the NIC.",Client network problem with an suprising Cause,0
"&gt; As the only system administrator for a small programming firm, I usually have to deal with rather stupid requests and issues. We also still use Exchange 2010, and are in the process of migrating since I took over. However, everyone has been a bit hesitant to move, since they don't like the look of Outlook 2016.     

&gt;One morning I walk in and everything is business as usual, but I receive a Gmail notification with the subject line in all caps ""EMAIL ISN'T WORKING!!!!!!"" As I begin walking to my office the VP of sales frantically signals for my attention, and knowing her habits as a user, I grimace and brace myself for her usual ineptitude. She immediately starts yelling at me.   

&gt;VP: ""The email server is down! I just sent you an email to let you know about it. I can't do any of my work without email. This is so frustrating that you guys don't react immediately to this. At my last company, those IT guys knew when the servers went down before anyone else noticed.""     

&gt;Me: ""You sent me an email telling me the email server is down from your company mail account?""    

&gt; VP: ""Yes of course I did, how else could I tell you guys it isn't working? Why don't you take these things seriously?"" she states while rolling her eyes and throwing her hands in the air for added effect. At this point I can feel my frustration in my face and try to compose myself.     

&gt;Me: ""You sent the email to my personal account. I received your email. Are you seeing any errors when sending emails?""   

&gt;  VP: ""JUST FIX THE DAMN EMAIL SERVER!"" At this point I was speaking through clenched teeth, and typed out a quick test email on my company account to send to her.     

&gt;  Me: "" VP, I understand your frustration. But I can't fix a problem that doesn't exist. I just sent you an email on my company account. Did you receive it?""   

&gt;  VP: ""OF COURSE IT WORKS IF YOU SEND IT, YOU'RE THE IT GUY! I'M GOING TO CALL THE CIO ABOUT THIS!""   

&gt;I decided to just saunter over to my office and await the confused and frantic call of my CIO. Instead I receive an email from him stating, ""Don't worry. I know it's working. Just ignore her, she blew a huge deal because she forgot to send an email and wanted to blame it on IT. I checked the mail server and didn't see anything stuck in the outbox. We're all clear.""  As I slowly chuckle to myself, she bursts into my office, which also happens to be the server room.    

&gt; VP: "" You need to set me up with webmail.""     

&gt;Me: ""You're already set up with webmail. Everyone is. I've already sent out several email with instructions on how to access it. You literally replied back to me telling me you refused to use it because you didn't like how it looked.""     

&gt;VP: ""Well I want access again in case the server goes down again and email doesn't work.""     

&gt;Me: ""If the mail server goes down and email doesn't work, webmail won't work. It's the same thing. We're in the process of moving to a hybrid solution to prepare for situations like that, but for right now there's nothing we can do other than troubleshoot the issues that arise.""   

&gt; VP: ""Then why does my Gmail and Yahoo mail work?! You don't know what you're talking about!""     

&gt;  Me: ""We don't have a Gmail or Yahoo mail server. We don't even manage those. That's completely different from our email.""     

&gt;VP: ""I'M GOING TO TELL CIO THAT IT IS UNABLE TO HELP ME!""     

&gt;  After she storms out, I go about my day, letting the soothing white noise of server fans and constant AC relax me. At the end of the day I receive a text from the CIO. It turns out she had sent too many emails to a potential client and had gotten blocked, but chose to delete the error messages she was receiving because she thought it was spam.   

&gt; Unfortunately this was normal behavior, and since she is close to the CEO, I still have to deal with her on occasion.

"A shout out to u/unhappy_computer for sharing earlier, it got me thinking about my issue today.

Background: Only IT guy at my dealership, among other job titles. 

Our finance department still uses dot matrix printers to print the contract and other forms. The system uses an emulator provided by a 3rd party, (cox automotive) to print to them. 

Finance Mgr: ""I am in the middle of a deal and the printer will not work!!

ME: (it had been a long day)"" Have you tried turning it off and on again?""

Finance Mgr: ""I don't know where the power button is, it isn't my job to know, I have customers come fix it!!!""

So I go down there, a husband and wife are sitting in the office and the Finance manager is no where to be found.
Customers said he went to go smoke. 

Awesome customer service right there. 

I get on his computer and pull up the emulator, he has not even logged into it. As I learned the hard way months before, no one is allowed to set their own passwords, I set them. So I log in and proceed to print out a few documents and everything is fine. 

He comes in, "" About time you fixed it!""

I ignore him and speak directly to the customers, ""My apologies for the delay, Mr Finance Manager forgot to login to the system properly. Please do not think of us badly on this.""

I walk out.",My printer isn't working!!!,0
"This story takes place in a mobile phone repair centre in the   time shortly after the client in question was leaving us and taking their business elsewhere. As you'd expect there was a lot of upheaval. Friends and colleagues were being made redundant, temps were being let go of and generally it was not a fun time because of this. 

At the time, I worked in a senior role in 'no fault found' team. We'd deal with the customers where there was a simple enough troubleshooting fix for the complaint, but the clients retail store hadn't been able to fix the issue.

And so it begins... 

**reported fault**
STORE MANAGER ESCALATION!!! CUSTOMERS PHONE STILL HAS POOR BATTERY LIFE EVEN AFTER THE LAST ""REPAIR"". PLEASE JUST DO YOUR JOBS PROPELY THIS TIME AND FIX THE ISSUE LIKE YOU'RE MEANT TO! CUSTOMER VERY UNHAPPY.

I took a look at the notes on the previous job. 

_reported fault of poor battery life verified. Cause of issue is [specific 3rd party app]. Removing app has resolved the issue. Attempted to contact customer, no answer so. Left voicemail advising to not reinstall this app as it will reintroduce the problem._

My blood was boiling. Not only has the store manager accused my team of not doing their job when we did everything correctly, but in fact it was him and his team not doing _their_ job correctly. 

This brings me onto phase one... 

**me:** hi, I'm calling about the phone you've sent for repair. 

**customer:** oh yeah! The one you didn't fix last time! 

**me:** about that... Its this specific app you've installed causing the issue. When you get it back, don't reinstall that and it'll be fine. 

**customer:** Well why didn't you tell me this last time instead of wasting my time? 

**me:** we tried to call but didn't get through so left a message, however the store have all the relevant troubleshooting guides to have fixed this within a few minutes of you walking into the shop, so really they could've sorted this in 5 minutes without you needing to send it off to us at all. We also left them some notes on the last job explaining what I've just told you. Did they go through any of that with you? 

**customer:** no, they just booked it in straight away both times. 

The customer did a complete 180 from being mad at my team to being furious at the store, and I'd made it clear that the store had all the resources there to sort this issue out, but for whatever reason, hadn't. The customer was very keen to discuss this in person with the store manager... 

Phase one complete, onto phase two. 

**me:** hi, I'm calling from your repair centre. Can I please speak to the store manager in relation to this job? 

**store manager:** ahh yeah, you guys didn't fix this customers problem the first time round so its back with you again. The customer is NOT happy. Have you got it working again now? 

**me:** I'm actually calling with regard to your notes claiming that we need to do our jobs properly. 

**store manager:** Well, yeah... It was still faulty after you sent it back. 

**me:** No. The customer reinstalled an app that we identified first time round to be causing the problem. _You_ didn't follow the troubleshooting guide on this, and the previous repair. You could've fixed this issue yourselves. You also didn't read my teams notes from the last repair which again could've resolved this customers issue. 

**store manager:** ahh right OK. Well hopefully the customer will be alrig-

**me:** and I'd just like to point out, as you're aware, you're repair work is going else where, however despite this we're still providing you with fantastic service. What you're accusing us of in you're notes is incorrect and offensive to the technicians who've worked on your repairs with the same effort as always despite the threat of redundancies hanging over them. Everyone here has done their jobs correctly and the phone is on its way back. When it's returned, please do your job properly this time, OK?

**store manager:** Well, er... Yeah ok, sorry about that. Just this customer was really mad. Hopefully he'll be OK when he comes to collect the phone and I'll tell him what he needs to do. 

**me:** don't worry, I've already told him what to do. He mentioned he has a few questions for you when he comes to collect the phone...",Just do your job properly and fix it like you're meant to.,0

"Long time ago, somewhere in the 1990's I was the the guy in the family who you would call if you had any problem with your computer (I'm still now-a-days). Building my own computers, having a job at a helpdesk next to my studie. You get the point, the family-nerd.

In those days, my father called me because he had to install a program and wasn't sure how to do it. So on the phone (I was living about 600 kilometers away from home in the city of my university), guiding him through the process. Get the plastic off, insert disk 1, ""yes the disk with 1 at it and the written side up. Type cd a:, type install, now wait. Yes it is supposed to do the noise"". System asks for disk 2? Insert disk 2 and press enter. Going pretty wel so far. System ask for disk 3? Well, insert disk 3 and 4.

What do you mean, you can't insert disk 4? It won't fit??? The my father told, the second and third disk were already very hard to get in. Excuse me??? Then I got an idea. Asked him ""did you take out disk one before you you entered disk 2?"". The famous answer was ""No, you didn't say I should, you only said to put in disk 2 (and 3 and 4).""

Yes, it was in the time of the 5,25""-single-side disks. He managed to get 3 floppies in it. He was so nice to put the pc in his car and drove to my place (instead of letting me on a 2x all-day-train-trip on a weekend to fix it). Took me a few hours to get the disks out unharmed. I also installed the program for him as he was in my place.

"A long time ago in a land far, far away, your humble narrator served the University as supervisor of the Tier 1 HelpDesk. From my tiny office crammed with myself and as many as three student employees we answered the call to action from confused and anxious students, faculty, staff, and guests who were experiencing problems with technology on site.

Background:  
There was a specific phone line called the ""Need Line"" or the Red Phone which was our classroom emergency line. Professors called it when there were students in the seats and ~~whatever technological wonder they had planned~~ their PowerPoint wasn't working. Calling it would ensure an immediate escalation to tier 2 techs to ~~ride to the rescue~~ respond to solve the issue.

What Went Down:  
The Red Phone rings and $SE answers the phone. I listen to her interacting w/ $AP (a professor who has a reputation for being a jackass to IT already). She gathers the pertinent details and repeats them back to $AP to make sure we are correct. $AP finds this clarification needless and says ""DID I STUTTER?"" in such a way that is clearly audible to those of us in the room. $SE looks like she has just been physically slapped in the face, but explains the clarification is necessary to make sure our techs respond to the right situation. $AP hangs up and the situation is escalated properly. $AP's reputation with the HelpDesk degrades to the point where any future tickets at normal priority are assigned the max 48 hour appointment even if there is something earlier.

"This is from about five years ago, so forgive me if some of the events are a little out of order. I used to work as a tv/ appliance repair man for a furniture/ electronics/ appliances chain of stores, my day would start with me working on the computers and sound systems at the store then I would drive out to people’s houses to work on their televisions and appliances, I had a work truck and a portable printer, so I was able to do my own thing. 

One day, while I was checking on parts that I ordered, the store manager (who is not my boss, but sometimes you have to go along to get along) came up to me and asked if I could add one more stop to my drive, he sold someone a tv and the screen would only display black and white, so I asked him for the address and went ahead, I was going to make that my last stop for the day since it was on my way home.

I get to the house and who I guess was the owner let me inside, upon walking in, there were four people just staring at me like at any moment, I would yell “POLICE!!” I shrugged this off and asked where the tv is. The owner never turned a single light on in the house, just took me to the tv that was sitting in the dark, the only light was the black and white screen displaying a scooby doo cartoon.

I’m not going to include why all of the lights were off but I’m sure you can use your imaginations, I learned this when I pulled my mini lantern out of my work bag and that’s when I see the problem, within five seconds, their tv is in color again.

The owner thanked me and asked what I did, I told him that it was technical, trying to help him save face, but I’m stared at by everyone yet again, so I had to tell the truth, I PUT THE YELLOW CORD IN THE YELLOW HOLE!!!
I expected some embarrassment but no one there was ashamed at all, so I packed up and made a call to the store manager and I let him know what happened, he made a deep sigh and thanked me.

"I work as tech support for a company that sells access control, alarm and video surveillance products. I'm on the phone all day, helping installers with any technical issue they could have with our products.




I get a call from a technician that is his own boss, he's kind of a one man show. He has no employee and mostly does small business or residential camera system installations, so when he calls, it's never a real, unsolvable issue. He installs lower end cameras and DVRs that are pretty much plug and play.



So he calls me, and he's at his customer's location, which is a small family owned business. His customer is right next to him. The problem is that ""His camera system is not recording at night"".



Okay, I get calls like this every day. I'm 99% sure the problem is that he didn't set the schedule correctly.



So I walk him through the menus, and he slowly makes his way to the Storage Schedule section. After having him tell me what he sees on the screen, we determined that the recording schedule for his storage is not the problem. There is another section in the menu where you can enable motion detection to work only at certain time, so I help him navigate to that section, but it was set for 24/7. 




So the issue wasn't in the DVR menu. At this point I'm thinking that he went into each individual camera's setting, and it's the camera themselves that doesn't have the right schedule. We can't browse the web interface of the camera when it's on the DVR, unless you have a laptop and some ipv4 knowledge.



So I have the technician grab his laptop in his truck and I walk him through setting up his network card to the right IP. After about 30 minutes of back and forth, he finally gets to one of the camera's web interface, only to realize that the schedule was left by default, with the right settings. So that wasn't the issue either.




At this point all my ideas were shot down. The technician kept on saying that the issue was with the product, but I knew it was almost impossible.



I had a look at the time the videos would stop and start recording. It was never at the same time. Sometimes it would start at 6:30 am and stop at 9:20PM, sometimes it was 7 AM to 8PM. 




So the technician puts his customer on the phone. I ask him about what he does when he gets in the morning, what times does he leaves at night, and what he does before leaving.



It turns out, the first thing the guy does when he gets to work in the morning is flick the light switch on and turn on his PC. Then when he goes home at night, he turns off the light before walking out of the building. I ask him to turn off the light right now. He does, and the DVR immediately shuts down. His DVR was plugged in on the same outlet as the lights, so it's only working when the lights are on.




Needless to say, the technician was super embarassed. We were on the phone for about 50 minutes before we realize what's going on.

I guess the moral of this story is that you can't assume that anything is properly installed, you and should start the troubleshooting process to the very basics, even if it seems stupid obvious.","""My camera system doesn't work during the night""",0
"I worked as a project manager for an engineering company for about 10 years or so. This is about one project where we built 10 custom control panels for a customer a month of basically 2 very similar design. The difference was whether it had a single or dual gauge pressure controls installed. One month they order the 10 of the single design and our shop accidentally laid out and built the dual design by mistake.  They refuse the order and we shelve all the cases and back panels that were drilled for the extra gauge and regulators. This was not a good thing, but not the end of the world either. 

They haunted my shop foreman as he could see them on the shelf every day while he worked. Many months later we get a rush order for 10 of the single units. Unfortunately, these units were spec'd for Allen Bradley enclosures and at that time there were none to be had anywhere in the country. Customer is screaming they need these units ASAP!! I tell my shop guy to get the cases down and to put hole covers in the extra holes for the pressure regulator, layout and use the dual design on the back panels for the gauges. 

Now I call the customer and explain that I have made an engineering change for our finished product. It now comes in a dual control ready enclosure only. This will reduce the number of variants, inventory, and UL certification issues that we have to deal with. Now if they need to upgrade a panel from single to dual in the field it is a breeze. Add the gauge, the pressure controls a couple of terminal blocks and there you go! ""Bob's your uncle!"", as some say. I showed my boss the plan I had hatched and he laughed at me. Brilliant! So, you are telling me we can fill the order right away with parts on hand that they refused months ago? That is correct, sir. Just wanted to run it by you before I hit the customer with our new ""Streamlined manufacturing process"". The customer was all for it, thought it would be great for simplifying production and inventory management, also realized this was a real selling point for their salespeople as well!

Best of all, I got to get rid of those panels staring down on us for so many months!! No bonus, no raise, but I did receive the gratitude of a certain shop guy..... Thanks, TB.","Not a flaw anymore, it's now a FEATURE!",0

Now, me being bright thought ""fuck it, I'll get more done by running the whole sheets through"" thinking the office lady that told me to do it manually was an idiot (I was 17, anyone I didn't agree with was an idiot)

Anyway, I read the shredder ""up to 8 sheets at a time"" it says on the front.

So I line up 8 boxes.

I take the top sheet off every one and make it into a neatly stacked ribbon.

I feed it into the shredder and admire my work.

I'm getting 8 boxes done in the time it used to take me to do 1, half that.

I'm going across the road for a coffee.

Yeah, on my way back, coffee and ham, cheese, tomato croissant in hand, I see the fire alarm going off, people evacuating, and the fire brigade screaming up and running inside.

I locate the IT Department and we all have a chuckle, and go down to get coffees, we'll, me to drink mine and them to get some.

Midway through coffee my boss gets a call, I hear the ""Really?"" and ""You sure?"" and ""That doesn't sound right"" and ""OK, I'll tell him""

So he puts down the phone and explains to me that while yes, my idea was great, and he sees exactly where I was coming from, the shredder was never designed for continuous operation eating ribbons of paper.

The duty cycle on the shredder was a whopping 45 seconds we found out when the Gilbarco guy came out, we estimated the shredder actually lasted 15 minutes.

Props though, I was off the hook as when they pulled the shredder apart they found that it had a thermal overload to prevent this and that had failed. So really, the printer should have turned off before catching fire.

I still had to clean it all out and throw all the burned stuff in the bin.",I set fire to the shredder,0
"A client of my company had sent in a ticket complaining about one of their DECT phones shutting down when taken off the charging station for only a few minutes. This is usually a result of old chargeable batteries that just won't charge properly after a couple of months/years depending on the quality.

We let them know that we suspected this was the problem and that we would order some of those batteries for them. The order would arrive next day and we had time to drive it out to them the day after that. The receptionist thanked us for this trivial service as she had no idea what kind of batteries the phone needed (chargeable AAA).

The manager didn't agree though. But didn't let us know any of it.

2 days took way too long apparently. If he had decided to get some batteries himself that would fit and be chargeable there wouldn't even be any harm done. We needed new stock anyway.
But instead of listening to us and checking the batteries, he'd decided he'd just buy a new set of phones with base station and everything. Keep in mind that this was for one out of three phones not working properly.

Here's the kicker. They used VoIP, he bought a landline compatible DECT set (with only an rj11 socket).

Meanwhile we hadn't heard anything after we'd spoken to the receptionist. So when the manager called us why his new phones wouldn't work we didn't really know how to respond. When we got there with the new batteries we saw what he'd done and for the life of him he couldn't understand how these new phones wouldn't work. He managed to get power to the base station without any other cable plugged in so the handsets got a signal from it but the line was dead of course. 

After putting in the replacement batteries the problematic handset worked fine and we switched everything back to how it used to be.
I dont think you can get a refund on entirely unpacked hardware so that was tough for the manager.

Communication wasn't his strong suit. I'll post another story later about him and his printer.

Edit: [Here's the link to the other story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cuw6yy/the_fuser_that_fused/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)","""We just thought we'd some new phones...""",0
"This is the story of the printer in a small dental practise that I described in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cusicj/we_just_thought_wed_some_new_phones/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) with a manager who doesn't really listen.
I'm part of a small tech support company which supports all types of businesses.

This practice naturally had a waiting area with a receptionist desk. Behind it were two PC's which had the dental software and a printer. The area behind the counter was rather small as in you had to scoot behind whoever was manning the desk by pressing yourself against the wall behind it. The printer itself was placed ontop of a small stool past the two receptionist against the far wall from where you entered.

One fateful day the receptionist calls us because of a paper jam. They explained they tried to get it out, but only managed to rip off a few pieces. They are afraid to do anything else to prevent further damage which I give them credit for. Not that it mattered but you'll know why later.

I make an appointment to come check it out asap as they need to be able to print and dont have another option. On my way I go with some basic tools and cleaning stuffs to prevent any further jams.

When I get there and set up my tools in the cramped area I can see little bits of torn paper sticking out from where the paper usually comes out when printed. Usually you can solve such a jam by opening up some side panels, but there appears to be nothing there. Where is the paper stuck then?

I soon come to the conclusion that I can't service this printer any further from that cramped location with the tools I had and ask if I can take the printer with me to the office for further inspection and maybe additional help. Receptionist is ok with it but in walks the manager.

""You can't take that printer with you, I need to be able to print my forms.""

But... You can't print anyway...

Going back and forth a bit and he finally agrees if I set up an old canon printer he had in storage or somewhere.
I do the needful.

When I take the printer back and pry it open I finally found how it was jammed. The fuser apparently got dirty due to cheap refilled ink/toner cartridges that leaked too much ink/toner to handle. (The fuser fuses the ink or toner to the paper using heat)

We warned the practice the last time we had to clean it and we advised to get better quality so we don't have to come back for it another month as using refills is pretty much playing Russian roulette. Get a cartridge that's only refilled once you're in luck, get one refilled 6 times you're going to have trouble. Also your warranty is void when using these cartridges.

Anyways, due to too much ink the paper sheets got stuck to the fuser roller one after another and after sheet 3 the printer ate the paper. Explains why I couldn't get to it through the side panels.

We contact a hardware partner to see what we can do and they advise we just get a new printer because the fuser costs more than the printer (I know, doesn't make sense but it's true).
We contact the manager and explain how and why and why there's no warranty. He isn't happy of course but knows we can't help it any further. We let him know we can order a new one for him and it will be there in 2 days. Sound familiar? (Reference previous post)

That's the last time we heard anything from him untill about a week later. We need to setup his new printer because he can't...

Why do you have a contract with us if you don't use it? We could've gotten it done in 2 days including setup...",The fuser that fused,0
"A customer had came into chat/IM-style connection and was confused where all her emails were hiding. Confused by her unclear typing, I did my due diligence and got connected to her computer with her permission to do so. Looking into it revealed she just had one email from July, and I decided to send her a test one as well from my email. After verifying the email worked, she was still confused where the rest of her emails were at.

As one would expect, I verified whether she has multiple emails to choose from (\[*c-email1**...*\], \[*c-email2**...*\]) which it turns out she does, and has two gmail accounts! So, of course, I advised that she would need to log into \[*c-email2*\] to see the emails she's expecting to see since she's currently logged into \[*c-email1*\]*.*

Notes from a previous case indicated that she didn't know the password for \[*c-email2*\] and trying to reset the password was unsuccessful (or as unsuccessful as ""We'll review and reach back out in 3-5 days."" can be). Regardless of that though, we did the same thing again today, to the same end result. She decides she doesn't need further support, ends the session, and I go about my merry way.

An hour later I get an email from her, as a response to my original test message. It says:

To: \[*myEmail*\]  
From: \[*c-email1*\]  
""MY E-MAILS SEEM TO BE COMING IN, THANK YOU  FROM: \[*c-email2\]""*

"Way back in the day, when Compaq 286s and Mac SE 30s were top-of-the-line machines, I was the sole IT person in the company.  Man, that's almost 30 years now.  Time flies.  Dialog is obviously paraphrased from what was actually said.

We had two computer rooms, one for PCs and one for Macs.  The consultants in the company would generally use the PCs to crunch their numbers (Lotus 1-2-3 for DOS if you can believe it) and the Macs to do word processing (good old MS Word 5.1 for Mac) and business slides (MacDraw) for presentations.

Most of the Macs were 512K Macs with dual floppy drives, but we had just acquired an SE30 with a whopping 20 MB hard drive.  This baby was smoking fast, and was the preferred machine to work on for most.

One day, I get paged to the Mac room.  I walk in and Bob is sitting there, looking fairly worried.

""This error message is telling me that my file is corrupted.  You need to recover it; it's vital for a presentation tomorrow!""

""Okay, I'll try my best.  Let me sit there and take a look.""

Now, Bob was known for being a bit of a contrarian.  If you told him to do something, he'd find a way to not comply.  So instead of getting up and letting me sit in the chair in front of the SE 30, he reached over, put his hand on the side of the SE 30 and slid it over to where I was standing next to him.

If you aren't familiar with SE 30s (or any of the original all-in-one Mac bodies), they are fairly light and top heavy machines.  While he didn't tip the SE 30 over, its narrow footprint and rubber ""feet"" made it very prone to ""chattering"" when being slid.

And that's exactly what it did while I was shouting, ""No, don't!"", lunging forward to stop him.

Too late.  Instant sad Mac icon on the screen.

""Well, you may have to postpone tomorrow's presentation.""

""Why?  What happened?""

""You toasted the hard drive.""

""What?""

""That chattering or bumping when you slid it caused the read/write heads to literally crash into the hard drive platters and physically destroyed the hard drive.""

""No way.  Well, you have to fix it and recover the data.""

""Not happening here.  You'd need a clean-room and lots of time and money.""

""Find out how much and let me know how much.  The client will pay for it.""

So, I went and spent about 2 hours investigating if there were any firms in the Boston area that would do this kind of HD recovery.  There was one (still in business today!) and they were not cheap.  If I recall, they quoted me a low 5-figure number and even then couldn't guarantee success.  They said that it was usually government agencies that needed such measures taken.

I relayed the price figure to Bob and he flipped out.  He couldn't believe it would be that expensive, and started making noise about me making up the price, and generally hinting that he would try to get me in trouble for not just doing what he was demanding.  I think he even offered to negotiate the price with the data recovery firm.

""Okay, Bob.  Let's go ask Dave.""

Luckily for me, Dave, the president of the company (my boss) was quite tech savvy, and he shut down Bob's harangue pretty quickly.

He finally asked Bob what had been lost.

""About 15 pages of a presentation.""

""Had you ever printed it out?""

""...""

""Bob?""

""Yes, I have a printout from yesterday, but I had made a lot of edits.""

""Well, do them again.  I'm not paying $10,000 for you to not have to redo edits you just made yesterday.""",Why sliding computers is a bad idea,0
"I’m gonna go ahead and write this one while it’s fresh….

&amp;#x200B;

CB = Me, Codebooker, Private Tech Guy Who Does IT Work

RE = Sam (not her real name), the Restaurant Employee, a 30-something-year-old woman who has worked at this restaurant for many years

RO = Bill (not his real name), the Restaurant’s Owner, a 40-something-year-old dude who has been running this place for many years

Backstory: Earlier this week I upgraded this client from one POS terminal to two POS terminals so that the restaurant will be ready for the inevitable influx of customers that’ll come Labor day weekend. The upgrade went fine, I only had to take their POS system out of service for one business hour while the software was upgraded, then they were able to use the main terminal again while I finalized the config on the second POS terminal. I managed to get everything rolling and both terminals fully functional, and everyone was happy with it. Picking up this evening, about an hour ago, which is months after the timeframe in which my last tales from tech support post referring to this client took place. Same restaurant employee as last time, except this time, she’s been drinking (however I didn’t know this until I arrived on-site)… So she's even less tech-savvy than her normal level of tech-savviness which is rather low. This wonderful situation started with a text message from the RO…

&amp;#x200B;

RO: “U up?”

CB: (stupidly answering my phone this late at night) “Yeah, what’s wrong?”

RO: “Computers locked up”

CB: “Both?”

RO: “Yes, and they won’t reboot”

RO: “Main register locked up good and now the bartender said she can’t access tabs on the second register”

(The main register feeds the secondary register via an SMB share on a secure network, so if the main one screws up, the second one won’t work either)

RO: “She said it won’t let her do anything so I told her to pull the plug from the wall, then wait five minutes and plug it back in”

(At this point I’m internally thinking, “Shit!… That’s not good… That could cause other issues...”)

CB: “Unplugging a running computer is never a good idea, ever. To force a computer off safely you’re supposed to hold the power button for 5 – 10 seconds, but you should have called me before telling the bartender to do anything”

(I think he was trying to avoid paying an after-hours charge for me coming out)

CB: “I’m on my way”

&amp;#x200B;

So I get there and it was RE again, except this time she’s a bit on the drunk side, I found out from a dude at the bar that she’d been drinking lemon drop shots with one of her friends when that friend came in earlier. So, she was useless as a witness to the problem, other than to tell me that “it doesn’t work, it won't turn on”.

I plugged everything in and hit the power button and what do you know, the power button turned the thing on… It came up just like it was supposed to. I logged in to the POS software, then went and restarted the software on the second terminal and then logged in there too. The restaurant was back up and running. I checked the error log on the software and on Windows Event Viewer and found nothing irregular, so I suspect it was operator error rather than a software problem. I told her to get up with me if the ‘problem’ happens again. I also informed RO that his bartender was inebriated on the job and this was a potential cause of the 'problem', but if there is an issue again ""please call me before telling the bartender to force off a running computer"".

tl;dr Drunk Bartender + POS Terminals = “It doesn’t work! It won't turn on!”","The Ballad of Sam, Part 2... ""It doesn't work, it won't turn on""",0
"This is a disclaimer at the top of my VPN setup instruction page. In bold. In full, it reads:

&gt;**Please read and understand THE ENTIRE INSTRUCTION LIST at least once before attempting to follow it. It will save you a lot of headache instead of following it blindly!**

We run Mac and Linux, so I have instructions for both, but there are shared instructions for the core parts - namely, generating a certificate pair on the intended machine and sending the CSR to me.

A remote user who lives in another country visited for our summer party. He'd previously asked for VPN access to share screens with his colleagues. No problem, management approved, here's the link to the instructions. This person has a Ph. D. in computer science and is an extremely intelligent AI researcher. So naturally, they have no clue how to do simple tasks.

Via Slack:

&gt;$user: hey $me, I followed the instructions and OpenVPN is telling me the config is invalid.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: er, which instructions are you following? There are several steps preceding that which involve you talking to me first.  
&gt;  
&gt;$user: I renamed the OpenSSL config file to .ovpn

Head, meet desk. Have a conversation.

Respecting SSL best practises, I ask the users to generate the certificate pair because then the private key never leaves their machine. The instructions are (essentially):

1. Download this barebones OpenSSL config file (pre-filling most of the required values).
2. Using the config file, copy and paste this OpenSSL command, replacing $HOSTNAME with your computer's asset tag.
3. Find the .csr file and send it to me to sign.
4. I'll send you back a zip containing the config and all the necessary files (except your private key).
5. You add the private key and import the config file.

&gt;$me: so you didn't read the instructions?  
&gt;  
&gt;$user: I did nothing but read the instructions.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: and yet you still did it wrong. &lt;copy and paste the big bold disclaimer&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$user: Having read the instructions, I remember that line!  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: apparently it's the only line you did. read Steps 2 &amp; 3 again.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: i also notice that you didn't ping me about the prerequisite step?

The prerequisite step involves setting up an LDAP account; $user has been with the company longer than I have, before I built the domain. Ergo, his laptop has a local account, while my VPN has LDAP auth. The prerequisite instructions, which detail how to change his password from the default (asking me for the default) are highlighted multiple times.

&gt;$user: I didn't even get there yet. I thought using the OpenSSL with the GUI that asked for an OpenSSL config was part of 'getting' OpenVPN.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: ...  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: &lt;copy and paste the big bold disclaimer a second time&gt;

Fortunately after the second prompting, he did go back and read the instruction list in full, and sent me the correct .csr. Everything went smoothly after that.

I'm going to change the disclaimer slightly. **It will save $me a lot of headache!**

And perhaps add a second disclaimer:

&gt;If you do not read these instructions and do it wrong, I reserve the right to quote your chat transcripts at length on social media to highlight your mistakes.",*Please read THE ENTIRE INSTRUCTION LIST before attempting to follow it*,0

"I’m a college student and have been working at my university library’s tech support for a few years. We service all of the staff members in the whole library, most of which are very sweet librarians and the rest are awful human beings. 

In comes Staff Member (SM), a middle aged woman whom I haven’t dealt with too often. SM’s printer keeps jamming so I bring it to the IT bench to inspect, searching for scraps of paper or any damage. I then get on Dell support for 1.5 hours and they determine it needs replacement rollers, so I tell SM that it will take 24 hours for them to send the rollers and for me to reinstall her printer. The next day (Friday) the replacement rollers don’t fix the issue, so Dell sends a brand new printer that will arrive on Monday. I tell SM that I will setup her new printer once we receive it. 

On Monday, I plug in the new printer and test it and there’s some new issues. My coworker and I spent over an hour trying to work on it, failed to realize that I needed to move over the imaging drums from the previous printer. So at the end of my shift I apologize to SM and tell her we needed to work on it more tomorrow and I’ll bring it down first thing. 

So on Tuesday, I bring down her new printer. It’s not networked so it connects directly to her PC. Well, when I connect it guess what happens? PC doesn’t recognize it, so I tell her I need to play around with some settings. After 10 mins nothing is working so I tell her I’m going to consult my supervisor about what to do and I’ll come down as soon as I have a solution. 

It’s worth noting that SM wasn’t supposed to have a personal printer to begin with. She recently moved offices and the new one happened to have a printer in it so she’s been using this only for the past couple of months, meanwhile there is a shared network printer literally 5 feet from her office that everyone else in the area uses and she has access to. 

Anyway, I go back upstairs and google what to do (like all good IT techs) and my coworker comes in, he says “uhh, I was just downstairs helping [person] and I overhear SM going ballistic. She says ‘I am so sick of this IT department. They hire the most incompetent students possible. I don’t understand why it’s taken her 3 days to fix this f*cking printer. How hard can it possibly be?! I don’t even think she got me an actual new printer. And of course she had to ask [supervisor] for help because SHE DOESNT KNOW SHIT ABOUT PRINTERS!!! She’s too dumb to figure it out herself!’”

At this point I’m speechless. Not only did I get her a brand new printer when I didn’t have to, but I have been nothing but kind and apologetic to her. Yes, it wasn’t a quick fix. But guess what?! NOT MY FAULT. We all know tech has a mind of its own and sometimes things just don’t work out. 

So I’m incredibly pissed off but I found a solution to the issue (thank god for IT forums) and I go downstairs and install the printer correctly, test print, everything is fine. I say “I’m so sorry this has taken so long, everything that could’ve gone wrong did but it’s all working now!” She says “oh my, no apologies necessary at all. I know none of this is your fault. I really appreciate it.” Fake b*tch but anyway, I’m about to leave and her internet shuts off. Just completely stops working. I run the troubleshooter, try everything under my belt. I apologize again, tell her I’ll grab her a new network cable and see if that helps. She says “I know you’ll figure it out sooner or later” ugh. 

Luckily my coworker dealt with this exact issue before and knew what to do, so I fix it and again apologize cause it’s taken time away from her work. She says “seriously don’t worry about it, the world isn’t ending because my f*cking internet shut off. You’re fine.” 

So that was the end to my painful encounter with this woman. I cannot possibly believe why someone would have so much hatred towards a student worker making $13/hour, and I literally catered to her by myself, spent over 2 hours on Dell support chat, was incredibly nice to her the entire process.

"I used to work for an animation company with around 450 employees.  Productions usually included anywhere from 50-100 artists, producers, directors etc all in the same area, and the workstations were set up on fold-able boardroom tables, with 4 workstations per table.

We got a call one morning that one of the tables had mysteriously lost power, and they couldn't get any of the workstations running.  So, I head over with another tech to investigate, and when we arrive, there is a smell of burnt plastic in the air.  We both look at each other, and instantly dive under the table to see what was on fire.He was checking the PSUs on the workstations, while I focused on the surge protectors.  What I saw next has perplexed me to this day.

Apparently, some of the artists had brought in little space heaters and were running them off of the surge protectors we had earmarked for the workstations.  This had overloaded the circuit, and caused the GFI to trip.  So, they popped the switch, and carried on until it happened again.  At which point, one of the TAPED THE SWITCH DOWN ""because how am I supposed to work if it keeps switching off??""

[Here is that surge protector, and also the very first pic I posted to Reddit](https://imgur.com/eo7rkEd)",What's that smell?,0
"So I work for a company that offers GPS/Logging solutions for commercial trucks. I work for the lowest, frontline tier of technical support, so we're basically the frontline. The technology we use is almost exclusively built and programmed in-house so we're constantly running into all sorts of weird issues that we only see once and we have nothing but hearsay and Slack to figure out what the hell arcane ritual the only other guy to get this issue used to fix it last time.

This was not one of those issues. It was one of the most basic goddamn issues that any computer trying to securely exchange data could have.

So I get an email from an administrator within a company wondering why the hell their Driver has working logs on their end but none of the logs are coming through and displaying on the admin's end. I see this and I know, ""Thank god, an easy one. It's probably a certificate issue. So either we need to fix the time on his display or have him log in and log out to have the driver's login re-authenticate back up with the main system.""

So I tell them, in more professional terms, that the driver's display probably has the wrong time on it. Have the driver call in and we can probably walk them through sorting out the issue pretty quick.

Apparently, this was not enough for the administrator on the other end. They took one look at my email, sent a long, ranting email over my head to their assigned customer manager about how incompetent I was and how this was clearly a communications issue with our servers and we needed to fix it.

The CM forwarded me the scathing email and tacked on their own message, ""Hello, please work as needed to provide a better explanation of this and how we can fix it.  Back office needs to be able to see logs on their end.""

So I put on my biggest rage-induced smile and started typing up a second email to the admin. I'm not exactly versed in the exact terminology and technology in how certificates work, but I assume, basically, they're just there as a way for two distant systems to securely handshake, verify they are who they say they are, and trade information.

So I typed up the most saccharine-sweet, detailed, and condescending email that opened with ""per my previous email"" on the workings of certificates(as much as I know), why they were important to information security, and slowly broke it down to why something as small as the time on the display might throw this off(as far as I could guess). I also included the three or four other less likely causes for the issue and broke down the why behind that and how those issues also would need to be fixed directly on the display.

I wrapped it up with, ""So per my previous email, it is most likely an issue with the time on the driver's display. Please have someone such as the driver or a technician with the display in front of them call in to troubleshoot the issue with us."" More or less ending with what I said last time.

It was satisfying to write from beginning to end, was dripping with condescension, and the best part is that it could also easily be interpreted as me just trying to be as helpful as possible as requested. I don't know about you guys, but about the only thing that makes my calm demeanor crack is when someone who knows absolutely nothing about how the technology works decides that I, who work with it for a living every day, somehow am incompetent and have no idea what I'm talking about.

I mean, yeah, okay, I'm not a goddamn software or network engineer here. But at the basest level, I know which hammer works best when slammed against the various nails jutting out.

**tl;dr:** Just me blowing off some steam about a customer who didn't think I knew what I was talking about, so they went over my head, the people over my head asked me to explain better, and I sent a ~~condescending~~ helpful email explaining in excruciating detail basically what I said last time.",Hammers and Nails,0
"This one's a story from my (tech-literate, but mostly business-trained) boss.

I work in a big bank, as a financial planner with a sideline in making tools for my department. My boss runs both my department, plus another one that focuses on creating Excel calculators and and supporting various financial planning tools. One of the tools they support (let's call it H) is used by several thousand financial advisors across the country. (Fair warning: I don't work with H at all, so some details here might be slightly off)

There's been an issue for the past few weeks where advisors have been unable to log into H. This is a pretty big deal, and a ton of email has been flying around between the support department, the IT department that runs the servers, management on both ends, and probably a bunch of others trying to figure this all out. My boss gets cc'd on some of these, and about three weeks in he thinks to ask about the authorized users list. Apparently, there's a script that needs to be run occasionally to keep the authorized users up to date (something to do with annual training requirements), and that script had failed. So as users hit their yearly roll-over, they were considered out of date and were blocked from logging in. An IT department and a support department didn't know this, but my boss, the MBA, managed to pinpoint it pretty quickly when he started asking questions. So they fixed the script, and the big outage was over immediately.

"I have a story from 14 years ago that has stuck with me throughout my whole IT career, it was the very first day working front line help-desk support for a government agency that was pretty far behind the cutting edge of technology.

&amp;#x200B;

I received a call from Jane (not her real name).

Jane: Hi IT I am having trouble ejecting this floppy disk.

Me: Hi Jane, ok can you tell me did the you get any errors from the computer or is there any lights flashing on the floppy drive.

Jane: well no errors but it can't see the disk at all, its also making this horrible thumping noise. \*she holds the phone up the the floppy drive and the noise it was making can screeching down the line\*

Me: Ok Jane that isn't normal I'll be right down, what floor are you on?

After getting the details I went to her floor, I took the elevator down, when I came out of the lifts I didn't need to ask where she sat as the floppy drive was doing its best rendition of the drum solo from the song 'In the air tonight' she worked in a small office by herself but the noise was filling most of the floor.

As I arrived to Jane's desk I see two stacks of floppy disks one still in boxes and the other stacked on her desk, the stack on her desk was a pile of broken or warped floppy disks, I assumed they were damaged during storage and didn't ask about them (rookie mistake).

After 10 minutes of me going through my checklist (remember first day on the job) as well as trying to eject the floppy disk or get it t read, Jane starts getting frantic about the drives she tell me ""I've been doing this for hours now, some disks work but some don't I'm worried this drive is breaking these floppies and we don't have any other copies of this data""

Me: ""ok why would you say the drive is breaking them, how many floppies haven't worked?"" I pointed over to the pile of broken disks ""did the drive do this to all of the disks?""

Jane: Those are the ones that didn't work they were getting stuck but once I got them in the drive they came out fine, this is the first one I couldn't eject.

She was right the eject button was really stuck, I decided the safest method was to turn off the PC pull out the floppy drive and manually retrieve the disk.

Upon opening the drive (which took 25 minutes because I was new and really not confident on what I was doing) I finally figured out the issue, the floppy disk was not only back to front but also upside down.

Me: Jane can I ask how did you get this in the drive, its upside down and facing the wrong way?

Jane looks at me like I was exercising a demon from her body after the longest most awkward pauses ever she replies in a soft voice.

Jane: Floppy disks have a right and a wrong way to go into drives?

Me: .........Yes, I really don't understand how you got this in there like this can you show me.

Jane proceeds to pull out a small hammer from under her desk.

Jane: The disks that didn't go in correctly I used this to get them in the drive, why is IT equipment so complicated?

Me: I'm going to have to talk to my manager I'll be back soon.

I'm not exactly sure what happened to poor Jane, she was moved to a different section soon after, I still wonder sometimes if she is now chiselling in USB keys into PC's

"TLDR: At the bottom.

I'm a tech for a copier company.  This is one of the first calls I went out on alone.

Doing the morning routines when i overhear my boss on the phone:  

""Alright, it went through.  I'll send a tech over now.""
""HEY!, MT (me).  I gotta call for you.  They cant scan.  Head over there.  Oh and take a drum and maybe a fuser too.  Their getting black lines.""

I do the needful things and head off.

The customer is a seed company.  Lots of dust in the air (which drives my nose and eyes bonkers).  I think to myself, ""the office should be better than outside.""  It's not.   The office is covered in dirt, and so is the copier.  I'm met by the ""IT Guy."":

""Hey MT I'm IT.  Your copier is really messed up.  It cant print.  Its copy is horrible.  And it won't scan.  You guys haven't taken care of it.  I mean, why do we even have a service contract.""

""Well sir I'm sorry to hear that.  I'll get it fixed up for you.""

The details:  the filthy copier is 10 years old and no longer supported by canon.  I spent about an hour cleaning/repairing.   And replaced every consumable (all were bad).

Moved onto the chargeable portion of the call next.  (Our contracts only cover the copier.  Networking is chargeable).  Decided to fix the printing problem next. But IT requests that I fix the scanning first.  

They scan via smtp using google.  After about 45 minutes of troubleshooting with IT breathing down my neck.  (On old canons to test the smtp you had to actually run a scan.  There was no test button on the rui as there is now).  I determined the cause of the problem.  The new SSL/TLS industry standards had just been implemented.  All major providers switched to the new standards.  And Canon didnt issue a firmware update to reflect the change on this dinosaur. 

I calmly explain this understandable truth to my fellow it professional.   To which IT responds:  ""But it worked just fine yesterday!""

It was at that point when I realized IT wasn't an IT Professional. 

I explain how smtp works.  What and how SSL communication is and works.  Why google won't change their settings to match his standards for his free gmail account.  I explain that Yahoo and Microsoft won't work either.  He responds by asking me to try Outlook.com.  I explain why that won't work.  He asks, ""what about live.com.""  I try that just to appease/crush his hubris.  

I then explained that we could simply use SMB scanning, but that it would need to be on a centralized computer for ease of use.  

""OH, We have a server!  Will that work!""

""F*ck YA IT, that should do the trick!""  (The polite cursing barrier had been crossed by about hour 2).  

IT takes me to the server room.  It's a Walmart box running Windows 10 home.  I ask IT, ""Who set this up?""  He responds proudly,""I Did!"" (Bet you didnt see that one coming).

IT explains that all the print jobs go to this PC and it can now serve as the SMB server too.  

I set up SMB shared folder and have to trek to the copier to test it.  IT wouldn't give me the password so I had him put it in.  3 times I tried to scan, and it failed.  Then I locked the computer and had him unlock it.  ""Oh, oops.  I guess I had the password wrong.""  We (I) get it working.

Everything is solved and I fill out the work order.  Present it to the boss and get an irate response.  

""YOURE CHARGING US???  I JUAT PAID YOU THIS MORNING.""  

""Did you get the email fixed?""  She, the boss, said with visible anger.

""The copiers email cant be fixed."" Said IT.

I explain.  ""The security standards have changed and the copiers out of tech support for canon.  They won't issue an update for the new standards.  But you're able to scan via a shar..."" She cut me off.

""You sold me a Lemon!""

I asked when they bought it.  10 years ago.  I dont respond to the lemon comment.

""I depend on my email scan.  WE NEED IT!""

""If you really want email scan you can pay for a private domain and use an unsecured port to scan from a custom domain.  I'm sure IT could set that up for you.""

""Ugh, ya. Ya I could probably do that.""

""I cant believe that x company would send a tech out that needs my IT to hold their hand.""

At this point I call my boss.  The conversation went like this:

MB is my boss.   BB is thier boss.

I explain to MB the nitty gritty.

MB: let me talk to her.

BB:  your copier is unfixable.  You've sold us a lemon.  The email is broken.

MB:  the copier is not broken.  The technology is just outdated.  My tech provided a way for you to scan.  If you want to email you'll have to setup a server or upgrade. 

BB:  ...pause...

BB:  Why would we upgrade when you let our machine go into disrepair?

MB:  the machine hasn't been serviced because you haven't paid us in over a year.

BB:  I just paid you today.

MB:  Try that with your phone company and see if you get service.

MB:  Look.  Here's a deal.  I'll write this charge call off if you promise to pay the monthly service rate on time.

BB:  Oh, ok.  We will thank you.

I move on to leave.  At the door IT stops me as I'm already halfway to the car.

""Hey, what about the printing problem?""

""Install all the print drivers locally on each PC.""

""Where are the drivers?""

""The internet.""  Shut car door and leave.

PS:  to add to this.  My boss leased a copier to another customer.  The owner of this company is the wife of the owner of the seed company.  We recently sued to get thier 2 years worth of lease payments.  I got the second hand telling of the spectacle the owner caused when he presented a check to MB for the 2 years of a 5 year lease.  With the checks memo reading ""paid in full.""  MB crossed that out and wrote, ""paid up to date.""

TLDR:  Customer who doesn't pay bill complains when we cut off service.  Then complains about getting charged to fix things that are out of the scope of the contract.  And one really stupid "" IT Guy.""",YOUR! Copier (email) is broken.,0

Working for $Small Maintenance Company, I don't get as much IT action as some of the others but every now and again I get a gem of a story albeit little.

*I get to work the same time as boss man/CEO of $SMC. All the computers are off.* 

*$BM walks in with his usual Surface Pro 4. I'm at desk getting things powered on for the day.*

*Been sitting for about 5 minutes winding up to dig into large stack of paperwork because IT isn't my only job here.*

*Haven't been to work for 10 minutes and I'm wondering what is broken now.*

&gt; *$BM*  My monitors won't turn on. I've tried restarting it and I've tried going into ""Project"" settings like you showed me and it won't turn on.

*I am slightly shocked. usually he is forgetful of the small details like that. I'm also impressed.*

*I look and see if the little black box is plugged into the Surface Pro. It is.*

*I go into settings and see what they look like. Both monitors are off.*

*I hit the power buttons on both monitors and hope that's all it is. No dice. Computer still doesn't see either of them.*

&gt; *$LHM* This is strange, usually the computer sees at least one monitor when it's doing stuff like this.

*Out of the corner of my eye, I see something behind the black box. It's a power cord that isn't plugged in.*

&gt;  *$LHM* hmm. What's this go to?

*I pick it up and inspect it for a second and check the back of the black box*

*The power input is missing so I put 2 and 2 together.*

&gt; *$BM* How is that even a thing? How would that have gotten unplugged? I'll put that on my list of things to check for next time this problem comes up. Thank you.

Total time spent troubleshooting and fixing the problem? about 30 seconds.

"Company we're MSP for calls Tuesday morning.

Reygle: Business name, this is Reygle!

Supervisor: Morning, Reygle.  You helped us get our new copier all configured last week in the office, and now when we scan documents to our email accounts, they take upwards of 40 minutes to arrive.

Reygle: That's pretty odd, I know that none of your users agreed to use folders on your server for scans, and everyone wanted scans directly e-mailed to themselves-

Supervisor: We're never going to scan to folders.

Reygle: \**urge to off myself rising\** Yep, we talked about that.  I do recall sending a test email to every user we set up- and that most arrived within the minute. (There were 29 of them)

Supervisor: Yep! I was there with you, all went great.

Reygle: So now, the same types of scans are taking entire lunch breaks to arrive?

Supervisor: That's right.

\---------

*spends 3.5 hours remoted to the scanner's touch panel troubleshooting, as well as remote monitoring station staring at settings that aren't incorrect*

Finds *\*high compression setting we never set, disables it\**

*literally works perfectly every time I ask them to test scan 100 pages*

\---------

*Closes ticket*

45 minutes later:

Reygle: Company name, Reygle speaking!

Supervisor: Hi, scans were great for a bit, then I re-enabled high compression mode and they all slowed back down.

Reygle: Wait- **you RE-enabled** it?  Had you recently turned the feature on before you called with this problem?

Supervisor: ....

Why did you re-enable that?  The 800Mhz processor in your leased copier can't handle the workload while using OCR, which you *really* don't want to go without.  More than maybe 10 pages with that feature on will bring it to a crawl- it's not exactly an enterprise machine.

Supervisor: Oh.  I just scanned 273 pages.

Reygle: That'll arrive next week, maybe never.  Please power cycle the copier if anyone wants to use it for the rest of the day.  Next time you change settings and notice a difference, please let me know before I spend a whole morning billing you.

Supervisor: ...      *incredible pause*      So when I turned that on, I caused this problem?

Reygle: Yes.

Supervisor: What is this going to cost me?

Reygle: 3.5 hours at normal rate.

Supervisor: *longest pause I've ever witnessed in a phone call*  Do you think this is why our last copier was so slow? I had turned it on for that one, too.

Reygle: Have a nice day. *hang up and screams*

"Hey just wanted to share another story that kinda frustrated me but working in IT department you get allot of complaints that could be easily fixed &amp; then you hear the annoying "" IT staff are dumb they don't know shit"". Ofc you work your usual hours &amp; if you go the extra steps you won't get anything in return just more work and no bonus or overtime. Yes no overtime for IT is crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a problem with the IT department honestly but it is because management keeps saying ""Just do it, but I can't accept this cost"". So most of the things we have are based on the little budget we have available. So when the staff ask for tasks that require things over the budget they usually just regret"". Sometimes other departments do something on their own and they cause malware or get infected with ransom ware locking essential files that should be sent to the government, otherwise there would be a fine. The dumb people don't even have back ups. So yea dealing with such people is tiresome. Anyways one of the managers wanted other systems to communicate with each other. That is a problem since some of our software are not compatible or are decades old. So usually is not supported anymore. Upgrading those software will cost millions. I found entire eco systems that are cost effective and are up to date &amp; can do all the things we want.""

&amp;#x200B;

My manager said "" Why would we go for a Camry when we have a Ferrari"" .

Basically my manager wanted the Ferrari 2019 without the cost. So all the alternatives are bad to him.

I was confused I said in my mind "" we have a Ferrari on life support  &amp; fixing that Ferrari cost us millions""

I replied "" Well our current Ferrari cannot do what you ask, a new Ferrari cost x10 the cost of this software, so you have a choice of either choosing this alternative, getting the new Ferrari or just decline your request. I just want you to know that this isn't IT department fault this is your decision after all. So do not blame IT""

The manager said "" You know what I like our existing system, yea I won't ask you to do that task"".

Update: just remembered this. You see I work in IT not only as designer, consultant, web developer but also as system analyst. So usually I talk to the team and we make plans for the projects. One of the managements decided to outsource a system using a different language that is ill informed of our existing systems and requirements. The COO gave me the lead first I talked to my team and asked the correct questions. Also made appointment with our department with workflows ready so that they understand our current system and where the data is fed from. Some software are required and cannot be replaced so a connector is mandatory. I talked to the sales people "" yes the COO of my company and sales person from outsourcing company never allowed me to communicate with developers directly"". What is worse is that the sales person did not have the skills to understand or reply to my questions or understand our systems. The sales team did not like to talk to me cause I talked specifics. I also found their flaws and COO got angry with them and shouted "" you do not tell us how we do our business"". That is because the sales team weren't good with communication. 

I'm not bashing sales people most sales people I met are great and well informed of their own services, they are also good listeners. This company however had bad sales team. 

I told COO "" can I please talk to developers directly, I think there is a language barrier, I want to talk to a developer""

My COO basically removed me and in fact removed all IT from our company to look into this project. So the only communication is between outsourcing company and COO directly. My IT manager said wise words "" Quote him and post this date, so that if he tries to blame this on us you will remind him that it was his decision to exclude IT team from responsibility"".","Manager wanted the impossible, then gets shutdown",0
"Obligatory “I’m on mobile so excuse any formatting weirdness but I tried my best.”

So I work in a store for a major wireless carrier in the US. My job is primarily sales, but we do get tech support requests from time to time. These run the gamut from pretty basic stuff like doing a soft reset or (my personal favorite) flipping the silent switch on the side of an iPhone, to more involved things like signal issues and devices not powering on. Anyways, onto the story!

A woman came in with her teenage son. She had just bought him a new phone a few months prior as a birthday gift. According to the son, he put it on the charger when he went to bed and it wouldn’t power on in the morning. I did some basic troubleshooting like trying a few different cables and cleaning any dust or funk out of the charging port. Still nothing. Phone won’t even acknowledge that it’s plugged in. Oh, bother.

The phone was still under warranty, and at this point that looked like the next step in my process. Now the warranty does not cover physical or liquid damage, and if the customer sends back the device and the warehouse finds any damage they will be charged a fee for it.

As the woman and I wait on hold for tech support- we aren’t able to do warranty replacements in carrier stores- I inspect the phone a bit more closely. The son swears up and down that there was no damage to the phone and it didn’t come into contact with any liquid, but I still have to check for any and all damage. No damage to the body or screen, buttons feel nice and clicky...but there’s condensation on the rear camera. I open the SIM tray and shine a flashlight into the phone, and what do you know- the water damage indicator is a nice shade of pink. It’s supposed to be white. Yup, definitely water damage. Oh, bother...again.

I explain this to the woman- who is still on hold by the way- and she doesn’t believe me at first. I show both her and her son the condensation in the rear camera, as well as the indicator inside of the phone. Sorry, it’s water damage. Warranty won’t cover it. 

I can tell she’s mad, but less at me and more at the situation and her son. I press him a little more, asking if he could think of any possivle way the phone would have gotten wet, even if it was just condensation. Turns out he got into a fight with some kids at his school and they shoved him into a snowbank when his phone was in his pocket. The phone got wet, his ass got wet, and his ego likely got a bit bruised.

The woman look at him and said “Oh, that’s fine. Things happen. Tell you what; I have my old flip phone back at the house somewhere. We can just activate that for you to use.” In my neck of the woods, giving a flip phone to a high schooler is apparently tantamount to a big red A on their shirt, to reference one of my least favorite books I had to read when I was in high school.

TL;DR: Kid lied to his mom about water damage on his shiny new phone. The phone stopped working and the truth eventually came out. Now he has a flip phone that might be as old as he is.","Lying won’t get you anywhere, kid.",0
"Hi all, no pre-amble, I'll get straight onto the story.

Working in IT, got a call from a user saying their PC keeps turning off.  Asked the usual questions to work out if the PC is shutting down, or is it the screen going blank, etc.  End result of the conversation was that the PC was cutting out completely and needed powering back on via the On/Off button.

I headed up the two flights of stairs to the user expecting a loose power cable, but once under the desk I was surprised to find the power cable nice and secure.  Then looked at dust build up and fans thinking overheating, but everything seems to be fine.

I asked if there's any pattern to the cut outs - does it happen when using a particular application, or at particular times of the day, etc.  She says no, but after a bit of prodding says it often happens after she catches the PC with her foot.

Thinking maybe an internal loose connection, I give the PC a few shakes and a few taps around the case but the PC remains quietly well behaved.  I tell her it seems to be working fine.  She then says ""No, it's happens when I catch it with my foot...""

**SMACK**

From out of nowhere, she kicks the PC so hard I thought she was trying to clear a goal kick into the opponents half!  Sure enough, the PC cuts power, and she looks very happy she's been able to demonstrate the problem.

I tell her PCs are not designed to take that kind of punishment and it's no wonder it's shutting down!  I then get back under her desk and move the PC and cables to the other side, so it's behind her drawer unit and not in the area her feet are.  I show her where the PC is now, and say this should solve it as she now cannot catch it with her feet.

""Oh, no.  I can't have it there.  Where am I going to rest my feet?!?!""

""You shouldn't be using your PC as a foot rest!  How about we get you an actual foot rest?""

""No, the foot rests are too low.  The CPU is just the right height.  Put it back.""

After shuddering that she's referring to her base unit as her 'CPU', I inform her that the PC is staying where I've put it, I'm ordering her a foot rest and she will just have to learn to live with it.

Had a request a few weeks later from her boss to 'Put her tall foot rest back where she can use it"", so had to call them and explain what the situation actually was - boss had a good laugh and told me he'd sort it out with her.  Never heard anything more from either of them.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT** \- Wow!  Thank you very much for the Silver. :)  There are a LOT more comments than I was expecting, so apologies if I don't respond to yours but I promise I will read them all.

For those understandably questioning why IT is involved in getting a foot rest, my job at the time was the on-site IT/odd-job person and there was no actual role profile, so I'd spend my time repairing PCs, building Excel spreadsheets for management information collation, making PowerPoint presentations for the Centre Manager, ordering supplies for anything that didn't fall under the title of stationery (mice, keyboards, monitors, foot stands, wireless mics and speakers), and anything else that didn't fall into someone else's job title and could be badged as 'IT related' by top management.  Fun times and I learned a little about a lot of subjects.",PC keeps turning off (sure we've all run into this one),0
" I don't know if this is exactly the right place for this but I guess the comments will decide.

Background: Back in the early '90s I was a computer programmer for the army and one of my duties was to maintain systems that transferred officer and enlisted records from my duty station up to and down from the department of the army. These records were the changes to soldier’s personnel files and were pretty important because they would not get paid for new ranks if finance in D.C. wasn’t aware of their promotions.

The system we had to use was a few years old and worked fine (but very slow), the problem we had was that the phone lines in our building were VERY old. So old that they still used cloth rather than rubber as insulation and were very finicky in how they had to be kept for them to work properly. We had so many problems with keeping the phone lines working that the computer was kept in a certain location and never moved or the connection would not work due to the physical stress the phone line was under (its own weight) and we couldn’t connect to D.C.

The story: I was but a lowly E-4 Specialist (SPC) and worked by myself downstairs as the 2 E-5’s had moved on to other bases and their replacements had not yet arrived to replace them. The fact that 2 SPCs (there was another SPC downstairs doing a different, very easy job, as he was waiting to be medically discharged) were working unsupervised downstairs really got on the nerves of a E-6 Staff Sergeant (SSG) upstairs who didn’t have a whole lot of work after I had created a program that did 90% of his previous work. Since this SSG now had much less work to do he was forced by our E-7 Sergeant First Class (SFC) to assist in the data entry section which I think he was not happy with.

The SSG talked with our SFC and had the great idea that he should spend ½ his time supervising me and the other SPC who worked downstairs because ofcourse 2 SPC can’t be trusted not to f things up. As a SPC I had no say in the matter so I now had a SSG supervising me that had no IT experience and no understanding of the weird issues we had with the wiring downstairs.

Well of course once the SSG began his supervisory role downstairs his first order of business was to move everything around to suit whatever vision he had of how the furniture should be set up. The other SPC and I began moving the heavy as hell desks around in a way that the SSG had told us to until it came to moving the desk with the data transfer computer. This desk was against the wall with permanent marker where the legs should be, electrical tape on the desk to mark where the computer should be, and was never to be moved because of the wiring issue. I informed the SSG that if this computer was moved at all I did not think I would be able to connect to D.C. to do our data transfers. The SSG was not impressed with my explanation and forced us to move the desk while I once again told him this was a bad idea. He also had us try and clean the floor and desk of the permanent marker, but we were unable to full get it clean (thankfully).

Over the next week and a half I had to report to our SFC every afternoon that we were having comms issues and were unable to transfer our daily updates. When Thursday of the second week came around our SFC came into our section and wanted an update on our comms issues as we were missing over a week’s worth of updates as well as our “large” monthly download of records they needed upstairs to update their systems. I tried to explain that the issue was with the location of the computer, and the stress on the old wiring, but I was interrupted by the SSG that I complaining too much about the issue (which of course I did as I knew how to fix the issue I had to report everyday) and I needed to just do my job and fix the problem. The SFC told me to just fix the problem and I started doing everything I knew how to over the next few hours to try and get the computer to connect. None of it worked, and at the end of the day I had to once again report that we were unable to send data.

On the next morning the SSG and SFC came down stairs and the SSG started to tear into me about how I was a shitty “computer guy” and how it shouldn’t take almost 2 weeks to fix a simple issue with a computer. After being told I was basically a P.O.S. for 10 minutes, I got pissed, snapped, and I told the SSG off and that this issue was completely his fault and that I was F’n done with his crap and then walked out to the front of the building. This kind of thing would, in most cases, have caused me to get in a lot of trouble and probably even lose a rank or 2. My SFC came out to the front of the build and asked me WTF was going on as I was not known for being disrespectful to leadership and I explained to him that all the issues I had to report to him every day were caused by the SSG moving “that god damn transfer computer”.

The SFC decided to let me prove my point and asked the SSG to go back upstairs (which he smugly did as he knew the failure was because I didn’t know what I was doing) while telling me to get the computer working in any way I needed to. I knew that if I was unable to fix it that it would be my ass on the line. I asked the other SPC to help me move the desk and computer back into its original location and line it up with the marks on the floor and push the computer into the marks on the desk as it had been located in the past. 10, very stressful, minutes later I was transferring the last weeks’ worth of data up to D.C. (after f’n with that god damned phone line for a bit) and preparing to download the needed data (which we usually did over night as it was very large for the time and the data rates were very slow). I then went upstairs and reported to my SFC that comms were back up and by that afternoon we should have the files needed to update their systems.

The other SPC and I spent the rest of the time I was in that unit unsupervised downstairs, the permanent marker was redrawn on the desk and floor, and the SSG continued to do data entry upstairs with the SFC.",The black marks are there for a reason.,0
"I assisted the IT guy, John, at an elementary school for a while. John was both a teacher and head of IT, so he didn't always have time for support. Here I met Kevin. Kevin was also a teacher and technically challenged.

Kevin needed to print something, but the toner filter was full. The staff are supposed to call John or me to service the printers. Kevin didn't want to wait, so he found a *screwdriver* and tried replacing the filter himself. Kevin and the small room where covered in black toner powder. I explained to him that printers don't need screwdrivers for this sort of thing.

He learned nothing from this. Some time later, he needed to print again, but the printer was out of yellow ink. This printer used long, see-through cylinders full of colored powder. Again, he didn't want to wait, so he pulled out the yellow ink cylinder and tried inserting a new one. It didn't fit, because he grabbed the wrong one; it was for a different model of printer. So, Kevin *kicked it in*. Kevin and the small room were covered in yellow powder. Luckily, the printer wasn't damaged and John told Kevin not to try anything like this again.

Another time, Kevin came into my office with an external hard drive he had brought from home. It wasn't working and he asked me to look at it. Right away, I noticed that he had brought the wrong power supply for the drive. I mentioned this and he said that this was the power supply that came with it. It clearly wasn't, since the drive had the Western Digital logo on it, and the power supply said Toshiba on the back. He still wasn't convinced and we went back and forth a little bit, until John came in and assured Kevin that I was correct. Anyway, I opened up the external casing, but couldn't see any damage. I tried hooking it up to my laptop with a SATA to USB adapter, but I got no reaction. I could only assume that it was fried, because he used the wrong power supply.

Otherwise, Kevin was a pleasant enough guy and we got along well, when he wasn't wrecking electronics.

I was only hired for a year, to assist John setting up new equipment and preparing most of the building for an updated IT system, since he didn't have the time to do both that and teach. It was probably the best job I've ever had. Plenty to do and wonderful, appreciative people. I really miss it.

**Edit**: Thank you for all your stories. I just remembered something funny I would like to add. Early one morning, a teacher called me saying that the smart-board in her classroom wasn't working. It was one of those touch-sensitive whiteboards that plugs into a computer. The screen is projected onto the whiteboard, so you can ""draw"" on the screen with your fingers. Anyway, class was starting in 15 minutes, so I ran down there to try and fix it in time.

Nothing I did seemed to help. I restarted, updated drivers, checked calibration, force closed and restarted the software, but got nowhere. Then class begins and all the kids start filing in and sitting down. I'm fiddling away like mad, because the teacher was so nice and friendly and I really wanted to help her. Then one boy comes up to me and asks me what I'm doing.

""Your smart-board isn't working right and trying to fix it. Looks like I'm not going to make it in time for your class, hehe.""

""Did you try unplugging the USB cable and plugging it back in?""

I actually facepalmed hard, in front of the whole class and asked the boy to try it. Lights flashed and a message popped up saying that the smart-board was connected. I did a quick test and told the boy he did a good job, then left the classroom in literal shame.",A few short stories from a previous workplace that I miss dearly.,0
"I like to bake. I'm willing bake something for going away parties, Halloween, or what have you, and it's something I'm pretty decent at. I like to show that I'm not just the IT guy, but that I'm a well rounded person when the occasion calls for it. The last time I baked something, it was for a going away party for a coworker I actually liked. [It was a coconut cake, made from scratch, with seven minute frosting.](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/coconut-cake-with-7-minute-frosting-recipe-1953530) This cake takes four hours to make, and I only made it because I knew that she loved it and she was headed off to Hawaii. Thematically appropriate, I'd say.

Today I got a help desk ticket to bake a coconut cake because they ""haven't had one in a while.""

I thought they were asking for another coworker who's leaving soon, she's not from that department, no one in that department likes her, and she doesn't like coconut. I like her just fine so she's getting banana pudding.

"It’s almost lunchtime at the $Hosptial helpdesk. I could barely hear the phone ringing over my stomach rumbling. I’m busy battling Chipolte’s website to get some lunch, so Hippie answers the phone for me.

&gt;Hippie: IT, this is Hippie.

&gt;Caller: Hi, this is Melissa from $RemoteOffice. I have a problem with my computer and I was hoping you could help me fix it ASAP

&gt;Hippie: OK, no worries, what’s up?

&gt;Caller: Uh…I don’t know how to say this, but I think I broke it. 

&gt;Hippie: What do you mean, broke your computer? What’s wrong with it? You can’t login?

&gt;Caller: No, it will barely do anything at all?

&gt;Hippie: That sucks. What happened to it?

&gt;Caller: Well, my cat walked across the keyboard and now it’s not working very well

&gt;Hippie: Hahaha, yeah man, my cats do that all the time. We should be able to fix it no problem. Are you locked out of your account now or???

&gt;Caller: No, the keyboard doesn’t seem to be working quite right. Some of the keys look funny now

&gt;&gt;Hippie: Uh, man, that really doesn’t sound like an easy fix. If you can give me a few minutes, I’ll figure out something and call you back.

&gt;Caller: Oh dear, I was hoping you guys could just fix it now. I’d rather my boss not find out. She would be really mad. I might just keep using it. It still kinda works, but it’s hard to type.

&gt;Hippie: No worries, we should be able to figure something out very soon. I’ll call you back ASAP.

&gt;Caller: Oh great, thanks. The sooner the better, I really don’t want my boss to find out.   *click*

Hippie fills me in and we decide, heck with it. We grab a new laptop and get it imaging. Whatever happened to her laptop, we don’t have any parts on hand, and they’re not going to wait for parts to be ordered in.

That much of the situation sorted, Hippie calls her back

&gt;Hippie: Hi Melissa, this is Hippie from IT. Just calling back to get some more info on your laptop. We’re working on a solution as we speak; just wanted to make sure i’m on the right track.

&gt;Melissa: Oh that’s great. I’ll do whatever I can to help. What sort of info did you need?

&gt;Hippie: Well, first off, what kind of laptop is it?

&gt;Melissa: It’s a Dell

Big oof. Any Dells we had were close to ten years old. It’s way past the refresh cycle. Now there’s no doubt that replacing it was the right move.

&gt;Hippie: OK thanks, that’s just what I need to know. We can’t do anything to fix it, but we can, uh, loan you another one, if you want to stop by today and get it. Now I really gotta ask, what exactly happened to it?

Unfortunately for Hippie, we didn’t get a straight answer, but not long after that, Melissa showed up with an elderly Dell Lattitude that was missing several keys and generally looked like it lost a fight with every sledgehammer ever made. 

She seemed nervous and was very reticent to accept her “loaner” laptop until I labeled it “MELISSAS LOANER LAPTOP”. Somehow that sticker made everything OK and she left with her new laptop.

Melissa’s job meant that she worked very closely with her boss, so her boss found out about the new laptop in about 2 seconds. Boss lady called, more curious than anything, and we explained that Melissa’s elderly laptop had met its fate and we’d replaced it. Boss lady was entirely unperturbed by this news. Being as IT savvy as she was, boss understood that fixing aged computers was pointless. I'm sure it helped that Corporate paid for the replacement since it was overdue...

A few weeks later, Hippie was helping Melissa again and ended up speaking with Melissa’s husband. It seems she needed our help but couldn’t get to the phone. Over the course of the conversation, her husband tells Hippie all the details Melissa left out of the laptop saga. It seems that Melissa had been working from home that day and had placed her running laptop on a very high shelf so she could take a break. Cat jumps on the shelf and lands on the laptop.

I work 1. Line support at an ISP which also provides a TV solution similar to cable, but transmitted through the Internet.


A woman called in to notify us about a problem with one of the channels we provide (not unusual. Our service is pretty New, so there are some faults with induvidual channels that We're working om to fix).


The conversation went like this (paraphrased):


Me: Welcome to $ISP, my name is Ayybrul how may I be of assistance.


Woman: Hi! There's an issue with one of the channels on your service.


Me: Allright, which channel is it and what's the issue?


Woman: $Channel is stuck on just one programme, it never changes!


This seems like a weird problem to have. At first I'm thinking she's unable to change the channel, but she assures me she is able to do that. The only issue is the one channel which is stuck sending bridal dresses for the past 3 days straight (according to the customer).


Me: We have a TV-set installed in our break area. You would you mind holding the line for a moment while I double check if this is an issue with the channel on all devices, or just yours?


Woman: Of course not! Go ahead, I'll Wait.


I walk over to the TV, open up the TV-guide, and sure enough. $channel has been sending the same show for quite a while with no other shows in between. But this is obviously how the channel set up the schedule, not an issue in itself.


I head on back to inform the customer of this.


Me: I'm back again, Thanks for waiting. It seems like this is how $channel decided to plan their scheduling. It's not an issue on our or your end.


Woman: Are you joking?? Who in their right mind would want to watch people try on dresses for hours on end??


Me: I'm afraid I'm serious. I can only reccomend you find another channel to watch while waiting for other shows to be scheduled.


Woman: Oh trust me I will! Thanks for the help!

"This should be pretty short. (First time starting a post here; not sure if I have to add the 'Short' tag or not? It says it's disabled for me.)

One of our testers never restarts her machine because she doesn't want to lose her scripts. At the time of this incident, we had a new one prepped to switch out for her as she'd been complaining about everything being slow and the machine locking up and forcing a restart. Of course, I'd take a look and find the system completely locked up as a result of just how much she had running and open at once. I explained that she'd need to restart the machine and she lost it; she started yelling at me about how she shouldn't have to restart because she had all these scripts open that she'd written. I explain that there's no other choice as the entire system had locked up completely and she would need to reopen the saved versions...

Tester: ""What saved versions!? I don't save these; that's why I just keep the tabs open!""Me: ""Wait what? What do you do when there's an update that requires a restart?""Tester: ""I just don't update!""Me: ""... Okay, then. Well, I suggest you start saving your work from time to time until we get your new one and finish setting it up.""Tester: ""And what do I do in the meantime!? You want me to just keep redoing all my work from the beginning!?""Me: ""I mean, you're going to have to do that or save your work every so often.""Tester: ""YOU EXPECT ME TO REMEMBER TO SAVE!?

"Back story- I was in the army, working IT. I wore many hats to include network/systems security. This was a time before WSUS and before Window 2000 became mainstream on my network. The network was scanned with Harris Technologies Retina auditing software, which produced ""bad system"" reports that fingered out systems that needed to be ""hand stroked"" (patched) into compliance. We used Dameware (loved it) at the time to remote in and work the systems. Computer security was not really taken seriously. We tried to educate our users, but fell on blind eyes and deft ears. Until one day..

me- I was cruising through the audit report, working systems. I'd ID a system, send a message to the system instructing the user to log out and allow me to take control of the system to do the update. I would also ""fish bowl"" (watch the remote system for activity) when I did this. One particular system I sent off the message, no response. The system was logged in and on a desktop. I went back to the other 3 systems I had open and worked them before coming back to this one.  Still no activity. Hmmm... It belongs to Col. Jones.. Let's take a look at his email.. Hmmm.. Not set up.. I call the POC number for this user. Rang 5 times and went to voice mail. I call someone in his office to see if he's around. ""No, he's over at the hangar for the day and his door is locked"" was the response. Ooook.. I configured his email and started composing an email..  Subject: I left my computer unsecured. ""I left my computer unsecured. I know this is a dumb move but I did it.  Someone could have used my unsecured computer to give my entire staff the day off, cursed out a general, or emailed the supply section to order 10,000 gallons of rocky-road ice cream. A lot of damage could have been done, just because I did not lock my computer.""  Ok.. Not too harsh.. Lets add snuffy's ""100 closest friends"". Letsee.. Yep. Send it to all of his colonel buddies, the 1 star, the 2 star, and my big boss.

Big wig meetings were held once a week. Every one of those colonels will be at that meeting, to include Snuffy. Tomorrow was the next meeting..  My big boss goes to these meetings and was already prepared with his response. The meeting starts and this email is at the top of the list of things to discuss.

Jones- (holds up a printed copy of the email) I want to know who did this. I want action taken against this individual and I want them punished. 

Boss- Why punish him? He was doing his job. You left your computer wide open and worse could've been done than just sending a email to everybody here.  You should probably thank him for not ordering 10,000 gallons of ice cream. 

Jones- I did secure my computer! I locked my office door and walked out!

Boss- Uh, no. You left your desktop unsecured. SGT. Snuffy did not need a key to your office. The network connection bypassed your physical security. You could have had armed guards posted at your office door and this still would've happened. Every body at this table needs to understand cyber security and be aware of it. I'm not punishing him for your failure.

(I was punished, sort of. I ended up having to give cyber security awareness class for NCODP and later ODP. It was a PowerPoint presentation with question/answer time afterwards. As an exit prize, participants received a home-use check list and CD containing anti-virus software, registry cleaners and malware scrubbers.

"So this is a funny story about the time a first line tech support called me, in third line support, about a store email not working.

So I spend my morning just looking at tickets and closing them. Then i get a call from a first line tech saying the store email isn't working and if the internet is down he told me he was connected to the store using remote desktop so puzzled that he thought internet was down. I connect to the store and check emails. Can see them and he's connected to email server then he said he sent a test mail and it didn't come through. I then checked the settings and I find he didn't have it on sort by date he had it in sort by name so I adjust that and can see all the emails that were sent. I laugh about it with him and then proceeded to write documentation on how to sort emails by date and send it to the helpdesk for future reference do they don't waste third lines time with pointless calls.

"So my parents owned a baby goods retailer for the last 15 years, they have since sold it and are much happier with the reduced stress.

During that time they moved from being a purely bricks and mortar store with traditional leaflet marketing to an online store with an online marketing as well a bricks and mortar store.

They brought me along for the ride and I built and maintained anything remotely related to IT. Restarting the router, keeping the internet and phones running, printer troubleshooting, that was me. Running cat6 cable, installing file servers, and security cameras, yup me. Building a website, managing the web and email hosting, installing a speaker intercom system, you guessed it.

After they sold the business I was free. But so that the person coming after me wouldn't be completely lost I wrote a handover document on how everything had been set up as well a password vault with any relevant information they would need. This included the config of the business grade fiber connected to a pfsense box i built.

I get a call from the new business owner about 6 months after the handover. Internet has been down for 5 days, he doesn't know what is happening and is far from a digital native. Being nice I helped out as much as i could over the phone, restart this, try that. Ultimately i couldn't help much over the phone. Wished them luck recommended they call the ISP.

Cut to a week later, I get a call from a tech they had hired asking for guidance on how the network had been set up. Turns out the reason the internet stopped working was they didn't like paying $850/month for business fiber and canceled the service. They forgot to order a replacement service though. Funny how the internet stops working for 2 weeks when disconnected. When they finally got the replacement service they opted for ADSL at a location that will be lucky to get 5Mbps/0.1Mbps. Have fun running your online business.

I later found out through the grape vine they had fired there digital marketing firm, turns out online isn't their focus anymore. They decided to spend the extra money on letter box leaflets.

"Years ago I worked tech support for a company that made an automotive scanner that ran software similar to a dealer tool for multiple car lines, they broke somewhat frequently, and we offered loaners for units coming in for repair. Our one requirement was that the shop had to give us a tracking number that said their unit was picked up by ups/fedex/etc. first.

Also relevant to the story is that when we sell the tool it comes in a hard, laser cut foam lined case. The scanners are pretty beefy themselves, I've had to destroy them before disposal before (proprietary stuff they'd like to make as difficult as possible to recover) and it took some WORK, so even in the poorest of packing conditions these scanners don't get physically damaged, the cases are mostly for storage and transporting so nobody absentmindedly drops a spanner on the screen.

One day, Bob calls (not his real name, I don't even remember it). He needs a loaner for his busted unit, we give him the standard ""send us a tracking number"" line. No word for a few days, ticket is still open, another call from Bob.

Bob: ""Where's my loaner?""  
Me: ""I apologize, we never received any tracking info on your unit, was it sent out?""  
Bob: ""No, I haven't shipped it, I was waiting until I got my loaner.""  
Me: ""I understand, however in order for a loaner to be sent (yada yada)""  
Bob: ""I need that loaner sent pronto.""  
Me: ""Certainly, I'll ensure it's sent overnight as soon as we receive your tracking info.""

He inevitably hangs up, grumbling, and we don't hear from him until the next week.

Bob: ""Why haven't I gotten my loaner yet? Do you realize how much work I've lost because I don't have that damn loaner? You've cost me over $10,000!""  
Me: ""Well, We never got any tracking info. Has your unit been shipped?""  
Bob: ""No, I keep telling you I'll ship it as soon as I get the loaner! You can trust me!"" (fat chance)  
Me: ""If your scanner doesn't work and you're losing ten grand in jobs why not just send us your broken scanner?""  
Bob: ""Well, I want to send it back with the box you guys send out.""  
Me: ""We send loaners in a cardboard box and some bubble wrap. Are you saying you lost $10,000 because you didn't want to spend $5 on a cardboard box and some bubble wrap?""

Silence as the gears turned on the other side of the line. He eventually realized how bad he fucked up,

He asked about the hard cases we send new tools in, and I had to explain that they were heavy, bulky, and expensive to ship, so we don't bother with them on loaners, they easily weigh 10 lbs on their own. He never even sent us the tracking number, his scanner just showed up for repair the next day.","The ""$10,000"" cardboard box",0
"Brother with his laptop (he is 40+ and he has used computers for atleast 20 years): ""How do I connect to the WiFI"".

Silence....

Me internally: very tense knowing he has gone from 0 to 100..shocked tho it's happening just for Wi-Fi

Brother: ""Is that how you explain it to your IT clients?"" In the world's most condescending and angry tone.. but not yelling.

Me: ""oh I've seen you connect to the Wi-Fi before on windows 7 and XP, it's very similar, I didn't want to patronize you.. but anyway just click on the little 'watermelon' symbol that you can see on the bottom right and then click the name of SSID"".

"My company ships out servers to clients which runs a slightly customized flavor of linux.

George: yeah hi, I just got one of your servers, but I'm a little stumped on the setup.

George: Yeah, got it all plugged in and turned on, but I'm stuck half way through the uhh, lifecycle setup thingy.

George: Yes sir! I was going through the booklet that was in the box with the server, but got a little stuck on one of the questions and now I'm calling you to help me out.

Yes Georgie, yes you did.

"I work in IT and I mostly work behind the scenes but sometimes I do get requests from help desk and I go there to assist. Also when I come home my family and relatives keep pushing me to help them fix their issues. So this time there is an issue with my parents ISP provider. The router needs to be refreshed from ISP side. Is a fibre modem, so usually the same box supports phone line and internet. Only issue was internet. I talked to support using the land line cause they usually ask if I want support I should use same landline.

The the person in the phone line must have been tired or something cause he confused the fuck out of me. 

I usually did the basic steps before I made the call. Checking config page testing if it is from our side or their side. Checking if turning it off for 10 minutes. Nothing fixed it, so I made the call. I told the person my steps.

Support: ""Is the telephone line connected""

Me: ""umm yes, do you mean this telephone line that I'm using to call you that is connected to fibre modem""

Support: "" yes, check if cable is connected properly""


Me confused "" do you mean ethernet cable connected to router or th telephone line. Cause I'm calling you on this line. Is there any other telephone line I'm not aware off. ""

Support "" yes remove the telephone cable and put it back again ""

Me confused "" ummm the telephone would be disconnected, you are aware of that right? You want me to contact you again after I disconnect. Also issue is with internet not telephone so I'm confused""

Support "" can you please do that please""

Me "" okay *click""

I redial 

Support ""hello sir seems like the telephone is working fine now""

I did the biggest facepalm in my life.

I said "" What do you mean telephone is working fine it was already working fine. I called you using the same line. The problem is with the internet not telephone. Can you please just make sure to check the issue""

"Recap for those of you who don't know; I'm a technical advisor for CCTV products which includes a lot of IT. Most of our customers have adequate IT-knowledge to being able to do their job (general IT knowledge such as understanding subnet masks, use of PCs, etc etc) but the small percentage does not.

Backstory;

Customer calls me and tells me one of his cameras is broken. I tell him to send the device to me first before shipping it over to RMA so I can have a closer look. I check the device, I find out the firmware got corrupted (probably caused by a bad file). I flash the device, works again, nice and dandy, I reset the device and send it back over to him.

2 weeks later I get a call.

Me: Me - Customer:HiDoggy!

&gt;**Me:** Hello, Me speaking.  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!**: Yes, hello Me, how do I access the webpage of the device?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Oh, you just log onto the default IP-address of the camera. It's x.  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!**: I did... It's not working.  Did you send me a broken camera?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Strange... No, let me check through teamviewer please.

I teamviewer his PC and see that he's connected to the webpage.

&gt;**Me:** Okay. Well, the webpage is working, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** No, no it's not.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** What's the problem?  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** Well I can't log onto the device if you changed the password, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Me? When did I do that?  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** When the camera was sent to you!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:**  I definitely reset the device. Standard practice for us.  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** No no, it  was like this when I already got it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Sir, I guarantee you, I did not change your password. The device should prompt an initialisation process that tells you to put in a password yourself.  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** I...uh... No, you changed the password!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Did you get a prompt to do so?  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** I don't remember. But you definitely changed the password! The device went to you!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Look, once again, I guarantee you that I did not. Well, I did to tes-  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** Aha, see? So type in the password you changed it to.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** No, I changed it to test certain things but afterwards I reset the entire device.  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** No! Not possible! Clearly YOU already put in a password!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Ok, put in a password you usually use for you devices.

&gt;**HiDoggy!** No no, that won't work. Trust me.

"So I got a call from a friend who wanted their PC to connect to their network with wireless... except they had no wireless card. I provided them with some spares that I had and they went back to their PC.

So, a little while later, I get another call asking for help with installing the card. I explained the need to remove the blanking plate and slot a card that matched into the motherboard slot. They did that and powered up their machine, but we couldn't see the card. It wasn't in Device Manager, so I suggested that either the card wasn't fully inserted, it was a dead card, or there was a fault with the motherboard. They checked, and found the card wasn't fully home, so we tried again, but still, no Wireless card in the Device Manager.

The PC ended up on my desk... the blanking plate had been removed, but from the card, and the card was inserted the wrong way round!

To my amazement, when I turned the card around it worked and I demonstrated wifi access to a relieved user.

"I work at a small telecom company and we provide copper lines that we offer DSL &amp; phone over or in new areas (that we are still expanding) we offer speeds upwards of 1gig (if the customer can pay we offer faster but have to strike up a special deal. I once saw a host running 10gig with a specialized ONT and IMac).  At the time of the story I have been working at *ISP* just over a year. I’ve been studying Net+ since its directly related to my job and I am decently knowledgeable when it comes to networking and my job is spread wide enough I have to do some things that would be considered higher tiers or even sys.admin.

But at *ISP* we have one tier total for all calls and if you don’t bug sys.admin the more they like you. Especially when you thoroughly document and provide information. Which in this particular case I did. Repeatedly. This customer I dealt with is one if you say the name aloud in the call center everyone is suddenly tense. She bought a insurance program from us that for a low monthly payment if your internet stops working, even on the customer side of the demarc and inside the customers home we will dispatch a trouble ticket for an installer fix it for “no charge”. But there are steps to aquire such a magical ticket as abuse of this could cost a company significantly.


**begin scene 1**


&gt;**OP**: Hello, **ISP** tech support. How can I help you?


&gt;**already frustrated customer**: Yes hi. My internet is down. you need to send someone out to fix it.


&gt;**OP**: Okay. Well, before I can submit a ticket there are some steps we need to take first, are you getting any particular error? 


&gt;**Frustrated customer** huffs and I hear some clicking: yes there is! My computer says *could not join network* could you just send someone to fix it?


&gt;**op**: we sure can, but I need to check some things first.




This is where I was already looking at her extensive history on how she would yell at techs on call as soon as she starts to feel if she doesn’t get her way, so immediately I started to document everything. Her modem/router (that I will refer to as just router from her on out.) was online her ping times were great her signal strength from the DSL equipment on our end to her router looked very good as well  she was definitely getting the speeds she was paying for. But I wanted to cover all my bases. I use a tool on the router to have the router itself ping a domain or IP and display the results in the gui, and surprise surprise 0% packet loss to google.com,  and her router has been up since the last time she called.


&gt;**OP**: *unreasonably frustrated customer* do you think you could restart you router for me?


&gt;**frustrated customer** even bigger huff: well, I ALREADY did that. And I determined that it’s the lines. Check the lines!


&gt;**OP**: I need you to do it anyway and ill rest some equipment on my end.


Frustrated customer unplugs router and instantly plugs it back in 


&gt;**frustrated customer**: okay I did it


Total time elapsed of the router being off: .000001 seconds


&gt;dying inside **OP**: ma’am I will need you to leave It unplugged for longer than that, our equipment needs about 15 seconds before plugging it back in.
&gt;**frustrated customer**: fine!


**Frustrated Customer** complies and *router reboots and is still the MVP of this call*



&gt;**OP**: can you try connecting again for me?


Shockingly her internet doesn’t work still. I had a feeling from the start that there is something LAN side causing issues. Either her windows 10 PC or the 3rd party router (DLink) that I see in the ARP table. 


*when in doubt blame windows*



&gt;**frustrated customer**: it still doesn’t work, I’m telling you someone needs to come fix this NOW. I’m paying a lot of money for this!


&gt;**OP**: okay lets restart your DLink AP (probably a router, no way a customer has the concept of what double NAT could even bother them with usually)


&gt;**frustrated customer**: I will, but I KNOW it’s not the problem. I know it’s THE –bad word- LINES. And you’re wasting my time!!!



It’s at this point I get excited to embarrass her with how disgustingly nice my tone has been the whole time and she had been rude and profane (profanities omitted) because I was 75% sure that it was the DLink. She probably has an ancient wifi B/G/N AP that belongs in the dump. And if it wasn’t that definitely windows 10.



&gt;**frustrated customer**: okay I restarted it


&gt;**OP**: could you try connecting for me again?


&gt;**frustrated customer**: ….okay I think it’s working. BUT you still need to send someone out to CHECK THE LINES. I have *insurance plan*





&gt;**OP**:okay *schedules ticket* for x day at y time. *insurance plan* will help you if its related to the lines only if its anything else you will be responsible for time and labor charges




At this point I knew what the ticket would be and was feeling good, since for tickets that are needless and plain old harassment, as I disclosed to try to scare her out of it. But I knew most likely our installer would probably go out find nothing and waive the fee as a *courtesy check* at their discretion


Installer goes out, find no trouble. Close ticket.


**END SCENE 1**




&gt;**OP**: Hello IT

**BEGIN SCENE 2**

Less than 3 weeks have elapsed and I see her name pop on my screen with the usual trill of my desk phone. *sigh*


&gt;**frustrated customer**: PAGES ARE LOADING SLOWLY, there is SOMETHING wrong with YOUR LINES. Send someone out to fix them!


&gt;**OP** okay well let’s take a look at what’s going on


*enters the matrix of customer connection data* and unsurprisingly everything looks great. Better than the first time I looked at her connection. Her router has been up for 19 days (last time her and I were on the phone) and I want to do this quickly.


&gt;**OP** what trouble shooting steps have you done?


&gt;**frustrated customer**: everything that I need to know that. I need you to CHECK THE LINES!


&gt;**OP**: well I can’t “check the lines” without doing some troubleshooting, let’s start with your Dlink



DLink reboot ensues and customer is ever so unhappy. 



&gt;**OP**: are you able to connect? If you are able to that indicates something is wrong with you DLink or *the cable to it*.


&gt;**frustrated customer**: NO! The window went all gray and won’t respond when I click *incessant clicking*


&gt;**OP**: sounds like your computer is frozen or at least *internet browser*


&gt;**frustrated customer**: it’s not that. I telling you it’s the LINES



Rebooted her computer and that solved her issues and she chalked it up to “weird, I know it’s the lines” and once again demanded a ticket be placed again.



Installer goes out, find no trouble. Close ticket.


Unfortunately I was not graced with the privilege to speak with our beloved **frustrated customer** again but every few months I check up on her. She was so convinced it was the copper lines that we laid to her property she had this call 2 more times with two more call center techs.


Fast forward a couple months and she PAID BY THE FOOT for a special fiber drop to her house. Which can be $20-30 PER FOOT. And then USED THE SAME DLINK. More troubles followed for MONTHS no matter how many times we told her it has to be a LAN problem offered her solutions that were much cheaper and easier than is laying an undisclosed amount of money on a cable. Estimated between 8-15 grand! After she calls and harasses more coworkers she is finally convinced to at least replace the Ethernet cable to her DLink and poof! Like that! Callbacks stop happening.




TLDR: customer has as much money as stubbornness and spends many thousands just to have needed to replace a $7 Ethernet cord



Side note: she called and was angry again and told us it’s our fault when she had a power outlet go out and it shutoff her internet access and refused to believe it was her outlet (fiber ONTs have battery backup go into a phone only mode when they lose ac so subscriber can dial 911). This I would empathetic with her a bit if she hadn’t called multiple coworkers directly expletive’s and names over the matter.

"I just posted a story about tech support and I honestly remembered a recent story that happened a month ago. 

I work in IT and I was requested to contact support of a software company. Yep even the big ones have crazy support. 

I ordered a product for one of my staff and then I discovered that the staff wants to use multiplecof their products. The all in one package seems like a better choice and was more cost effective. Also the staff only wanted products from this brand and didn't like alternatives. So I wanted to upgrade and remove the single product.


Here is where the funny business happens

Support: ""hello may I help you sir""

Me: "" yes I want to upgrade my package. I want the annual subscription that covers everything. ""

Support: "" that is not possible. Only way to do it is to delete account and recreate it again.""

Me"" are you sure this is the only option? There are no alternatives""

Support: "" nope is the only way""

Me: "" okay do it. Then after that I will order the upgrade""

Support: ""okay it is done""

I loggin the website and try to order but I cannot order online anymore. I was confused, before I was able to choose the software and can select multiple at once now the option is not available I called support.

Support: "" may I help you"" 

Me: "" yes I was able to order online, now I can't for some reason. Can you fix the issue""

Support: "" you do not have any software or history under your account""

I retell what happened

Support: "" okay sir you want the upgrade. Can you please give me your credit card details""

Me: "" no I want to order online please. Can you please check what is the issue with account""

Support: "" it is not possible to order online. Only way is through telephone""

I was confused cause I literally ordered online so I knew it was a lie. Maybe the staff is just reading a script or something. 

Me: "" I actually ordered online before. Can you please transfer me to someone who knows more about the account""

Support : "" okay will transfer call to manager""

Support manager : "" hello sir, I got informed that you are not willing to give us your credit card information on the phone""

Me confused as fuck and scared that this is a scam but I know I only contacts support through official website but maybe telephone support are contractors or something.

Support : ""only way to order our product is using telephone or using local vendor"".

Me: "" local vendor it is"". 


Called vendor and things went smooth.

Backstory: I work at an A.A.S.P. ( Apple Authorised Service Provider) which is basically is a company which is allowed by Apple to repair Apple products under the 1 year Apple manufacture warranty and AppleCare. My company also has our own warranty which is a cabon copy of AppleCare without any accidental damage cover called CompanyCare in this story. This means we follow all of Apples warranty guidelines for repairs to devices. 

We mainly sell Apple products with our warranty to business and schools. CompanyCare doesn't cover any accidental damage to the covered devices.

The repairs team that I am part of only communicates with our customers via a ticket system so I was able to re-read the ticket for this post.

Just so everyone is aware Apple and AASP's only replace iPads things like screen replacements or battery repalcements are can't be done, I have tried to look for Apple service guides to take iPads apart but they don't exist and the only reason given is because Apple says so.

I have shortened the length of the interaction with the customer this entire this took nearly 2 months.

brackets are for my thoughts at the time as I remember them.

Square brackets are for contextual information.

Storytime:

So its the start of work and I'm checking the ticketing system for any tickets that came in after we closed yesterday. I see a new ticket from one of our client schools for an iPad (Somthing easy to start the day off with).

BT: Hey an iPad we bought less than 6 months ago has a cracked screen. The user had it in its case so this is not accidental damage, it must be defective. Image below.

The image showed a iPad with multiple cracks going across the whole screen. The cracks clearly originated from a section of the left had side of the screen where it was most likely dropped. (Well that's clearly accidental damage, does this guy think I'm stupid)

Me: Hi BT, from the image you sent me the iPad appears to have sustained accidental damage which is not covered by warranty. Please fill out the attached form so I can arrange collection of the device for replacement.\[ the form just asks for a pickup address, if the device has been backed up and a full description of the issue\]

A few hours later BT responds with the completed form. In the issue description section BT has written. ' screen cracked while device was being kept carefully in its case, device is defective not misused. ' This guy clearly wanted a free replacement but our company has a zero tolerance on free out of warranty repairs/replacements. Either the warranty covers the issue and the repair is free or the client has to pay for the repair or the repair doesn't happen. So my go to plan is to ignore his statement that the screen just cracked on its own and offer a quote for the repair.

Me: Since this will be a chargeable replacement would you like me to send you a quote for the replacement of the device. \[the replacement cost was around £200 while a new iPad of that model would cost £700\]

BT: Well, that's disputable. The user says that despite the iPad being in its case and being careful the screen cracked without an accidental incident. It is up to you and Apple to prove the device was not inherently defective in the initial 6 month per the Sale of Goods Act. This is not the time for the quotation as we believe the product failed without any accidental damage.

I rolled my eye's at this response but as I didn't want to get into an argument at the time so I arranged the collection of the device so that I could examine the device myself. I was hoping that they had damaged the screen previously and had a 3rd party company using 3rd party components to fix the issue so the warranty would be void\[ this is quite a common thing that happened\]. Also since I had only become fully qualified 3 months ago I wanted to cover all my bases before arguing with the client.

Me: BT, when the iPad arrives it will be thoroughly inspected using Apples latest service guides to confirm the eligibility of the device for warranty service.

BT: We will see about the Sale of Goods Act then depending on their findings. Have a great weekend. \[ he clearly didn't realise that I was a repair tech not some customer service guy\]

When the device arrived at the repair centre I performed a extremely detailed inspection of the iPad and made over a page of notes of the damage describing each of the cracks in detail and quoted the Apple visual inspection guidelines in relation to every aspect of the iPad condition \[ the display was not 3rd party\]. The damage was a bit more extensive the glass around the camera had broken off ant the camera was completely exposed. I spent about 3 hours documenting this but I wanted this to be dealt with as fast as possible and good notes would be the first step towards that, luckily we were having a slow week and my manager was happy for me to not have to deal with another attempt to get a free repair. With a S\*\*t eating grin I sent BT my findings.

Me: Hello BT, We have completed a thorough inspection of your 6th gen iPad inline with Apple's Visual Mechanical Inspection guidelines. This insection has revealed that the iPads display has sustained multiple cracks and chips to the glass which have exposed internal components of the device. This unfortunately makes the device ineligible for warranty service making the repair chargeable. Please see the attached quote.

Thinking that the guy would realise he was banging his head against a brick wall I felt quite satisfied and began working the new 2019 MacBook product qualifications. BT then kept coming back over the next few weeks asking questions about hoe the device was inspected and the and asking for specific definitions of the damage and eligibility criteria described in the service guide which we Apple doesn't allow us to disclose so I had to be intentionally vague about it which made him think I was trying to scam him. 

Eventually he responded with this.

BT: Apple will need to make the final call on weather this is a manufacturing defect. As this item is less than 6 months old Apple should be providing us with a report proving the device is not defective, so until evidence is provided it is not inherently defective I believe we are contractually entitled to s free replacement of the iPad.

This surprisingly pushed me over the edge and I didn't trust my self to respond to the arrogant son of a b\*\*ch. I completely disassembled the iMac I was using and then put it back together to calm myself, when my manager noticed what I was doing I said I was just practising on it.

Luckily we have a messaging system to get in contact with Apple's techs easily. I just sent them images of the iPad from several angles and requested a conformation of warranty eligibility. The Apple tech who I was in contact with told me to grow a spine and charge the customer for the replacement or send it back to them as I was wasting his time but he did confirm that the cracks were not a manufacturing fault. I agreed with him but our company policy is to get in contact with Apple when the customer requests it. I told myself  this would be my last attempt to get payment for the replacement device.

Me: Apple has reviewed the damage to the device and confirmed that the cracks in the display are not caused by any manufacturing process or materials used in construction of the device. Apple has confirmed that we can proceed with this as a out of warranty replacement. Please send over a purchase order for the replacement of the iPad or we will return the device to you as a unwanted out of warranty replacement. 

BT reponded quickly since if we put this down as a unwanted repair it would be passed on to the schools procurement team who would have questions.

BT: Sorry for all the back and forth but I need that paper trail to satisfy my manager. Purchase order to follow ASAP.

After that the PO came through and the iPad was replaced without further incident.

Later I found out that the school was known to haggle over any and all chargeable repairs, so at least I was not the only repair tech to suffer under them.",The screen just cracked on its own,0

"The beginning. 

The first office my friend was working in was going to get a computer. The postmaster was an older man. People saw him as a father figure, friend, fun loving nice guy. He was so computer illiterate, it wasn’t funny. This of course caused funny situations.

It was set up for him and was shown how to send and receive emails. At the time, that’s all it was used for. The postmaster would check for emails 3 times a day. The computer used a dial up modem. This caused issues for updates.

One day the postmaster received a phone call about updating the computer, he asked my friend about it. My friend told him to set it up Saturday night and let it go all weekend or forget it. The postmaster smile. Ok, I’ll forget it. 

There were several simple problems the postmaster asked my friend about. How to save, cut and paste, what happens if I dump a 40 oz soda in the back of this thing?  Things like that. 

Edit: when I said I would show him how to cut and paste, he took out a large pair of scissors. I told him those weren’t needed. He said darn, he really wanted to cut something off the computer 

My friend asked why he hated computers the way he did.  

The postmaster said, whenever he pushes the buttons, bad things happen. 

How bad?

The postmaster smiled and told this story. His friend wanted to email him, keep in contact. His friend wrote down instructions, step by step, how to use email. Even gave him a computer. The postmaster followed the instructions and a strange screen came up. He turned off the computer and didn’t touch it again. 

A couple weeks later, his friend asked why he hadn’t email him.  The postmaster explained what happened and the strange screen that appeared. His friend looked at him in disbelief, your not supposed to be able to get into that. It sounds like the main programming for the internet. Did you do anything on that page?  The postmaster smile, yeah, I didn’t like the way this side looked so I made a couple changes.  His friend yelled No!  You’re not supposed to . . . The postmaster stopped him and said he turned it off. I told you computers were bad for me. 

My friend smiled, it was also that postmaster that told others about my friend. And word travels fast. Before retiring, that postmaster said he would have stayed long if it wasn’t for that monstrosity on his desk. (Pointing at the computer)",Unofficial USPS IT guy - 4 repost,0
"So I worked in tech support for 6 months. I have fortunately quit that job. We provided tech support for a software that is used in call centers and tech support. This happened during an evening shift of mine, around 6-7 pm (it was 24x7 support).


So this client had an issue. We provided a short term solution, but it needed to be fixed with a patch update for a proper fix. Depending on the issue, we provide various patch updates. So in this case 4-5 patches needed to be updated. The size for them was around 1-2 GB. The patch update required atleast 1 hour downtime. But we asked clients for 2 as a buffer in case anything went wrong.


So what we did was, we uploaded  the patches on WeTransfer, where you upload files, it provides you with a link. Anyone can down the files by clicking on the link. The thing is, the link is valid for only 7 days.


So I am talking with this customer.

Me - C, so I am providing you with this link. You need to download the files through this link, and just copy them onto your server. Then we will update the patches on x date.


C: The update will be performed in morning time not evening time. So, that's not my job, that's the morning shift's job.

Me: (ugh) Fine, sir can you please tell your morning shift, to download and copy the files, otherwise we will not be able to do it.

C: I will do it.

The update was scheduled on x date. I provided the customer with the link 8-10 days before that.

Update day:

Person who will perform the activity (A): Sir where are the patch files?

Different person on client side (Cx): what files? We weren't provided with any files.

A: Sir, the link is on the ticket.

Cx: but I wasn't informed of it.

*A calls me over and asks me about this. I tell him I had informed C about this*

A: Sir, your coworker C was informed about it.

Cx: but why didn't you inform me, as I would be your PoC today.

A: we were also never informed who would be the PoC. Anyway let's download the files.

*A tries to download the file but the link has expired because 7 days have passed.*

A and Cx get into an argument again.


After a pretty useless argument, A downloads the patch files on his computer from our repository, then upload it to wetransfer, provide Cx with the link. Cx then downloads it on his system and then copy them on to the server.


A then finally updates all the patches on the system.


Overall the time taken was around 2-2.5 hours with 1-1.5 hours of downtime. Cx was fucking mad because we took so long and didn't provide the link beforehand (yes he said that). As if that wasn't enough, he then proceeded to write a feedback on the ticket itself about the same things. We had to explain everything to our department head.","That's not my job, that's morning shift's job",0
"First time poster, blah blah blah.

I work for an Internet/TV provider and manage, among other things, the TV backend and client software. Received a ticket from the inventory people saying that the set top boxes being tested (returned from customer, tested before being refurbished) have their front LEDs blinking non-stop, but otherwise seem okay, asking what to do. Confused, I make the trip to see it myself. Normally a continuous flashing LED means it's still booting so that doesn't make sense to me.

On arrival I see that the description is correct, but I misunderstood the meaning of blinking. The blinking was rapid, indicating that it's receiving continuous remote control signals. All our remote are IR-based (not radio) which should make finding the source straight-forward. I walk up to the bench confirm my hypothesis: putting my hand in front of the box stops the signal and removing it resumes the signal. So now I slowly use my whole body to try blocking the signal while also pulling up the camera app on my phone in case I need it.

Upon the flashing LEDs returning to solid (to the surprise of those working on the floor), I rotate 180 degrees and look at what's right in front of me... A large transparent plastic container full of remotes haphazardly placed within it sitting on a shelf. I don't even need my phone to find the exact culprit remote - it's the one on the bottom. The ticket creator is following me and, upon seeing the glowing buttons on the remote control, understands what is happening.

Ticket closed. Cleaning up the remotes is their problem.",The LED is blinking but it seems fine otherwise,0
"Yet another riveting (?) tale from my days as hospital IT.


This particular Friday was glacially slow, so I was almost relieved when the phone rang.  

&gt;Me: IT, This is Bacon

&gt;Caller: This is Angry Nurse. I’m calling because Edwin from IT promised me an update on my computer. He hasn’t called back and I’m unable to do my job until it’s fixed. Can you come to my office and fix it?

&gt;Me: Ma’m, we don’t have an Edwin that works here. Are you sure -

&gt;C: That’s not true, I spoke to him on Wednesday and he said he was going to fix it 

&gt;Me: We didn’t….  M’am, where are you calling from?

&gt;C: Red tower, 7West, of course.

*The elevator panels went to 8 (thanks, eBay spares) but we only had 4 floors. For a second, I thought she'd lost her mind. Then, I realized we had no red tower*

&gt;Me: Uh, what hospital are you calling from?

&gt;C: *Affiliate Hospital several hundred miles away*

&gt;Me: Oh, you’ve called $Hospital IT. I’m a LONG way from you

&gt;C: Oh...I’m sorry, didn’t mean to be rude, but my computer hasn’t worked right in weeks. Edwin keeps promising to fix it but nothing has helped so far. You’re probably the wrong person to help me. I feel bad for having bothered you.

This poor lady sounds totally defeated. I feel even worse for her because I'm going to have to ruin her day. I'll have tell her I can't help her. See, we were contractually PROHIBITED from providing IT support to all Affiliate Hospitals because reasons.

*EDIT: Let me pause to explain the quirks of my predicament. You see, our hospital had recently been bought out by $LargeHospitalChain and integrated into their network, but we were still using our own phone system. That meant I could easily remote to her PC, but unlike the folks at $CorporateHelpdesk, none of my calls were recorded. CorporateHQ was fanatical about policies and procedures, but at $Hospital, we’d been flying by the seat of our pants for years...*


I took a quick glance around. No one is in earshot. YOLO time.

&gt;Me: No worries. What seems to be the issue? I’ll try to help as much as I can.

&gt;C: I’m not sure you can fix it. They’ve already replaced my PC twice and said they might have to rebuild the server

&gt;Me: Server? What aren’t you able to do? What’s not working?

&gt;C: The incident reporting system. I can’t use it at all.



*For context, most hospitals have some kind of incident management software. They use it to document customer complaints, slip and falls, medication errors…it’s basically ticketing software for medical oopsies. They take it very seriously and run a lot of reports out of it.*


I’m chuckling inside. At first, I doubted if I could help her at all, but I was trained as the local guru on it. I’ve spent so much time with the incident reporting system that I almost know more about it than the admins at Corporate IT. I gotchu fam.

&gt;Me: OK, I know a fair bit about that. What error is it giving?

&gt;C: I’m not sure what it says, but they said it was unfixable

&gt;Me: Well, I’d like to take a look. It’s not like I could make it worse LOL. What’s your PC name?

&gt;C: PC12345 but I’m not sure what you could do to help

I remoted to her PC and had her show me what it was doing. Same dumb .NET error I fought every day, plus an INI file error from being uninstalled wrong in the past. Ten second fix, hopefully. Today I get to be someone’s hero.

So, I ran my .NET script, deleted the INI, and had her try it again. My hero status is in jeopardy...it’s still not working. Time for the hop-on-one-foot-and-bark dance that this hot garbage requires. Reset IE, disk cleanup, clear cookies, reboot PC, re-run the scripts that Corporate IT doesn’t know I have. If this doesn't fix it, I got nothing.

Ritual dance complete, we try it again.

&gt;C: Oh my god, it works! I don’t know what you did but you have no idea how grateful I am. I’ve not been able to do incident audits for a couple of weeks and my boss has really been p!ssed. Thank you so much!
 
&gt;Me: No worries, glad I could be of assistance! I hope you enjoy your weekend. Bye!

"This could also fall under idontworkhere or notmyjob. My friend was asked to help set up a new computer in a post office. He was sitting at a desk about 6 feet behind the counter. After unboxing the computer. He was hooking cords when he heard someone clear her throat. Looking up, a woman was looking at him. The postmaster was busy helping someone else but intervened. He here for the computer, I can help you in a second. 

She turned, I need this sent out. 

Like I said, I’ll help you in a second. I just have to help him first (motioning to the man in front of her)

The man walked out, the woman sent out her package and the postmaster apologized. Told him he just needs to set it up, update, and he’s done. 

The setup was easy, the update would take time. And he sat in a chair waiting. After a little while, the postmaster said she needed to grab the mail from the blue box outside the door. There hadn’t been anyone in a where so she figured it would be a good time. 

There were 2 way to enter the building. It seemed as the postmaster walked out 1 door. A woman walked in the other. She walked up to the counter. Impatiently cleared her throat and glared at my friend. 

Sorry, she’ll be right in to help you. 

I saw her outside. Why don’t you help me? (So much attitude)

I can’t. I’m just here to hook up the computer.

You work here. You’re wearing a post office ID.( hanging from his shirt)

That’s to prove I’m allowed to be back here. I don’t have access to those computers, to sell you things. (Pointing to the computers at the counter)

Well, I need stamps

Do you have the login code for those computers?(he has no idea if he needed login code or not)

No

Well neither do I. So you are going to have to wait.  Seconds later the postmaster walked up to help her. 

After she left my friend asked if it was him or was everyone obnoxious. She just smiled, try being here all day. Shortly after, the computer was done and he went home.

" 

I know I should not blame this person for the situation she's in.  And I should blame Tier 2 for this even getting to us.

I  support enterprise ""Unified Messaging""/phone/IM/conferencing software  products, for the publisher of the products, delivering service to its  internal staff.

The problem  statement:  User loses audio when she joins $product meeting.  This  sounds like a fairly simple problem, that rarely would make it to Tier  3.  Inside ticket history, I find the prior problem statement:  ""Phone  Audio"" feature does not prompt to enter phone number in the meeting.   That one is completely useless, except insofar as it tells me that the  current problem statement is out of whack by several orders of  magnitude.

T2 says she is running  the product in a virtual machine -- but they don't say whether it's a VM  locally running on her PC (supported) or a VM running on another PC but  in the same building she's in (best effort only), or if she's using VPN  to remote into a VM running on a server that has its own hardware  abstraction layer. (Supported?  What you been smokin'?)

They  don't say why she's running a VM.  They asked her a lot of questions  that were too complicated for an ordinary user to understand, and it's  clear T2 didn't understand the questions either or they'd have realized  her answers made no sense.

She's  not ""available"" in IM so I keep reading.  Audio works when she's the  first person to join a meeting.  IF she's not the first to join, audio  does not work.  However, in the latter case, if she's the only one  remaining after all others have quit, audio starts working again.

My  head is spinning at this point.   The VM is abstracted from the  hardware of the server.  If she's dialing in remotely, RDP has its own  abstraction layer.  And what's this about using her cellphone as a  speakerphone?

I get in contact  with the user and start asking questions.  Gradually I tease out what's  really going on.  She's not using a VM.  She's remoting via RDP to a  desktop in her office that runs the product client.  When she joins the  meeting, she uses a feature that routes the audio through her cellphone.   it's not that ""audio doesnt work"", it's that when she's not the first  to join, the option to call out never appears.  She can't do her  presentation because she has no audio.

Why  can't she run the product's Android client?  Her cellphone is a Samsung  S3 running KitKat 4.4.  The security software we use will barely run,  let alone client software.

Why  can't she run the product client on her remote laptop?  It's a 2010  workstation-class laptop (Nvidia Quattro) with Windows 7 on it.  When  she runs the client, her laptop crashes and (she says) has to be  reimaged.  Every time she's tried.

The  PC she's connecting to is running Windows 10 at least.  It's a 2014-era  Dell Precision running Windows 10 -- but the on-board audio doesn't  work.

Which is why she has been  using the conferencing system to route audio to her cellphone.  She can  present her powerpoint slides and use her Android 4.4 phone as a  speakerphone.

I ask her ""Have you  tried just dialing in to the conference call with your phone, and  presenting with the remote workstation?""  Her answer:  I'm not sure what  you mean.  ""I mean, dial the conferencing center's telephone number and  enter in the conference ID"".  Her:  I told you I can't run the  telephony client on the phone.

Me: Trying to figure out how to pronounce ""0.o""

Me:  Your phone has a dial pad, right?

Her: Yes.

Me: . . .

Her: . . .

Me: . . .

Her: You mean I could call the conferencing center using my phone?  Will that work?

Me: Fighting the urge to say something snarky. &lt;ahem&gt; "" Y e s ""

Her: . . .   Oh! Oh wait! I get it!  That's BRILLIANT! Thank you SO MUCH.

Me:  So aside from that, what you should do is print out this chat log and  take it to your manager.  I'm pretty solid sure that this conversation  is your business case for getting a new laptop.

This  company generally keeps its staff updated with recent hardware, and has  a two-year refresh cycle.  I'm a contractor, and I've got a Precision  3520 -- not state of the art, but it's got a USB C Thunderbolt port, 16  gigs and an I7.  I do in fact play games on it when I'm WFH or alone in  the office.

I know exactly how  this person got to be where she's at:  FNG gets the scrounged gear.  Manager holds back on spending anything until s/he notices that the FNG  isn't complaining about her crappy 5, 6 and 9 year old equipment.   Ingenious-if-a-bit-thick user figures out how to get her job done with  these ancient relics.  Eventually she forgets that it was an abomination  of a workflow and now can't remember what it was like to have the right  tool for the job.

I'm not sure what you mean.

"Hi all,

Me again. I usually post my most surreal story on Fridays.

Backstory: I am one of only two IT personnel at a dozen+ building facility with over 1,000 endpoints. Naturally, they smash every IT position into one role. This leads into some.. interesting interactions.

Most surreal of this week (it was hard just picking one):

This will be a quick one.

User catches me in the hall, saying ""you have to look at my computer, my boss said she sent me an important email but I never got it. Ever since you guys did network changes it's been doing this"".

This is the same person that, 6 months ago, told me with a straight face, ""I don't believe in e-mails. If something important happens, I'll know.""

Go to user's area. She stands up and motions me to have a seat at her computer. She's logged in with her profile and everything.

First thing I see is an Internet Explorer window with a search that says ""help how do I open email"". This woman has been in her position two decades.

I go through [virtualization solution] to access her email, making sure she takes notes. Of course her email is at quota and full. Judging by email content, she hasn't logged in since about 2015.

I then proceed to take around 45 minutes to help her clean out her email inbox, have her boss re-send the ""important email"" (because it bounced).","""I don't believe in email.""",0

ADDITIONAL TRIGGER WARNING : This is a long post.  That's partly because I feel it's the best way to convey the essential nuance of the story, but also because I had to go through this sh*t in real time, and you lot don't deserve much better.


Introducing characters as they appear seemed to work OK last time, so I'll do it that way again.  Buckle up.

Many years back I worked for XYZ Inc.  They made specialist (and expensive) production machines for a particular type of industry.  This story takes place a few years after the start of my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cq42fp/no_my_private_number_isnt_the_24hour_helpline_for/), and XYZ Inc.'s biggest job in hand was fitting out a new manufacturing plant for a particular customer, we'll call them ABC Corp.  To give a flavour of the scope here, just phase1 of this factory took eighteen months of work after the order was placed and XYZ Inc.'s direct billing ran well into 8 figures, and we also specified for ABC Corp. to buy a similar value of other manufacturer's machinery so that it could work directly with ours.  There was over a half a million in conveyor belts alone.

You might think that meant we were in charge of the whole thing, but we weren't.  ABC Corp. wanted to keep control and 'economise' by using their own people where possible, so they ran it themselves, and as well as being the customer they acted as project managers and liason between the architects, builders, machinery and plant suppliers, fitting trades, etc.etc.  Not a problem as far as we at XYZ Inc. were concerned.  We sold the job to a specification, we wrote the contract to define that specification, and we will have no problem delivering on all the promises made therein.  EXACTLY as promised.

Oh, but if you want to change that specification after the fact, there'll be a bill for doing it.  As far as we're concerned, 'feature creep' means Uncle Fester.  And if we're working away and then unexpectly find that whatever it is of yours we need to connect to, incorporate or work around isn't ready on schedule, isn't to spec, or is some new and exciting spec we didn't agree to, progress will stop and you'll get an even bigger bill.  And the definition of 'yours' is anything we don't supply, because you're managing this sh*tshow, not us.

Did i mention the project manager?  ABC Corp.'s pick for this role was the talent they'd already recruited to be plant manager at the new factory when the place started running.  Makes sense, you'd think - who else could possibly be more motivated to make their own life easier by delivering the best built, most efficient new factory imaginable?  And having done that, who would then also be an in-house expert on every part of the facility able to trouble shoot production issues as soon as they came up?  Well, I don't know what guidance ABC Corp. had given the recruitment agent into the kind of person they wanted, but it must have made fascinating reading.  In the collective opinion of XYZ Inc.'s people on the ground, the individual selected for this prestigious role had precisely two skills ;
1)  Shouting; and,
2)  Lying.
And frankly they weren't much good at the second one.

But I digress.

Part of this job was a factory data collection and analysis system.  All the machines in the building had at least some level of on-board intelligence, and every single one was going to have an ethernet connection to a data collection server.  That server would monitor what happened throughout the factory second-by-second and then produce a range of standard and custom reports.  Not a cheap option to add on a factory of this size, but numbers never lie.  So if you've got good people looking at those numbers, an system like this that never misses the detail can be an amazing tool to keep that place running efficiently, and spot future issues while they're still small.  F*ck knows what ABC Corp. thought ProjectManager was going to do with it.

Part of the deal with this thing was that XYZ Inc. also got to see the data.  That way we can learn from it and incorporates those lessons in our next generation of machines to make them better.  And if ABC Corp. felt they had some complaint about our product, the data system was there to tell the whole unvarnished story as to whether they were right or wrong.  To do this, the XYZ Inc. supplied data server rack that the ethernet lines all connected to also needed an ISDN line.  (If you've not heard of ISDN before, no worries, it's basically a dedicated phone line optimised for data - there's plenty more Nerdspeak in the detail obviously, but that's all we need for story purposes.)

You'll remember XYZ Inc. weren't in charge of the entire project, and the ISDN line counted as being part of the building, so it's something that ABC Corp. had to arrange themselves.  And like everything else, it has a specification, a location (in the phase1 server room where we been told to install the data server rack), and a due date.

Sorry, I gotta go back and whine about ABC Corp.'s personel again.  I've already told you about their new plant management hire.  Obviously, in that case, ABC Corp. was seeking someone really special to bring the new factory on line with a bang (I know they succeeded, I heard the thud from here), and they had the budget to match.  Unfortunately they hadn't been able to be quite so picky in the hiring management at their existing local plant.  Oh, and the place was also a hotbed of nepotism.  'Working from home without leave' was also rife.

So some of the existing employees, in particular those who seemed destined to spend the rest of eternity in lower or middle management, were just awe inspiring in their apparent in ability to do any work more challenging than holding down the floor.  IT was 'run' by one such an individual, who also had a truly jaw-dropping lack of self-awareness.  Department second in command was pretty much a carbon copy, as was the one other tech I personally dealt with.  If there was any qualification test at all to work there, I can only assume its main feature was the ability to recognise a PC without being prompted.  Extra points and earmarked for fast-track promotion if you knew that a laptop is 'better'.

Of course it's unfair to characterise the capabilities of an entire department - there were about six or seven ITfolks in total - based on just the head honcho, deputy and chief tech.  I only visited the actual IT office a couple of times, and I'm not sure they were all sentient at the time, so maybe just to draw a veil over it and hope for the best.

Anyway, ABC Corp's occasionally present local IT manager, hencefore known as F\*ckwittAboutTown, as well as being somebody's offspring, was put in charge of all IT infrastructure etc. at the new factory.  And if all goes well they're lined up for the cushy job of heading the IT department at the shiny new place.  On the subject of 'things going well', so many things have already been totally f\*cked up that AboutTown has by now been given specific written instructions to do/check EVERY single thing personally.

So arranging the ISDN line is their job.  One of my many many jobs is to chase them up on it.  Repeatedly.

We're about a year into the project by this stage, so I know what I'm facing.  I've simply scheduled myself to call F\*ckwittAboutTown every Tuesday and Thursday to check the current status of each individual item on the ever-growing laundry list of IT failure.  Take notes for the project documentation and my colleagues, and pass details of anything new that is wrong/overdue (Or, even more spectacularly wrong and overdue than last time) onto those responsible for billing ABC Corp.

About two weeks after the due date for the ISDN line I'm told it's done, and I can tick it off my list.  I will admit to being quite surprised.  About a week later I even get a phone number for it.

I pass this startling but welcome news onto the XYZ Inc. subsidiary building the data server rack.  (I'll call them XYZData from now on)  And those doubting Thomases ask me to check if it's really true!  They even want me to plug something in at the ABC Corp. end so they can test the data capabilities of their new toy.  How could anyone be so untrusting?

As it happens, I wasn't planning to be on site for a couple of weeks (I still had other work apart from this project), so I call in a favour and ask one of the XYZ Inc. techs commissioning some of our other gear to take a few minutes and go up to the phase1 server room and do the necessary for our offsite guys at XYZData.  I pass on the nice clear directions I've been given - the ISDN socket is on the waist-height trunking in the server room, right where the XYZ Inc. rack is supposed to go, and is labelled with both its function and the phone number - and leave the tech to organise with the XYZData what time/day best suits them both.

A couple of days later I get a call from our tech to tell me that the test was a bust.  They couldn't find the ISDN socket in the advertised location.  Or anywhere else.  It's not even a big room, and as yet had basically no equipment in it.

I thank our tech for their wasted lunch break and call F\*ckwittAboutTown.  I explain the apparent absence of the ISDN line and the time we've lost by our inability to check its functionality with surpassing patience.  F\*ckwittAboutTown assures me that the line is in, tested, and they have done this personally.  I express minor reservations as to the strict accuracy of these assertions.  After some discussion I persuade the esteemed head of ABC Corp.'s IT department to meet with our tech at the server room.  So they can personally show an XYZ Inc. staff member where the blasted thing is.

A week goes by, and the F*ckwittAboutTown has mysteriously blown off two meetings with the XYZ Inc. tech.  A couple of days later I ring ABC Corp. IT Department.

""Hi F*ckwittAboutTown, just a courtesy call to remind you that you were due to meet with our commissioning tech in the new factory server room five minutes ago.""

'Yeah, they cancelled on me, some urgent problem with one of your machines.'

""Really?  They're standing in the server room waiting for you now.""

'You sure?'

""I'm standing next to them.  We'll see you in ten minutes.""

About fifteen minutes later (there was a cross town drive involved) F\*ckwittAboutTown arrives to join XYZ Inc. Tech and I.  A brief discussion and some pointing at walls ensues, but the ISDN connection remains frustratingly absent.  Then, and only then, F\*ckwittAboutTown plays their get-out-of-jail-free card.

They have an invoice.  An invoice from a phone company no less.  And on this invoice are charges for the installation of an ISDN line at the new factory.   Billed to ABC Corp. and signed for by F\*ckwittAboutTown.  There is the minor detail that the order was placed after they was told me the thing was already done and tested, but fair's fair, a solid two out of ten for effort.

The XYZ Inc. Tech and I exchange a silent glance and agree that the receipt is likely genuine, forging such a thing not being in AboutTown's known skillset.  Motive and opportunity are definitely there, but means is lacking, and probably always will be.

AboutTown then reasonably explains that having paid the invoice they didn't bother to check the work in any way, and just said that they had, because it was obviously all going to be fine.  The tension leaves their body and they bask in the satisfaction of job well done.

It's now my turn to explain a few things, not least of which is that, despite F*ckwittAboutTown having ordered the thing on ABC Corp.'s account, there isn't any trace of it whatsoever.  AboutTown has literally nothing to show for having spent their employer's money.  The server rack will still therefore need a connection to what I'm now refering to as the 'real world', that place on the other side of the factory fence, ideally using a telecoms line of the contractually specified type.  It was at about this point that the XYZ Inc. commissioning tech decided they needed to go outside for some fresh air.

About a week of non-progress later, I am summoned to ProjectManager's office to explain the bill that had resulted from these shenanigans, and the upshot of that conversation was that as far as the ISDN line was concerned, I was to ""fix it"" so that XYZData were happy and ABC Corp. weren't in breach of contract.  F*ckwittAboutTown was relieved of this particular responsibility, and I was given authority to do the job with ABC Corp.'s money.  Lucky me.

Well I had an invoice for work allegedly done.  I had a phone number.  And if you tried connecting to that number using suitable hardware it seemed as though it was a real line but with no hardwire on the other end.

So I rang the phone company's tech support, explaining the situation and my new-found authority.  An appointment was duly arranged for a PhoneCompany technician to come on-site and investigate.  A couple of days later, I got a phone call from the technician who'd been allocated the job.  Personal service, I like that.  They were cancelling the appointment and it was a courtesy call to let me know.

""Why?"", I asked.

'So you don't waste time waiting for me when I'm not coming.'

""No, why are you cancelling the appointment?""

PhoneCompanyTech then explained that they'd prepared for the visit in advance by testing the line (all OK) and looking up its specs.  And from the exchange boxes it was listed as being routed from, they could tell there was no way it could be connected to the building they were meeting me in.  Not even the same part of town.  So I explained that I was holding paperwork which indicated quite clearly that ABC Corp. had paid for the connection to be in that very building, and that they even had a receipt saying it now was.

PhoneCompanyTech generously agreed that this was something of an issue, so instead of just closing the ticket, they referred it inwards and upwards to some higher level PhoneCompany tech department, and gave me the relevant numbers and contact details.

It took a couple more days to get the whole story.  Apparently, the phone tech assigned the installation job had been unable to find the new factory site for some reason.  I don't know why, they had the address, other phone lines had been installed on the same site by the same company, multiple delivery trucks from half a dozen vendors had come directly to site without difficulty after journeys of up to a thousand miles.  I mean it was the biggest construction site in town, the main building was the size of a football pitch.  I dunno, maybe they just weren't from this planet.

Anyway, having failed to find the job site, they did what any reasonable person would do in the circumstances.  Chose a random phone exchange box somewhere in the local area and ran an ISDN line from that into a convenient nearby building.  Tick off the job as complete and move on to the next one.  Actually I'm pretty d*mn sure they weren't from this planet.  PhoneCompany's super-techs were at least as dumb-founded by this as I was.

Let me say that again just in case it didn't sink in.  PhoneCompany took ABC Corp.'s order for an additional telecoms facility, and their money, and in response, PhoneCompany's staff member broke into someone else's building in a different part of town and installed a phone line without the owner's consent.

I have, to this a day, a mental picture of a British copper collaring a criminal with the immortal line ""I'm arresting you on suspicion of installing a phone line without consent, you do not have to say anything, but anything you do say may be taken down and used in evidence against you.  If you'll just step this way...""  It just won't go away, it's still there when I shut my eyes.

So we discussed ABC Corp.'s options.  What I wanted was the line disconnected from wherever it was, and reconnected in the server room at ABC Corp.'s new factory.  Don't care if it's the same number or gets a new one.  Sadly that wasn't an option.  At least disconnection wasn't.  That needed additional permissions.

""But ABC Corp. are paying for the line, and they've given me authority on this?  I can fax that through again.""

'Yeah, we accept that, but it's not in their building, and we need the building owner's consent to remove a data line.'

""Which building is it?  Where?  The line isn't supposed to be there anyway, surely we can just tell them.""

'Oh we can't tell you where the connection is if it's not on ABC Corp.'s site.  That'd be a breach of customer confidentiality.'

""Do they know they have an ISDN line?""

'Probably not.'

""So tell them about it and ask for permission to remove it.""

'Oh no, we can't do that, it's against PhoneCompany policy to recommend that a customer disconnects a billable service.'

""But the service is unused, and the bills for it go to ABC Corp.  Who are prepared to pay for an ISDN line going to the right place that they can actually use.""

'Rules are rules.  We aren't allowed to do that and we can't tell you where the line is connected either.'

In the end, I bowed to the inevitable and ordered a new ISDN line for the new factory using ABC Corp.'s money.  I also recommended that they stop paying bills on the original one and demand a refund on the installation, but I've no idea if anyone ever took notice of that.  Did this particular debacle affect F*ckwittAboutTown's chances of getting the cushy new job?  Probably not, they were likely still seen as the best of the available internal candidates, and all they'd ever done here was claim to have personally tested something that didn't actually exist.  Barely worth mentioning in the wacky world of ABC Corp. 

The End.

You thought I'd forgotten that special appearance by the server rack didn't you.

A couple of weeks later the data server rack arrived from XYZData.  The new factory was laid out like a lot of big modern plants - production machines in great caverous halls with plenty of room to swing a forklift, a three storey office block tucked away on one side for the ancilliary departments, and production offices and the like spread around the machinery halls, as near possible to what they controlled.  So the server room was on a mezzanine floor attached to the wall between material processing and phase1 production.

At this point I need to introduce SiteManager.  Because of the way this place was being built in phases, with facilities and machinery being installed as soon as their part of the building was done, ABC Corp. had had to contract an OHS specialist to control the site for them.  SiteManager had no interest in whether the factory worked to spec. or even ever produced anything at all.  Their job was to make sure that the commissioning techs weren't run over by a forklift driver who'd just be blinded by someone welding steelwork.  Or similar. And when phase1 started operations, to make sure that those were kept separate from contruction, installation and commissioning of phases 2 and 3.

If you wanted to do something, anything, on site, you needed SiteManager's say-so.  If whatever it was was your speciality or had been done before, then it was simply a question making sure you had clear space to work in (kind of like air traffic keeping planes apart in the sky).  If you want to do something new, SiteManager will be checking your plan versus OHS rules to make sure they're happy.  SiteManager's word on this is FINAL.  SiteManager was great to deal with and knew their stuff.  And they were insured up to the hilt.

So I drop a line to SiteManager saying this thing has arrived, where to find it, and could they have a forklift put it up on the mezzanine please.  No hurry, any time this week will be fine.  Thanks.

A couple of days later I get an email back saying the server rack is now on the right floor, but SiteManager can see a potential problem.  They'll be happy to show me the cause of their concern next time I'm on site.

So I thank them again and arrange to meet.  Standing next to server rack on the mezzanine landing outside the server room, the problem is obvious.  The rack won't go through the server room door, it's too tall.  The rack is a standard 19inch job.  They do come in various heights, but this one is what we'd been expecting, just under two metres, six foot and a couple of inches (I don't remember the exact number).  Close inspection of the door, on the other hand, shows that it's quite a bit shorter than normal.  Most people can walk through it without stooping, but not all.  There's no apparent reason for this, the ceiling on both sides of the wall is a good twelve feet (say four metres) up.  It smells distinctly like a ProjectManager special.

So I give XYZData a call.  Once I've persuaded them that it isn't April Fools, they agree that it'll be OK to tip the server rack over on its back, roll it through the door on a trolley, and stand it up again.  Just check all the screws and connections look solid before doing it.

Unfortunately SiteManager doesn't like this.  We can maybe use the forklift to put the thing back down at ground level, lie it down there and then lift it back up to the mezzanine again, but once it's through the doorway there's no way the forklift, or any other mechanical handling gear can reach in there to stand it up again.  And it weighs too much for SiteManager to allow one or even two people to do it by hand.

Either the doorway has to change, the server be put somewhere else (NOT happening), or we're going to have to put some mechanical handling gear up on the mezzanine to do the job.  And that equipment not only has to be able to be lifted up there by the forklift, it also has to be able to fit through the problem doorway.  There isn't anything suitable currently in use on site, so it'll need to be hired in specially.  And when the equipment hire company were told that the first thing we planned going to do with their kit was load it on a forklift and put it on a mezzanine that presently lacked guard rails, they immediately added extra insurance.  Combined total is just into four figures.  To move a server rack through a doorway into the room it was designed for.

Time to present ProjectManager with the options.  Rebuilding the doorway so that standard issue server racks and moderately tall people can get in and out of the server room without being scalped strikes both SiteManager and I as best, but it's not our decision.

Now, before you ask, it had been suggested that the pre-wired and fully tested rack could be disassembled, carried through the doorway in pieces and put back together again.  But the XYZData weren't very pro anyone, even from another subsidiary, messing with the hardware they'd supplied.  And our commissioning techs on site weren't exactly short of their own work to do either.  Also, ABC Corp. didn't want to pay the bill for the extra labour to actually do this.

Then ProjectManager announced that ABC Corp.'s IT department would do the disassembly/reassembly, at only modest cost to XYZ Inc.  I think it was while I was declining this kind offer that the XYZ Inc. Tech (the same one who'd previously looked for the ISDN line with me) experienced straight face retention issues and had to leave the building for further supplies of fresh air.

Cue a rant from ProjectManager about how ridiculous it was that they were constantly being forced to change their project decisions by XYZ Inc.  And when we weren't doing that we handing out bills for stuff of theirs we were changing for them.  Didn't us peasants understand that ProjectManager was in charge?

With hindsight I think I'll now have to admit that it is just possible that ""Why not try getting something right for a f*cking change,"" was maybe not the most helpful thing to say at this point.

Whatever.  It was duly decreed from on high (ProjectManager) that the doorway would not change, temporarily or otherwise, and the server rack would just have to get in the room somehow.

Well the contract says the data server should be in the nice air-conditioned server room.  So does common sense.  And if the door can't be made to fit, we'll have to go with SiteManager's plan.  I give them a heads up.  

""No problem,"" says SiteManager, and agrees to make preliminary arrangements.  Obviously to confirm the booking(s) they'll need to know who's picking up the tab for this.  Will it be XYZ Inc.?   No.

We wrote the contract remember.  And the data-collection system has its own section in there.  By a curious coincidence, in addition to saying what it does, and the connections and power feeds it needs, that section just happens to define the size and weight of the equipment XYZData would be supplying, and the minimum height and width of the path required to get it from the loading dock to the server room.  Path to be kept clear for the lifetime of the factory, just in case XYZ Inc. need to swap the rack for another one sometime down the line.  We liked writing stuff down.  We were good at that sh*t.

*""What do you want?'""*

""Just a bit of paperwork, ProjectManager.  This is a change note for ABC Corp. to confirm the alteration to contract spec with the smaller server room door.   Sign here.""

&lt; FX : scratchy pen noises &gt; 

""And this is the purchase order instructing SiteManager to hire in equipment and people to move the XYZData rack through the revised door horizontally and then stand it up again in compliance with OHS.  At ABC Corp.'s expense.""

""Sign here and here.""

Kicker :  The forklift and other equipment doing the job was going to wind up in just about everybody's way for a couple of hours, as well as not be being available for other work.  So the move was scheduled to actually happen late one Friday night when most crews were long gone.  Now I'm not insinuating anything, but the rack could actually have been tipped over and carried through the door fairly easily by say four or five people, even if OHS didn't like it.  And a thousand split four ways is more than decent beer money for the rest of the weekend.

"So, I work with home security systems. Like any modern smart devices, our equipment sometimes requires updates to the software so our customers can avoid known issues as we discover and patch them out. One of the cool little features our equipment has is that when it updates, it does so in the background until it needs to reboot to install the new software. This reboot normally takes a few minutes to complete and most customers won't even notice as the system returns to it's last armed or disarmed state. During those few minutes the system is rebooting, it is basically inactive. This customer had just so happened to be coming home during those minutes and then called us to complain that her home was ""completely unprotected for the entire time I was away, anybody could have broken in and you wouldn't know!"" I look at the system history and explain to her that according to our records, the entire process from when it started to when she called us to complain and then disarm it was less than 8 minutes. She says that I'm obviously incompetent and don't know what I'm talking about and demands that I pass her complaints to my manager as she feels this is unacceptable and that her home could've been broken into. In broad daylight. Within less than 8 minutes. With interior motion detectors that even if somebody had the perfect timing to get in during the reboot, would have detected them once inside and sounded the alarm. She then demands to be CC'd on this internal email chain, which I inform her I cannot do for company policy, but I still offer to email her separately afterward to let her know her feedback was passed along. She then yells at me and says that I can and will CC her and that she works in IT so she knows how it works and hangs up. I keep my word and email her complaints as best as I can without laughing and still keep my promise to email her afterward. She then emails me back that I did it wrong, and demands my supervisor and my area managers names. Due once more to company policy, I cannot disclose any information about other employees and was advised by another sup to just not bother replying and let her call back if she really feels a need to. I really do try not to revel in the unhappiness of unpleasant customers, but on rare occasions like this, I just can't help the smile on my face imagining what her next irate call will sound like.","""Yes, Ma'am, I'll let my supervisor know how our 8 minute software update put your entire family at risk.""",0
"This came up last week but only thought about writing it here tonight. Long time lurker, infrequent poster (around 75% of my ""stories"" would be devs being nonsensical).

I've recently begun an internship in a moderately big business group of my region, with my job being to use Python to develop process-facilitating tools. Sort of important note: I'm normally closer to a sysadmin than to a dev.

It's the beginning of the month of August, and us three interns are making good progress on our respective tools (in a nutshell, they're making APIs, I'm making the software to use them). Boss asks us to try testing in something that would be closer to prod than our current testing/development environment, so I spin up a basic virtual machine with as close a configuration as I can get to the actual production environment. So basically around 1/8th of its power. But at least the OS is right, so we'll all take it.

All the apps are put on the server through the arcane magic of git, only thing missing is the database. Boss gives us a truncated backup of the production DB, it's nothing but your average SQL file, what could go wrong right ? So I go ahead and import the file. Except it doesn't import and spits out a syntax error on line 1.

At this point, I'm cursing in various different languages simultaneously, because the MySQL shell reports an error on an SQL command that isn't anywhere near close to line 1 (and in fact occurs several times in the file, with a few of the occurences having a line number in the lower five digits long). To not help matters further, MySQL only says there is a syntax error; not *which* syntax error, and only some vague hints about where to look (other than line ""1""). The script, in the meantime, is thoroughly checked by our local SQL shaman, to no avail. There is no logical reason the script would fail, especially with a syntax error.

I go have a smoke, during which I am enlightened. Figuratively and literally, as the summer sun seems to have made the ambitious plan of melting both my flesh and my retinas today. Once I come back inside, after letting my eyes adjust to the (absence of) lighting of the abode of the IT dept, I wrest control of my machine from the other interns (who at this point in time are considering a blood sacrifice -- a practice that I clarify to them is only to be used for printers), stare into the soul of my VM, and cast an elementary cantrip that I don't think to use often enough: `df -h`.

Lo and behold, root is full at roughly 98%. The fragment of the database, while being a fragment, was too big to fit in the remaining space. Not really wanting to cherry pick which part of the system lives and dies, I decide to merely resize the virtual disk image. Only to have *that* fail too.

...I don't really have a climactic end to this tale. To tell you the truth I declared that I solved enough weird [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] for one day, gave up and recreated the VM from the ground up, with twice as much disk space than we originally estimated. The SQL file worked instantly, and in a weird twist, the painful part was rebuilding the running environment of our respective programs rather than anything SQL related we did for the remainder of that day.

And I still don't know why would MySQL report a syntax error when it was absolutely not a syntax error.",The little VM that couldn't (and some SQL on the side),0
"I had posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cqegq7/ultra_rude_clients/) as a comment and was told I should post it as a full story.  So I'm pasting it here and will try to add some details.

Previously I worked for a Print/Copy/Shipping company, I was there nearly 2 decades from front line employee eventually ending as local IT.  This is a tale from when I was an Assistant Manager of a location but asked to assist with an IT rollout.  I had a District Manager who loved me, he liked how I was with customers and my problem solving skills.  I also had a Regional Tech who knew I was computer literate.  It was summer many years ago, maybe early 2000's, which was the slowest time of the year for my location  I was asked to help roll out a major software upgrade. This upgrade was a complete re-image of the primary and any secondary production computers. Computers that processed the print jobs that was the bread and butter of the company.  This was given to two Assistant Managers who were at slow stores, as the corporate provided instructions were out of order, missing information or outright incorrect.  I literally crossed out whole pages of instructions and wrote new steps in some places.  We had a special training session to ""update"" the instructions so we could properly image and set up the computers.  If I remember correctly this was an upgrade from Win98 to XP along with a major update to how jobs were processed.

There were a few pre-requisites:

* All customer files need to be backed up (The ghost image literally would wipe all of the drives to set up a local retention drive)

* I needed access to the server (I don't recall why, it was a small patch we had to run on the local server)

* There should be a list of all printers with their IP addresses (Each location would have 4-6 printers)

The install took 3-4 hours on the primary machine (restoring the data) and 2-3 on the secondary machines. You had to have the primary machine at least complete with the imaging before you could start a secondary.

These visits were scheduled over the course of a few weeks.  I would do a couple of store visits, then work at my normal store the rest of the week.  I think I had something like 9 stores to do.  I'd show up at 7 or 8am at a store, verify the pre-requisites were done, then commence the install.

This all goes good for a couple of weeks, I'm at my last install. It's a Friday, I'm due back at my store on Monday. I walk in at 7am and nobody knows why I'm there. I go to the primary computer and there's a note from one of the assistant managers that the backup was left running overnight.  Of course it wasn't completed, they were burning CDs of the data rather than use the built in mini tape drive.  On top of that there's no printer information. I get a call from the assistant manager who was doing all of this and he told me that it was last minute because he found out from the manager the night before.

This was a medium sized store so I only had 2 computers to image.  So  I finished the backup while going around and getting the printer info. That was about 45 minutes of work, not too bad. I go to the server room and it's locked, have someone get the keys from the lockbox, and of course there's no key.  So the store starts calling the manager and he isn't answering his phone and I know the managers are supposed to meet with the District Manager that day for a meeting.

I called the Regional Tech and she told me to call the DM, tell him what happened and I could wait if I wanted to or I could walk out and get paid for the day.  I call the District Manager and leave a message for him letting him know what was going on.  The manager finally calls and says he has the key but it'll be an hour to an hour and a half for him to get to the store. He then tried to argue that he didn't have enough notice that this was happening.  The managers were literally told a month in advance and I emailed each store I was scheduled for on Sunday with my schedule for the week. I called the DM back and he picked up from his car.  I let him know what happened since he hadn't had a chance to listen to my voicemail, how the Regional Tech said I could leave and get paid since the instructions weren't followed and my conversation with the manager. His response was ""I will handle him (the manager). Thank you for your help. Sorry for wasting your time."" I called the Regional Tech back and let her know about my conversation with the DM and she said she'd re-schedule the store with the other Assistant Manager.

By this point it was close to 10:30am, hadn't done much.  I hung around for another half hour and then called some friends who worked in the area to see if they wanted to get lunch and left.  I found out later that the store manager showed up shortly after I left.",Failure to prepare on your part means I get to go home early.,0

Very social and nice guy all around but heaven forbid, you’d swear what he learned a year ago is brand new to him now. My biggest gripe is that he is the most technologically illiterate techie I’ve met in my whole life yet here he is managing servers. He has no grasp of learning technical stuff by himself and can barely use office applications but use them daily. He can’t google as he has no idea what to type in as search patterns or how to sift through the garbage that google spills on you after you put in your search criteria. You might have a faint idea where this is going.

No, this won’t be a tale of how he brought servers down but he was quite close to often enough yet I got him out of that unfortunate scenario a few times. My tolerance for incompetence in the position some people are put without proper evaluation is very low.

So one morning John and me were off to go get breakfast after John was on first call doing needed server checks. Each week an admin is assigned to do server and system health checks starting from 5:45am and once done they can go get breakfast in the canteen that opened an hour later. I asked if one of the basic checks were done before we go eat just to ensure everything was done before our supervisor came in to ask the same question and get a surprise that ends up with us all getting a warning if not done.
John who was busy following me, halted in his tracks and then sprinted back to his workstation to obviously do what I just asked. So I said I’ll hang ten while he finishes. Something that literally takes a few seconds of opening an email and comparing specific outputs. Then he just sits there... and me knowing John, this isn’t good. I asked what’s taking so long? Him pointing at the screen and saying 2 of the replication servers aren’t in sync according to the email. I roll my eyes and asked him what he must do next? He stares at the screen blankly with no answer.
My first level of tolerance is being tested this morning, I could feel it. This stuff and the needed procedure to check it is documented and we been doing this for over a year now. How the hell does he not know this? So I step through with him from our wiki page as if he is brand new candidate. God help me.

Last step if both servers are in sync is to take a snap of it and reply with it on the email where it said otherwise to prove nothing is wrong.
So John, using Windows snap, takes a snap but instead of just the part that’s needed he takes a full screen shot. I tell him to do just a cropped snip to focus and show what on screen must be looked at upon which he replies his snipping program is broken, IT must come fix it. My eyes roll 360 degrees in my socket almost. 1st he needs to just configure snip to draw a rectangle for the snip and he has full rights as admin himself if he needed to install stuff - he himself was once a support technician - why call desktop support? I help here again because John is incapable to fix snap, the same stuff he should be able to help users with looking at his “supposed skill level”

Next, a common thing even users ran into which I remind you, we often assisted with years ago: pasting the snip or screenshot into an email. Yes, John couldn’t get this done. Why? Well if your email is set to text you can’t paste media obviously so you change it to html format. This was strike 3 of testing my patience in the span of 10min in asking myself how this guy still is able to work as Server Admin.

With mail corrected, snip pasted and email sent I breath a sigh of relief as my first hour at work just barely passed and I had to deal with this... really?
I felt like the gods were testing me to see my level of being patience those few minutes.
Upon return from breakfast our supervisor just walked in and sat at their desk for 5 minutes before asking the same question I did.

Wow, what a goddamn coincidence! Saved by sheer luck itself this morning for John. We could answer all is in order and confirmation email was sent by John. He just barely missed a warning if it was found out it wasn’t done or that he couldn’t even do such a basic check for the past year yet he ticked the step off everyday. I won’t even go into that...

I could also mention how basic functions like keeping a share name in place and moving it to another drive to make space does not logically cross his mind when recreating it - and he’s been doing this since the Server 2003 days.

Still a great guy but some people I believe must be periodically evaluated for their work skills as well and not just for being a nice person. Being nice will not bring those millions back when a server keels over due to incompetence.

"This is a tale of network admins, sys admin, developers, and infosec bros who all tried to flex for a C suite and ended up falling on their asses. No need to epic tales today. No embellishments. No dramatic pauses. Today I am simply going to retell the tale of how my brain got flipped right up side down. 

Bright and early at 8 AM a request comes in to have the paper replaced in an MFP. Now why the person didn't just replace it themselves? That is beneath them... 

Well anywho someone else in the office replaced the paper with one from the counter. Problem solved so I closed the ticket. 

Thirty minutes ago a ticket was directly assigned to me and I was told to resolve the issue. 

At 8:32 AM a C suite sent out an email to the ITALL email group that her printer was suddenly printing strange characters. Every single paper she printed had the same strange characters. 

At 8:42 notes were left in the ticket by the VP over IT that he redid the printer drivers and reinstalled citrix onto her machine. It still happened. 

At 9:03 AM the C suite responded back that several people in the office were reporting the same issue. Strange characters on the print job.

At 9:12 the deskside team reported that they replaced the laptop unit for the C suite person as a test and it failed. 

At 9:35 the system admin reported that he had gone in and verified that there was nothing malicious in the network connection. 

At 10 AM the ticket was forwarded to purchasing to have the printer replaced. A purchase order was prepared and sent off for authorization to the CIO. He took one look at it and decided to work on the printer himself. 

At 11:32 AM the ticket was forwarded to the citrix engineers team to see what was wrong with the citrix server. Everyone was printing the same strange characters and it must be an issue with the citrix environment. 

At 12:05 a note was left by a citrix engineer who reported that the citrix environment is not causing it. They printed to another printer in the building and it did not print the special characters they are seeing. He forwarded it back to purchasing. 

At 12:45 it was forwarded to CIO who instantly forwarded it onto the support team. It was auto assigned to me by my boss who told me to just get it fixed. No reason to replace a &gt; $1k printer over something like this. 

I email one of the people and ask them to email me back a picture of what the special characters look like. 

At 1:09 PM an audible ""Oooooh.... MY GOD!!!"" Can be heard from my desk. I get up and walk into the printer room and see the head of purchasing and the CIO both discussing the printer. Its an expensive printer and they do not want to replace it if they do not have to. One of the network admins is in there talking with the sys admin who looks at me and tries to shoo me away. ""We got it."" 

""Clearly you don't."" Escaped my mouth before I realized I said it out loud. I suppressed the panic attack as everyone is looking at me now. I walk over to the printer and open tray 1. I pull out the paper that has the festive border of streamers, ribbons, fireworks, and hotdogs around the edges. 

""This is the leftover party paper from the 4th of july office bash."" I said as I laid the paper on the counter. I pulled a fresh ream of paper from the stack on the right of the printer and loaded it in. Everyone in the room just quietly walked out without a word and went back to their desks/offices. 

I closed the ticket with the notes. ""Someone replaced the normal paper with the left over party paper from the 4th of july bash. Closing.""",I have no clever title for this post. My brain just broke.,0
"I'm the IT guy for a mid sized company. We do catering for bigger companies or highend private events. Therefore the tech we use (visible for the clients) must look nice.

(This is going to be some sort of a rant, so apologies in advance.)

A couple of years ago (before my time) some genius had the idea to buy a couple of iMacs. Because they look cool. The then IT guy agreed, because although we run everything in a windows domain with AD, Exchange, the works, you can install windows via boot camp and no problems because apple. Yes, they were convinced, that this was a brilliant idea.

Some time later, I was a trainee, they bought a couple more. iMac late 2013. And because I'm the trainee, it was my job to install windows on them.

I fought my way through this particular hell. It took me two days researching and try and error to figure this out. On the third I was able to install the three iMacs (after help from some cool apple msp dudes, one of whom I spend nealy two hours on the phone with troubleshooting).That was the day I decided to never ever agree to install windows again on a new apple device. (Well, I broke that once. But when your boss comes up and tells you to do something, there's only so much you can do as a trainee...)

Today, a good five years later, I remembered why I hated the process. One of the users with the last three iMacs complained that it took almost 10 minutes for the iMac to boot, for a couple of days in a row now and the USB ports are acting up for a while now. He had a two weeks vacation comming up and I decided to do a clean reinstall of OS X and Windows 7.

So, I back everything up and do a proper backup and away we go. Boot into OS X, delete the windows partition and update the OS. Ran the boot camp assistant. Oh. They only support Windows 10 now. Great... format the drive and reinstall whatever OS the iMac came with (Yosemite).

The rest of the day I spent rerunning the process and driving around town to gather what I needed. Only had a USB3 drive, so needed to buy a USB2 or Windows 7 throws a fit. Then it turned out the assistant wanted you to have a dvd (now I think about it, I may have misread something). So I had to borrow a super drive from someone (because I started to remember some of the BS of the process and I didn't want to use a non-apple device just in case it decides to throw another fit). At the end of day 1 the setup ran and I went home.

Day 2. I come in, look at the iMac. Won't boot because a certification error of a .sys file. It automatically downloaded the one Boot Camp version with uncertified files... Super... The next couple of hours were spent putting out fires, because after two weeks with next to no people in the office (because vacation time), suddenly everyone (of the 10-15 present) had urgent problems, while simultaneously finding the right boot camp drivers (because there's only one version that works and if you don't use that specific one... error message for you. And tell you what, it's not the latest one supporting windows 7).

The neccessary proccess, if you don't know, for a generation or two of apple devices, is that you needed to recreate a very specific constellation to be able to install windows via bootcamp. The thumbdrive with Boot Camp needs to be in the leftmost port viewed from the front, the Windows setup medium needed to be in rightmost. Not both on the same drive and don't you dare plug in something other than those two things. You needed to have a bluetooth mouse and keyboard, otherwise drivered weren't loaded properly and no setup for you.

So, after almost two days of headache, I remembered why I hate boot camp... Because it's ... moody at best.

Thank goodness I was able to talk them out of this nonesense of buying macs just to put windows on them. I don't care if they improved upon the bootcamp process. Either you use OS X or you get a proper windows machine...",How I remembered why I hate Boot Camp,0
"My friend is a mail carrier. Like other carriers, he has to carry a scanner with him. A notice was sent of and read to become familiar with the new features. It has a mediocre flashlight, menus that change with every update and a text feature so the postmaster can contact anyone at anytime, no need of a phone.   He looked at the symbols and looked through the menus. 

Several safety messages had been sent to test the text messenger. One day he was in a mood. The text message read something along the lines of “safety is an important. Work safe. That is the reality of our job”

There were preset text to reply to messages saying you received the message. Responding is mandatory. You can’t exit without responding. Otherwise the message will keep coming up. At the bottom of the response messages, there is create you own.

"Hello TFTS,

A short story that happened a few days ago, and I think it definitely has its place here. Our organization's $CISO called me directly to ask if I could check some PowerShell script written by another guy... but as you'll see, his request was more special than you can think.


&gt; *Phone rings*

&gt; $Me: Hello, $Me speaking.

&gt; $CISO: Hello $Me, are you by any chance familiar with some daily extracts performed from the Active Directory and then sent to $SomeBusinessApp ? $CIO also told me you were familiar with PowerShell ?

&gt; $Me: Yes, I'm aware of these extracts, what about them ?

&gt; $CISO: Apparently, some informations are missing from the extracts and it would seem that they're done with a PowerShell script written by $SomeOtherGuy, would you mind to take a look at it ?

&gt; $Me: I don't exactly provide support for PowerShell scripts, or script and programming and general, especially with scripts written by someone else...

&gt; $CISO: Yeah I get it, sure, but just to take a look and check if you don't see anything missing or that could explain why some data are missing, you know ?

&gt; $Me: If it's only to take a quick look, and nothing more, then alright. Can you provide me the script ?

&gt; $CISO: Actually... I don't have it myself.

&gt; $Me: So you know who has it ? The script's author, maybe ?

&gt; $CISO: He's actually on vacation until September so, he wouldn't be able to provide it.

&gt; $Me: So, do you know if it's actually stored on a server, a shared directory or maybe do you have at least, a screenshot of the script ?

&gt; $CISO: I don't know, and no, I don't have any screenshots.

&gt; $Me: *Remains silent for a good 30 secs, and then...* Well, I can't really check a script I don't have and that you can't provide me, so... I'm sorry but I won't be able to help you here.

TL;DR =&gt; CISO calls me and ask to check a PS script written by someone else because some data extracted from AD by the script are now missing. When I asked him to provide me the script, it turns out he doesn't have it, he doesn't know where it may be stored or who may have it, and the script's author is on vacation until September.

EDIT: Thank you for the Silver ! I'm absolutely surprised to get one for this kind of story, thanks a lot.",Can you take a look at this script ?,0
"backstory: I work at a very small ISP that offers DSL internet, at the time of the story I had been working in the support call center for about 1.5 years (I think). nothing is embellished in fact i left out many vulgarities since they were gross and also may not remember them exactly. Anyways rewind to 5 months prior and I had my first run in with ** customer** so I knew when we were dealing with a total idiot once i realized who he was later.




**OP**&gt;hello IT


**customer**&gt; my internet is SO slow. You need to fix it!


**OP**&gt; okay, what are the speeds your getting?


**customer**&gt; TOO SLOW CANT STREAM NETFLIX






I politely ask him to run a speedtest, we even have a speedtest server in house. And he indeed was getting slow speeds. About 6/10 mbps. And I can see total upload saturation. (Usually cloud backup). I tell him this and he doesn’t buy it. Nothing could ever be his fault.






**OP**&gt; do you have a laptop with an Ethernet port? Let’s try directly connecting your laptop and disconnecting your netgear (for his wifi)


**customer**&gt;so what I’m hearing is you don’t support net neutrality?!





I’m totally confused at this point shrug his weirdness off and state that in fact yes our **company name** fully supports net neutrality.





**customer**&gt; *scoffs* okay its connected it says 11mbps


**OP**&gt; great! I’m glad to hear that! 





Cue 5 minutes of me explain 3rdy party equipment and if he uses his own wifi equipment I can’t provide the same level of support than if he just used the router/modems built in wifi. He doesn’t believe me and the call ends with him being able to stream again.





5 MONTHS LATER





A co-worker I enjoy working with was on shift that night it’s the evening shift. She was new to the call center but I don’t think this was her first call center job. I usually half listened to all my coworker’s calls so in case I picked up something they didn’t I could offer a fresh perspective, or I learn something myself. I listen to what my coworker was telling the **customer** and everything seemed normal; slow speeds *have you tried turning it off and on again* ETC. I tune out and go back to scrolling.






25ish minutes go by and she’s still in the call, which in our call center we don’t worry about lengthy calls. Just that progress is being made and that the problem is solved, this is because we serve many elderly and have to go slow sometimes. I disregard and figure its problem some nice old person that can’t find their router (frequent “I don’t have a router”).





I hear a **coworker** in a less spunky tone than usual&gt; hey, **OP**? Can you take this call for me?


*She’s nearly in tears*


**OP** the nerd to the rescue!&gt; of course transfer him!





I ask what is going on and leave him in call queue limbo for a moment and pull up his info. She goes on to explain how he won’t listen to her and keeps saying how she clearly doesn’t know what she’s talking about and keeps saying he needs someone who knows more (while at the time I was more knowledgeable than her with computers and networking, this call was so far well within anyone’s in the call center’s capabilities that I knew **customer** was full of crap). How he’s basically putting her down for being a woman, huffing a lot and despite everything the problem persists with his connection. And then how he became a whirlwind of profanities and blaming the company for having a terrible product and it’s all our fault.



I crack my knuckles and take a deep drink of the go juice. Looking back this was my first tech support call fueled by spite and malicious compliance. This guy was a bigot and I was going to piss him off as best as I could by throwing the book at him. No one gets to treat my shift-mates like that. *Cue montage music* before I released him form limbo, I checked some things to try to paint the picture of what the hell could be happening. I looked at his ping time from our center to his router, it was acceptable delay time when it did check in but was only making the round trip about 50% of the time. So low latency but his packet loss. I looked at his actual connection strength (attenuation, margins, retrains etc) from the DSL equipment’s port to the router, and something was fuckey. And I had a feeling **coworker** had covered her bases and he might need a ticket or a router swap. 






I take **customer** out of the clutches of our dry hold music.
In my most considerate voice possible&gt;**company name** tech support, my name is **OP** how can I help you?



**customer** was now suddenly very calm and polite but seemed like he was on edge. So I start at the basics. He explained his problem and how its SO important that he gets it working again.


**OP**&gt; have you tried turning it off and on again?
Audibly taken aback at me asking him that&gt; of COURSE I have, do you think I’m STUPID? 
Knowing he surely doesn’t want the real answer, in a grossly positive and helpful tone I respond&gt; no of course not, we just need to go through all the steps, I don’t believe anything until I see it! And your connection seems funky so let’s start from the ground up
**customer**&gt; well we don’t need to, I KNOW what’s wrong already. It’s your guy’s crappy lines. I’ve had trouble since the day you installed!


*hmmm, you don’t say* I then quickly start to look at his documented history farther back than before


**OP**still 100% enthusiasm&gt; oh that DOES sound frustrating! Did you call?






I then continue forcing him to do every basic troubleshooting step there is (as per required before a ticket can be submitted hehehe) and can now see that he complained before (4 month prior) but refused to pay the company for the trip or time so we only check up to his Demarc. And his connection from the Demarc directly to us was BEAUTIFUL, exceeding speeds of 90mbps download. (I was slightly envious as I can only get 30mbps max at home using my aggregating router)





During trouble shooting now his connection dropped and no matter what I do it won’t comeback





**customer**&gt; yes you guys even came out. But wasted your time and didn’t fix ANYTHING.  (He didn’t let us)



**OP**&gt; was it just like this before?



**customer**&gt; NO it was slow and shitty before! But now you’ve broken it! And you will fix it before 7PM!





At this point I had done everything phone trouble shooting could accomplish (30 minutes due to his attitude). He blew his top when I told him that it’s going to be one of three things, his modem/router, the inside wiring of the house itself (after the Demarc) which he would have to pay for ** customer** blew up even more at the thought, or it would be the lines before the Demarc. He was PISSED and refused to listen that if it was past the Demarc it was not company property and he would be financially responsible for any rewiring done inside the walls of the house.





**customer**&gt; THEY ARE YOUR LINES YOU INSTALLED THEM! NOT ME! IM NOT PAYING FOR YOUR SHITTY WORK!





Next up was either swapping the modem/router for FREE because he could come to our building and we can hand them out as long as the old one is returned (call center 24/7).  Or a trouble ticket is placed and an installer goes on the next available day (usually next day for irritated customers). And looking at the time it was 5:30 PM





**OP**&gt; okay ** customer** I don’t think we will be able to get it working by then unle-


**customer**&gt; YES you WILL. You WILL call one of your tech people and have they come fix it by 7PM! 

 
**OP**&gt; look ** customer** we have done everything we can on the phone the only next step you could take is if YOU drive here and swap out your router and its cords for a new one.  Or we submit a ticket and looks like there is an opening for tomorrow. There’s no fee for the swap if you come by and-


**customer**&gt;so you’re going to deliver a router before 7PM?!


**OP**&gt; no you have to come pick one up


**customer**&gt;well IM not doing THAT, **company name** can come out and do it!


**OP**&gt; sure can, tomorrow in our next available slot


**customer**&gt; so what your telling me is that **company name* is interested and reimbursing me?





I was SO confused at this point at he was talking about. He sounded like I was supposed to be afraid. It was also this phrase that made me realize he was net neutrality guy LOL.





**customer**&gt; my wife has a VIDEO CALL scheduled for 7PM and we had to pay a lot of money to schedule it.  If you don’t fix your shitty internet by then and we miss the call **company name** is going to pay for it!




**OP**&gt; in here we are just tech support for billing questions you will have to talk to our billing department during business hours. 


**customer** refuses to accept this and we go in circles of “it’s YOUR fault FIX it!” He eventually gives up and I was able to schedule at ticket. I sling an email off to my supervisor and our CO department so they know what to expect in the morning. The CO supervisor had not left yet, I walk over and explain verbally why this ticket was extra special.






I wheel back over to **coworker** who now looks much less distressed and I spill ALL the hilarious and petty details.







THREE DAYS LATER






It was **coworker** and I again, she was back from her weekend and she asks what happened to ** customer**. TBH I had almost forgotten he existed. I pull up the ticket and it looks like he was very rude to our installers that went onsite, TWO very senior installers went. And using the through notes I left they started with the simple thing. 


They replaced the 4ft phone cord going from the phone jack to the modem/router. BINGO internet fixed and speeds back to nominal. He is billed for the full charge for the trip (usually if the call takes less than a few minutes the installer will waive the minimum service fee and labor charge. But in the end it up to the installers discretion). Meaning he payed nearly $200 for a phone line he could have had for free before 7PM the night of the call. We both laugh to near tears and drink more coffee in celebration. We usually NEVER get such a satisfying outcome.
   

I’m pretty sure this is the customer that made me realize how much I love talking to the angry customers. I’m pretty bored at work and angry ones are usually a hilarious change of pace; since its almost always easy fixes.
    

also a few days later **coworker** and I both get a talking to about he appropriate time to end a call due to abusive customers

Setting the scene: Multi-site retailer is in a multi-year project to refresh its network equipment and change managed service providers. I'm a contract tech who has worked with the outgoing MSP#1 for many years and also take service work for MSP#2. 

Existing service is some sort of DSL, with VoIP provided by MSP#1.

MSP#2 contracts with a local cable company to install the new internet service, so cable guy comes out and installs a new modem, but doesn't touch the existing setup.  He runs the direct burial coax around the property to the utility pole, telling the store manager that someone will be out to bury the cable a few days later.  So far, so good.

Cable guy with trenching tool comes out to bury the cable, cuts the buried DSL line in the process. Store loses phone service, and their network kicks over to satellite backup, which is slow as molasses.  

A couple weeks later, DSL provider comes out and runs a new cable along the ground to replace the cable cut by the cable guy and tells store manager that someone will be out to bury that cable.

(This story would be funny if the DSL cable trenching guy cut the cable, but it hasn't happened. Yet. Give them time.)

MSP#1 dispatches me a couple days later because one of the routers is offline and they can't get into the VoIP server. I find that the router/firewall device is offline due to an unseated power cord and the VoIP server is unreachable because the firewall was left enabled on the DSL modem, blocking inbound connections.  Two simple fixes.

While I'm on site, delivery company drops off the new analog telephone adapter (ATA) for MSP#2's phone service.  MSP#2 will send someone out to do that work.  I'll only see it if the installer screws up and I get sent out to fix it, which has happened for other stores in this chain.",The Cable Guy borks existing service,0
"A bit of context- I work for a company that provides software for clinical trials and Pharmaceuticals.

Story time. There was a Quality Assurance Manager with all sorts of letters after her name that proclaimed herself as a “Software Expert”.   You all know the type- takes every cert possible, no practical knowledge at all. Aka- good on paper. 

At the time, she was using an excel spreadsheet to handle tracking some data/issues. One of her poor staff entered new information in, and she couldn’t see it. I get rung to investigate why the excel file isn’t updated. I show up and the poor woman is getting screamed at by our alphabet manager about how she messed this up and the wrong information was reported to the VP of Quality who then reported the wrong information to the executive team. Uh-oh!

The analyst looks at me and tells me it’s there, and she entered it. I look, verify, and ask wha the problem is. Alphabet tells me it’s not, and there may be “latency in the refresh of the network files” (huh?) I look on her computer and sure enough - it’s not there!  

I ask the Analyst if she saved, she confirms; ok next step, ask her to do it again, just in case. She does. I ask Alphabet Soup to reopen the excel document, she rolls her eyes spews some nonsense, and does. Sure enough - the new info isn’t there. We start to check- show me the file you’re opening. She goes to a shortcut on her desk- file names match however I catch the problem. 

The self proclaimed software expert had copied the original excel file to her desktop and then made a shortcut to it on her desktop. She decided to tell me someone must have deleted the original shortcut and replaced it.

This tale dates back a bit to my days as a CCTV &amp; alarm installer.  I was roaming about the area handling service / break fix calls for things like non-working cameras, dirty lenses, bad door sensors, and other such simple issues.

&amp;#x200B;

It was an unusually warm summer day, with only the lightest of breezes to provide any relief.  The aircon in my service truck was only just keeping up, and I was already a bit of a sweaty mess when, around mid morning, I was radio dispatched to a high priority call.  The site manager for the local housing authority had called regarding the cameras and door entry being inoperative in one of their buildings in a rather run down bit of the city.

&amp;#x200B;

The only information I had been provided by dispatch was that all of our equipment was offline and not responding to remote reboot or diagnostic commands.  I made my way inside, having retrieved a set of keys from the management office, and and headed for the basement.  Upon opening the door to the basement stairwell, I was hit with a stench that could only be emanating from the depths of hell itself.  It was a hot, thick, evil smell.  I paused for a moment and double checked that this was, in fact, the door to the basement stairwell, and not a similarly marked door to the innermost depths of Satan's back passage.

&amp;#x200B;

Nope... It's the basement door alright.  Sucking in a lungful of fresh (-ish) air, i headed down. As i rounded the final bend, I came upon a site that haunts me to this day.  The bottom four or five feet or so of the stairs were submerged in a very dark, and somewhat lumpy fluid.  The basement was a massive lake of poo.  I Sir Robin'd right out of there (that is to say, bravely turned my tail and fled) back to the relative safety of my service truck, and radio'd the office.  As I was patiently explaining to dispatch the gravity of the situation, the site manager climbed up on my site step and tapped on my window to ask if the work would be covered under his service plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: *""No.  The service plan does not cover loss due to fecal inundation, I'm afraid.""*

&amp;#x200B;

I'd heard that once the basement was drained and access to it was possible again, it was determined that the sewage main had backed up and the pipe, unable to hold back that much pressure due to age, ruptured.   Every time a toilet was flushed or a sink or shower drain was used, anywhere in this 12 floor building, it ended up in the basement.  I did have to go back about two weeks later to remove the poo-encrusted DVR and alarm panel, re-terminate all the cables, and install new hardware.  I threw my gloves away.","That won't be covered under your service plan, sir.",0
"My boss asked me to pull old hard drives out of computers we wanted to refurbish and destroy them.  So I did that, then went hunting for a power drill.

Our business does not own a power drill.  Go figure.  And my experiments with a stupid tiny hammer and screwdriver set I found did not conclusively damage the disk, so the destruction was postponed until we could get a drill.

My boss goes on vacation.  He comes back with a tool set that includes a drill.  Finally, I can destroy stuff, except this office is Bring Your Own Safety Glasses, and I forgot mine.

Now, a state oversight commission has some people with offices in our building.  One of those guys stops by, sees the tools, and asks what's up.  I explain the hard drive situation.

He convinced my boss and I to postpone it until the guys from the state commission come to the office again.  I decided that they weren't allowed to have all the fun, so I invited all my (non-IT) coworkers to also take a swing at the drives with a hammer.  People are down.

"A post office was getting a new computer to replace the old one. My friend was asked to stop in and check the setup because the postmaster was very unsure about computers.   She didn’t think she could set it up on her own and wanted help. 

When he walked in, she had already setup the computer. A picture diagram was sent with the computer. Looking the computer over and comparing to the diagram, it was set up just fine. 

The problem was the post office network was no longer working. The postmaster couldn’t access the information she needed to do her job. After troubleshooting the basic problems, there was nothing wrong with the setup. Postmaster called the help desk. 

She was then connected to a computer tech. My friend kept hearing I’m not sure, I don’t know, I think so, I don’t know. He asked if she wanted him to talk to the tech. She very quickly handed he phone over, practically yelling yes.  I don’t understand him. 

The conversation is written from his point of view. 

Cast   Friend - Op.  T - computer tech.  Postmaster-M

Op-Hello. 

T-Uh, yeah. What happened to the lady?

Op-My guess. She couldn’t answer your questions. So she passed the phone to me

T-And who are you?

Op-unofficially, I’m the local computer tech. 

T-There are no techs in that area. 

Op-I know, I said unofficially. I’m a local carrier who knows about computers so they ask for my help. 

T-Oh, ok. Is the computer set up CORRECTLY?

Op-Yes, it’s set up like the diagram. 

T-There was a diagram?

Op-Yes. And I made sure it was set up just like the picture. 

T-Tell me about the about the setup. 

Op-Ok. Round cable cord. 

T-Do you mean a coaxial cord. 

Op-Yes. Connected to modem. 

T-Ok

Op-Rectangular cord out of modem. Looks like a big phone cord. 

T-You mean a cat5 cord?

Op-Yes. That cord goes into the Postco box. 

T-Why are you calling it a Postco box. 

Op-That’s what it says on the side. It’s a router. 

T-Oh, ok. 

Op-Out of the Postco box and into the computer. 

T-(short pause) Well that’s stupid!

Op-Ok?

T-Why don’t you hook the coaxial cable to the Postco box?

Op-Because round plug doesn’t fit in square hole. 

T-Uh, then I don’t know. 

Op-Is there anyone else there that can help?

T-My boss is behind me but he’s on the phone. 

Op-When he gets off the phone, tell him xyz office can’t get on the network. 

T-Ok. Maybe we could . . . Oh, he just got off the phone. Hang on.  He says we have to reset it from our end.

Op-Ok. Well . . . 

T-Were working on it. All set. Check the connection 

Op-Yup, looks good here. Thank you. 

T-Anything else I can help you with 

Op-Nope. In the future, please keep in mind most post office employees are computer illiterate and don’t understand technical terms. 

T-Ok, I’ll try. Have a good day

Hanging up the phone, he let out a big sigh of relief. 

Op-That was so frustrating. 

M-I know. He was using words I didn’t understand. 

Op-It’s ok if your working with someone who’s on the same level. Most people in the post office are not computer savvy. I understood but I didn’t care for the technical terms.

"I do support for a small CRM on the side on occasion. I got a ticket because according to the user, when they send emails through the CRM, it always goes to spam.

**Me:** ME, **CX:** Customer

**CX:** Ok, I'm beyond frustrated. EVERY e-mail I send thru $CRM is going into spam folders. Clients I have e-mailed hundreds of times to new clients. With a new or old e-mail address. It seems to be ONLY when I send thru $CRM system that this is happening.

**Me:** Do you have proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records set up in your DNS? *I had already run a scan and knew the answer, this just lets me know what kind of person I'm working with.*

**CX:** Everything is set up fine on my end. I can send them straight from my e-mail and clients get them. I send the same client an e-mail thru $CRM dashboard, and it goes to spam.

**Me:** Exactly. You have to set up those records (I checked, they’re not set up on your domain) in order to send through other sites or systems.

**CX:** I use Gmail addresses.

**Me:** So you don't have a branded email address?

**CX:** I do. And it's 13 years old, and not what I want to use any longer. This isn't a business lesson. We do lots of business. This is a ""gmail accounts shouldn't automatically be marked spam, while using a system like $CRM"" lesson. IMO

**Me:** Typically using a consumer email address to send mail through a CRM or email campaign platform will result in spam flags. You really should be using a branded email address, especially if you already have one, along with proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records.

**CX:** I don't plan on using my branded email with $CRM any time soon.

**Me:** That is your choice. I cannot force you to to do anything. I can only make suggestions.

"I'm starting to write this as I'm speaking with the client.  I am I (not Don Quixote) and him $CR for Clueless Realtor.

First time post in TFTS, 2nd ever on Reddit, new user, longtime lurker, native US English speaker, on PC, etc. etc.

TLDR at the Bottom

I get off work at 5pm, roll on home and make me some supper.  Shortly after 6pm (coincidentally when the last in-office technician leaves for the day).  My phone buzzes with an email notification - voicemail for the on call line.  Great, I'm still on call since the guy I was SUPPOSED to hand off the on call phone to was home sick.

I finished cooking and eating, then listened to the VM.  It's a realtor....great....these are either simple printer setups, or complicated printer setups.  Guess which one I drew?  We are primarily focused on small clinics, with a side of small businesses.  Among those small businesses are a number of realty teams, who are connected in name but supported separately.  Dozens of full time and part time realtors who are almost never in their home offices, though thankfully we only did active support for a few people.

$CR is part of a team that is run through a second team, the one we most directly support.  He called in from his home office with a printing issue he had been fighting for ""a while"", and had several documents that needed to be printed and arranged tonight.  I reach out to his direct cell, but have to call back because he's working on a few time sensitive emails.  Ten or fifteen minutes later I call again and we get started.

I thought I was walking into a driver mismatch, printer stuck in sleep mode, random connection error, or something of the like.  I wish that was the case.

A little background on $CR - he gets his designation from this call, and a previous call I only remember in a deja-vu like sense.  He speaks in a way that sounds like it's at the 75% speed you can set for YouTube videos.  Enunciated, slow, but not comical.  This is not an issue with an old printer, this was a new printer that was BARELY out of the box.  By $CR's admission, he has struggled with it for nearly two hours already.  He has managed to power it on and \*charge\* the ink.  That's it.  No drivers, no WiFi, no initial setup, nothing else.  Making things worse, our remote to connection to his computer (installed with a previous ticket) was slower than frozen molasses being pushed up-hill in the -50 degree winter we had here in MinneSnowta this past year.

Now, I've helped to remotely set up a variety of printers from unboxing to printing in my short time at this MSP.  What I haven't experienced to this extent is a user who has absolutely no idea what is going on.  I'm in a different city, working remotely.  $CR has to be my eyes, hands, and occasionally ears.  I can't see what they see, I can't physically interact with anything.  He asked if I did something on the printer or could see something several times during every single task item of each setup stage.  Every other line also included something about ""how good we are at computer issues"" or ""this is crazy"".

Keep in mind, ALL I've done so far is encourage him to plug it back in and set the language/date and time.  On his computer I install the drivers for this printer, which is smart enough to set itself up on the WiFi without needing a manual password or any physical intervention.  I've never worked with this type before - it's one of those where the ink comes in bottles and you fill the cartridge, then charge the printer.  I find a manual, but it's for a different model in the series.  Eventually I dig up the right manual on google, and even find a copy of the picture card that depicts basic physical setup.

After powering it on, connecting via WiFi, $CR swearing he charged the ink, struggling to find where to load the paper, we finally got to printing a test page.  Failed.  Printer manager pops up and its not recognizing any of the ink.  Great.

We're an hour and a half into this setup and we've accomplished MAYBE six minutes of work.  I skip past the test page window and go for the pending firmware update, hoping against hope it takes and magically resolves everything.  Firmware update completes and it didn't take forever.  Maybe I'm getting somewhere?  At that moment, that slim glimmer of hope, $CR decides we've spend enough time on it for the evening.  He has some family issues to address and asks if we can ""hookup on this"" again tomorrow night.  Now he's been as good as you can expect from someone labeled $CR.  Nothing was hostile or difficult (personality), just really really clueless.  In my infinite wisdom I agree to pick it back up tomorrow night, after work, when I'm not on call.  My co-workers do it all the time and to put this to rest I will too.

Possibly a Part 2 tomorrow if I get any interesting interactions and if anyone cares.

"My background, for those that haven't heard it; I've been in Helldesk, then sysadmin, now I'm an Implementation specialist for a company that deals in Law Enforcement equipment and software.  We released a Cloud version of our software product last year which is quite good.  And now that I'm outside customer-service type I often get to regail you guys tales from customer IT tech support... like the time Customer IT deleted the [Virtual Hard Disk that contained their database](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/aplc1n/but_there_was_nothing_on_that_drive_famous_last/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).  

Anyway to keep this short and to the point, I was given a deployment for a new to cloud customer.  They're already using some of our products and the on-prem version of our software, but now making the leap to Cloud.  They delayed the install by four weeks and it's been assigned to one of my colleagues.  However, I've been a bit of a fly on the wall in my colleague's discussions with IT.  Remember, this is a CLOUD solution the customer purchased.  All their data and their access to it is through a web portal in Microsoft Azure.

$CustomerIT: What's to stop someone from just logging into this at McDonald's or Starbucks from a laptop?

$Colleague: They would first need to authenticate using their Azure AD credential

$CustomerIT: We get that, but what's stopping them?

$Me (while phone is on mute):  That's how the cloud works.  That's kind of the reason you buy a cloud-based service so that it can be accessed from anywhere anytime.

So there you have it, an IT team that doesn't quite understand the Cloud.  Most of our Law Enforcement customers go with the cloud so that officers can access the data from the MDC and not place extra load on VPN infrastructure.  Then there's all the other benefits of a cloud solution... but I digress.",Customer buys Cloud solution; Customer IT doesn't understand how cloud works.,0
"Background: We’ve had a long standing performance problems with a few of our apps, mostly related to memory/CPU usage. It doesn’t affect everyone, but word gets around and users get… ideas about how their computer “should” work

I had a user who was reporting that their computer was running low on memory. So I went through the motions of setting up a time and collecting the data I needed. When I took a look at it there wasn’t really a memory problem; they have 16 Gb and most of the time they don’t even use 12. I cleaned up a few apps and make sure nothing is starting with the computer when it boots and send them on their way telling them to install the latest updates when they have a chance to reboot the computer (which they never did, in fact I doubt they did anything I asked them to as they probably weren’t reading my emails).

Not even a week later they tell me in a ticket that they have an important meeting and need a new computer urgently before a long weekend (Turns out they didn’t have any meetings that day or the next day they were in the office). They also copied all of the managers in the office, many of whom aren’t in their or my chain of command for “visibility”. We set them up with a loaner to help them with their non-existent demo with the expectation that it will be returned for their original laptop that we had just reimaged at the user's request. In my response to this I remove the extra people on the ticket and let them know we’ll need the loaner back within a week or so.

Then, their manager responds to the ticket, adding everyone again for “visibility” saying that the loaner fixed all of the non-existent RAM problems and that they’d like to keep it. I respond saying that we’ll need the loaner back and we need to finish troubleshooting to find the actual cause (which turned out to be the user wanted to have 50+ chrome tabs open at a time). I then remove the extra managers and respond telling them we need the loaner back and that we haven’t fixed the issue yet and the loaner won’t fix it long term. I also expressed how there are other users who have real problems with their laptops that we need to replace first.

Then I get this response:
“Adding [not my or their manager] and [not my or their manager] for visibility

I am not sure why we would give the computer back?”

And shortly there after the other two unrealted managers responded backing the user up saying they won't return IT's loaner.

*sigh* I really wanted to reply “Because you don’t own that computer and even if we replace it in the end we need it back” but it was clear this wasn’t going anywhere. Having yet to see any problem with their device, I copy my manager who chats with them and eventually sales management pushed a little harder and they ended up keeping the loaner laptop. I am seriously at a loss for this one, we *have* to provide data and evidence to back up our point and sales just needs to complain enough, and this isn’t the first time something like this has happened.

I recorded the laptop the computer that I gave him, and attempt to backdoor into it.  I contact him and ask him where the laptop is.  He isn't using it... he's using his old laptop. the one that the one I am working on replaced.

Monday. It was already a bad day as we had a lot of calls about systems that would not turn on. Ended up being fried power supplies and motherboards from some really bad storms that had gone through the South over the prior weekend. These were usually easy to diagnose and you'd schedule a tech to go out and try to resuscitate the machine with a new power supply, but company policy required us to go through the standard idiot test first. ie: ""Is it plugged in? Is the monitor plugged in? Is the monitor on? Is the power outlet receiving power?""

"Backstory- I was in the army working as an IT tech. Though I wore numerous hats, my office was under the help desk with a douche bag major. His take on trouble calls was- you were only supposed to be on them for 10 minutes. Never mind the fact that some calls took longer to walk a user through to come up with a solution.  We supported some very very remote locations (like need a helicopter to get to them because there is no road remote). The user in this story was a light colonel in a medical unit. He had been diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma and was going through chemo therapy.  He was a hard charger and continued to work remotely even though he was going through this treatment. Our office provided a laptop and cell phone so he could continue to work.

He was having trouble getting the laptop to connect to a wireless connection, so he could establish a VPN connection into milnet.

me- DOIM shop, SGT snuffy speaking

Fozy- It's LTC Fozy (not his real name), I'm having trouble with getting the laptop to make a connection.

me- Sir, let me call you back on my cell, so I can move freely and work the issue you have. (I went outside to pace the parking lot so I could focus on this one call)

me- Sir, where are you at right now?

Fozy- I'm at (army medical hospital) in my room. I see there's wifi here, but I can't get the laptop to connect to it.

me- Hmmm.. You see that little icon in the tool tray that looks like a radio tower in the lower left hand corner? Could you open that up for me? (we're working XP and this was before CAC usage)

Fozy- yes. I see it, opening. I see several access points.

me- can you right-click on one and connect?

Fozy- I did, it's not working. 

me- OK.. Hmmm.. Log out and we're logging back in locally with another account. (local admin account time)

Fozy- OK. Wifi is connected now. (success after pacing the parking lot for 3 hours on my cell with earbud trying to help a user with ""chemo brain"")

me- Great! Now fire up the VPN client and login with that. (user logs in and I can finish up the loose ends)

Fozy- I really appreciate you taking the time and patience with an old man that's not feeling his best. (he repeated this several times through the conversation)

me- Sir.. I can count on one hand. Officers that I truly love and respect. You are on that very short list. I understand your mind is a bit foggy from chemo, you do not have to apologize. If you have any further issues, please call this number day or night and I will help you to the best of my ability. He thanked me profusely and you could hear the emotion in his voice.

"A couple of years ago, I quit teaching. The hours sucked, the amount of work I did for the pay and recognition was no where near worth it and I'd never felt so worthless at the end of the academic year  than I did when I was a teacher. TL;DR, teaching sucked. Which really upset me.

So I decided I may as well stick to my degree and use it. After all, I did pay for it! I signed up with a job agency for an IT technician role; I had some experience from labs in uni in networking, I could manage AD, do all the usual 2nd line stuff and I was more often than not fixing issues with the school's computers myself as we had no in-house tech support, and the guys we had on contract were utterly useless. 

After a couple of days, I get a call from my agency contact who says he's got a couple of jobs I would be perfect for - both IT technician work in schools. ""Sure!"" I thought, after all, I'm going into a new field, so it would be good to be in an environment I'm familiar with and I have lots of ideas on how teachers can use tech to do what they do better. 

Long story short, I ended back at the first school I was placed at on teacher training, which was really, really useful as I knew the site, knew the guy who I was going to be working with, and knew the IT teachers and a good number of the kids (and I left that place on a real high note, I was gutted to have left!).

So a month or so passes and I get a call from the library, where there is a trolley full of iPads used for various things. Turns out, one of the screens has a pinkish, purplish tinge to it and no one could figure out why. No settings were changed but it clearly looked like a hardware issue. I took it back across the site to our office and began to poke and pry, rummaging around the internals to see if there was a loose connection somewhere. Nothing would work. 

Having had a particularly long week, I had a 'moment' and ended up dropping the thing. Face. First. 

'Oh, crap.' was the thought that ran through my head. 

Gingerly, I picked it up and turned it over. With my previous 'experience' of Apple products, I thought it was a death sentence for that week's pay, but no! The screen was physically as good as it was before on first inspection. 

'Ok, it's not completely borked I don't think, have I killed the internals?'

And I turn it on. 

And I am pleasantly surprised when the whole screen is displaying correctly in a plethora of kaleidoscopic colour and wonder, with none of the issues initially reported! I keep it in the office for an hour or so, checking it's all working, running updates, general use and so on and everything is absolutely fine! So we chalked it up as a 'potential' fix - drop it from maybe a foot, face first, onto the carpeted floor. 

A week later, we get another call. For the same problem, on a different tablet. ""Not a problem, I'll be right down and it'll be working again in 5 minutes."" and off I toddle to the library. It's a class full of (now) year 10 pupils, many of which I'd taught previously and after the usual banter I had going with all of them, asking how they were doing, etc. I crack on with the issue. I get handed the tablet and the class is all looking at me. You know the look. Expectant, anticipating, curious, judging.

I look up with a wry smile on my face. ""Don't do this yourself guys, I'm a *professional*"".

"Here is another recollection from long ago:

I was a lead developer/project manager for a software company and my baby was the insurance system we sold.

We had implemented the insurance system for a large agribusiness company here is Adelaide; this was around 1988/89.

They were an IBM AS/400 shop, but had a VAX/VMS system driving a Teletext server and our insurance system was also deployed on VAX/VMS systems.

They used their Teletext development team to build an interface between our system and their AS/400 general ledger (accounting) system; I think as they had VAX/VMS experience.

Their CIO was a very high powered hard hitting lady, not a Karen; BTW we became good friends over the years.

So the interface was deployed and then the proverbial hits the fan.  It does not balance, i.e. the reports from the insurance system did not match what ended up in the general ledger system.

So a meeting was called with all the appropriate players, including the customer CIO, my CEO, and team members from both sides.  About 10 people in the meeting, manager heavy.  I am sure our system is solid, as is our side of the interface.

So the meeting starts, all the normal formalities, coffee etc.

We get to the core issue right up front.  Everyone says their bit and it seems to be an impasse for a while.

I suddenly realise something, the Teletext system is written in Fortran, and our insurance system in Cobol.

So I ask the obvious two questions, A. What language did you use for the interface? and B. What data type for the money fields?

Answers: A. Fortran B. Floating Point (double)

Ka-ching!  I looked over at the customer CIO, she looked a little sheepish, I smiled and she smiled back.

Cobol uses fixed point for most data, especially money, and thus avoids the normal floating rounding errors.  Problem solved.

I guess people who don't work with financial IT systems don't always realise floating point is bad news.

"I was called by an client's employee who said everything they tried to do on the internet was being redirected to another website or just wouldn't work. A few short moments later, I am able to quickly determine malware had taken root.

Shocker I know...

I explain what has happened and the work I'll have to do to remove the malware and get the computer back to semi-normal operation. I also throw in a tidbit about the 55 day uptime on a Win7 machine.

"My friend works for the post office as a mail carrier. Over time, the subject of computers has come up. Especially since every office has at least one now. A bunch of the postmasters are computer illiterate and ask for his help. 

The postmaster where he picked up his mail would put a parcel marker in his post office box, just to make sure he would come in.

"This is a story from a couple of years ago when I used to provide IT support to medium sized businesses. Part of my job was to setup new workstations and make sure they are connected to the network and that the phones were working and that everything works basically.

One day a new client put an order through for 20 laptops with docking stations, mice and keyboards and 40 monitors. But when we arrived to set them up...

Me: The one and only ;-) |SM: Section manager (On the side of the client)| SP: Section Supervisor (On the side of the client) | R: Recepcionist | MM: My manager

*We arrived at the client early in the morning at 7am, all the desks were meant to be cleared of personal belongings and staff were meant to back up data on to a dedicated network share. The department manager sent an email copying my team in and all 20 staff members with the date and time we were ariving. We booked a parking space for our van two weeks prior to our visit. The parking space was right next to the enterance.*

*We arrived at the company and couldn't find the parking bay that we requested. Whilst my collegue waited in the car I went to ask recepcion...*

Me: Hi we're here from Company Name and were here to see SM, we booked this parking space but can't seem to find it.

R: Ok, let me have a look........................I can't find you on my system for this bay

Me: That's strange, here's the email confirmation

R: O, No, that can't be right this space is for vans only

Me: But we are a van, we are delivering and setting up loads of IT equipment for SM

R: O, No that parking space is not for IT it's for important things like the shop and the cafe on the first floor

Me: Excuse me? Look, I don't mean to be rude but we're here to do a job.

R: Allow me to call SM

*Put's the phone down*

R: It turns out that we do have a parking place for you but it was moved to this space. SM is on her way down to meet you

Me: Great thanks! I will just tell my collegue the parking number

SM: Hi Welcome to company name, Do you have many things to carry?

Me: Hi, yes we got all the requested monitors, laptops, docks, mice and keyboards you ordered as well as the cabling.

*SM directs me to the stairs*

SM: Right we're based on the 19th floor

Me: Blimey! Where are your lifts?

SM: Visitor lifts open at 9am

Me: Pardon? Do you have staff lifts?

SM: Yes but you're not staff and were not insured to carry visitors in those lifts.

Me: We are not walking up all those stairs!

SM: hmmm, ok let me ask security, Ok you're allowed to use the lifts follow me

Me: Thank god!

*We got up to the 19th Floor and were shown the desks, none of which were cleaned, they were extremely dirty with rotten left over food and it stank. None of the staff members backed up their data either. SP met us by the lift*

SM: Right this is SP, she will be taking care of you today.

Me: Hi Nice to meet you!

SP: A yes very good, Follow me, this is the desks you will be clearing, there's some rubish bags in the cupbord just here. Make sure you split the rubish up for recycling. All the old computers are to be loaded into my van at this parking space. All staff members have left me their log in details on this pice of paper for you to transfer the data. *(Looks in bag for pice of paper)* O dear me, I must of left it in the cafe on the table, let me just go down and get it.

*Guess what parking space it was (THE ONE WE BOOKED)*

Me: You made your staff right down their log in details on the pice of paper and left it on the table in the cafe? These people must change their passwords now! That's extremely dangerous, especially since you left it unatended. You Don't ask people to right down their log in details!

SP: DON'T BE SO RUDE!

Me: Excuse me? We are an IT company we were promised that all this will be done before we got here!

Whilst SP went down to get the log in details, *I decided to take some photos and send them to my manager. I then gave him a call...*

Me: Hi, were at this company name job *I explained what has happened*

MM: You are joking me right? I just seen the photos you sent, no I'm not having two of my workers putting their health and safety at risk. Go back to base and explain that you can't do the job due to health and safety reasons and tell SM to check her emails. Explain that we still have to charge the call out fee

*When SP got backed we asked to speak to SM*

SP: What You Think you're doing standing around chatting! Get to work NOW!

Me: Can I speak to SM please

SP: Not until you finish your work

Me: It's important

SP: Ok, Ok, I'll get her down for you

Me: I'm sorry but after seeing the circumstances, my manager has canceled this appointment to a time when you're prepaired. He asked me to tell you to check your email and that he is still charging you for the call out.

SM: THAT IS REDICOLOUS! WE EVEN PAID FOR THE BIN BAGS FOR YOU TO TAKE THE RUBISH OUT! IS THAT COST BEING REFUNDED? TRUST ME YOU TWO WILL BE OUT OF A JOB TODAY AND I WILL MAKE SURE YOU NEVER GET ANOTHER JOB EVER AGAIN IF YOU DON'T FINISH THIS NOW! YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA CALL THIS STUPID \*\*\*\* OF A MANAGER AND HE WILL TO LOSE HIS JOB TOO! I WILL TAKE YOUR COMPANY DOWN YOU WAIT FOR TOMORROWS NEWS PAPERS.

*We got escorted out by security.*

We went back to base to witness an argument over the phone. It turned out that SM had a massive go at my manager over the phone and he terminated the IT Support Contract.

Two days later we were called to a meeting with SM's lawyer but after my manager showed the photos as well as the conversation he recorded. The lawyer phoned up the client to say that he dosen't deal with clients like that and left the case. - Must have not been paid!

Two weeks later and curtesy of my manager, the client has undergone a health and safety inspection which it failed, but the company was never given the chance to improve as two Months it went bust

"So, here's a little story for y'all. Not much tech support per se, but the best description of a PEBKAC I've seen.

The cast;

Me: Dental Student, home for summer break, general gaming and pc nerd, I know enough to not break my pc

Dad: 40 year old architect. Arguably tech-savvy

The scenario;

Parents recently (ie a few months ago) bought a Smart TV with Netflix and have been using the shit out of it alongside my little sister on summer break, nothing untoward, works as advertised, Dad finds internet speed on TV to be around 80Mb/s wired. I come home and a few days later the internet speed has hit the floor; it's lucky to hit above 0.5Mb/s.

\*OhShit.jpg\*

Guess who gets the blame.

\&gt;Dad: Elkubik get down here right now! What have you done with the internet! Have you been messing with the router!?

\&gt;Me: No. (I mean, sure I game and watch YT and stuff upstairs but that \*really\* shouldn't)

\&gt;D: Well fix this!

\&gt;Me: Have you tried turning it off and on again?

\&gt;D: Yes! Jesus!

Ok then. Let's have a looksee. Router looks like it's working. Fire up speedtest first on my phone as it's on hand. 50Mb/s. Fine, acceptable. Go over to the only other wired PC in the house (everyone else is on laptops, and the computer is the one my dad \*borrowed\* after his previous died and I went to Uni, really quite a coincidence if you ask me), in the office. Fire up speedtest on there, 70Mb/s. Everything works perfectly fine.

Go back to my parents restarting the router (because it's clearly the router's fault seeing as every other device ~~can't connect~~ connects just fine). Sit there for a few minutes as the ~~annoying little piece of shit~~ router finally decides to return to the world of the living.

Queue 10 minutes of attempting to connect the TV to the router. Can't find the wired network, fails to connect to any WiFi network that it could connect to. Notice while browsing through settings that it's on Android. Remember that my own Android phone tends to derp out every couple of months and refuse to speak to any other device. On/Off fixes this.

\&gt;Me: You are \*certain\* you turned it off and on again?

\&gt;D: Yeah. Look. *Presses power button.*

Screen turns off instantly, no ""power off"" or anything.  Instant red flags.

\&gt;Me: You're sure that isn't sleep?

\&gt;D: No way, look, all the lights are off!

\*facepalm.png\*

So I take the remote and ""turn the TV back on"". Lo and behold it's still displaying the settings menu, with no boot or anything. Long press of the power button on the remote gets me a ""powering off"" notification, and the TV actually, finally, powers off. For the first time in months. What a surprise when, upon powering back on, we get a nicely animated splash screen and a long wait (ok I exaggerate, maybe like 2 minutes) until we're greeted with the main screen of the TV. Go into settings, reconnect to WiFi first, takes me a good minute (of which most was typing in the password with the stupid ABC keyboard layout that every TV and console maker seems to love). Wired took the best part of 10 seconds. Netflix's own diagnostic gives us a speed of 70Mb/s.

And that's how my parents discovered that the TV can be turned \*off\* and I discovered not to trust the user to be able to perform even the simplest of tasks.

"The company I work for is currently remodeling the first floor of the building. They are turning into a show piece to bring customers in and show off and WOW! people. I'm part of the design approval team because I'm in IT and the company FINALLY figured out we need to be part of the process (after 4 other remodels in various locations).

I got the newest revision of the plans today and notice AGAIN that they didn't include a space for networking equipment so I went across the street to the architurkey firm designing the place. I asked to speak to the architect and inquired about a centralized networking spot and he said ""we decided it won't be needed and left it out"". I stood there for a moment and then picked up my jaw off the floor and asked (in a more diplomatic term) WTF?!?!? He tried to explain that it wasn't going to be too bad we that we just needed to figure something out. I looked at the plans and there are 43 (not a typo) displays (tv with no sound) and 96 network drops. I asked about the wiring and he said ""it won't be a problem"". After some more back and forth I walked away.

Fast forward a few hours and I got my two wheeler (aka the dolly) and wheeled a full sized rack across the street and up to the architurkeys office and asked where they wanted it. Dude came out and asked what I was doing. I said ""I need a space for the equipment that is going to run the network and the displays so this is the first of 4 racks I'm bring over to hook everything up when the time comes. He starts spluttering that it can't be done like this and I say ""well sir, I've got a fiber line that runs under the street so I CAN run it over for everything"" (I know...we'd need more equipment...but he didn't lol) and I ""figured out"" where I'm going to hook everything up...HERE

"This story is from 2006. Ever since I got handy with computers I helped my dad with the computers at his company office. He had 2 old flat case systems with the screens on top of them. 

One day I came from school and went by my dad's office. As soon as I walk in he starts asking me to check out one of the systems because it wouldn't start, the screen stayed black. I could tell he was very agitated and I wasn't having a good day either. As I just walked in I wanted to have a drink first but my dad wouldn't have it and kept pushing me to check the computer.

I resumed getting myself a drink and sat down at the canteen table. He kept asking and finally I said: ""Just throw it against the wall and see if that helps."" Guess what? He did. He grabbed the case from under the screen unplugging everything in the progress and walked outside. He then just threw it against the wall outside and walked away.

I was flabbergasted. The case was broken and it seemed lost. I plugged it back in to see what would happen. I pressed the power button and the screen turned on...

It was working! Windows was booting again and the computer was fine. I didn't dare say I told you so to my father but I was definitely thinking it!",Throw it against the wall!,0
"I lived in a small town up until a few years ago, and was good friends with a lady who had a small insurance business in said small town. When she had problems with her computers, she would call me. I wasn't really techy then, but I wasn't afraid to mess with computers.  I would google, reinstall, reboot, etc., and nine times out of ten, I could fix her problem. She thought I was brilliant. :)

One day I got a call as I was leaving for a dr's appointment. I couldn't turn around, so I had her explain the problem to me over the phone. Her laptop suddenly stopped connecting to wifi. I told her I wouldn't be able to help until I got back from my appointment.

But then, before I hung up, I remembered something. My laptop would lose wifi connection at random times, also.  After a bit of searching (I probably had to google it), I finally realized that there was a little toggle button on the front of the laptop (accessible even when the laptop was closed). That button could turn on/off the wifi (why?!). Additionally, that button could be unknowingly toggled when I would lean forward and brush it my body (terrible design!).

Her laptop was the same brand as mine!

Ha! I knew what had happened to her wifi!

I told her to look for a button at the front of her laptop, and to toggle it back on.

"Our group was level two support (deskside) at huge mega international company, manufacturing plants 6A/B. Millions of square feet of production space - large enough for trains to roll through the factory itself, load and unload materials and products and happily chug their way off to other facilities around the country.

People in our group consisted of a displaced full-time worker who used to do something else before being shunted to our support group to run out his retirement clock, several contracted employees who were hired by staffing firms who filled 3rd party contracts to fill catalog numbers in the HR catalog (seriously, see epilogue to the post below), and a newly ordained real employee manager, level 1 (the lowest possible managerial classification there was) to oversee us all.

There was an internal call center for level 1 support in the basement of a building at the global HQ building several miles away. Anything they didn't get would be sent to us for on-site support.

One day, shortly after 11am there was a sudden burst of calls routed our way from the users in the Second Floor, West section. A few dozen engineers reported that networking services had slowed to a crawl, and they were being dropped. Not terribly uncommon, our site was using Token Ring, and users would frequently kick a cable loose, or the token would fall out of the cable and roll under the desk, and a bad termination to any one computer in the circuit would cause problems for all.

After an hour or so of unplugging and replugging the cables under all of the desks, making sure Windows 95 had the correct drivers and all of the settings were correct, the network seemed to be back to normal.

Next day, shortly after 11am, same group of people called and reported the same network problems. I checked the last computer that I had checked the day before on the assumption that since the issues went away when I checked that computer it was the most likely culprit and was due for a new NIC, not a rare occurrence. But the problem persisted.

So the case went to G, a network engineer who had his own cubicle a few prairie dog holes down from me and did nothing but make sure that the several hundred PCs on site would network, the very expensive fiber connections between the switches and closets would fiber, traced bad wiring and other network only things. G didn't talk to any end user for any reason. Every issue with the network came to his attention through us. His troubleshooting included using a packet sniffer and identified the problem as being in the special cube.

The special cube was occupied by a manager, level 5. He was the highest ranking person at the site who didn't have an actual office with an actual door, but was special enough to merit cubicle walls that were about 6' high, as opposed to the 4' walls typical for everybody else. His cube was larger, with room for his desk and three visitor chairs across from him. Nobody was quite sure what he did, but he did it with power and authority.

He would come into the office around 10 or 10:30am, read some emails, then launch this brand new program he had discovered on the internet - his authority granted him unlimited browsing through the firewall - and when we showed up he was anxious to show us the amazing awesomeness of PointCast. No more having to go to web pages to look up sports scores and headline news like a sucker! PointCast would stream the fresh, new and recent updates to his computer without lifting a finger! He would run the software for an hour or two, then shut down his computer and leave the building for some very important meetings.

We explained to him that company policy prohibited the installation of any software that was not on a very short list of approved packages. He initially allowed us to uninstall it, but a few days later it was back, in all of its network saturation glory.

Nobody in our group, nor at least three levels up in IT support outranked him so we couldn't force him to comply. The people being kicked off the network were almost entirely engineers who reported to him through one or two intermediate layers so he could dismiss their issues with a wave of his hand, and they were happy to slack off for a bit during the day - or at least work on the software they could use without needing the network.

Eventually came the solution: after about six weeks of this he loudly declared that PointCast was boring, he was tired of the constant crawl of text that never told him anything interesting - occasionally crashing in the process - and summoned a level two to his cubicle (he didn't have to call the level 1 call center) to scrub the buggy program from his machine. Before 1:00pm because he had a very important meeting offsite.

And just like that the networking issues vanished.

Epilogue: catalog numbers.

The way humungo corp did hiring involved an HR catalog. When somebody was needed to fill a position a manager would consult the list and submit a requisition order for, say, ""deskside support, full time - P/N 4001992"" and HR would carry out the steps needed to make it happen. Needed a new engineer, secretary, metallurgy tech, you find the part number and submit the purchase request. Needed a new coffeemaker, fleet vehicle big screen TV to mount over a loading bay?

Contrasting to the rambunctious silly nature of the clan engineer, these docile workers were peaceful, quiet, calm - rarely a sound beyond a softly ringing phone, muted yet brief conversations, and the gentle tap of the keys.

In short, it was a veritable koi pond, worthy of a zen destination for meditation.

As a priest of the second order I had but rare occasion to visit the oasis of peace. In the bowels of the white archcathedral of capitalism resided a cave of toil, where the lay clergy of the first order would answer the phones a-ringing to identify issues and attempt to purge the souls of the minorly inconvenienced. For all imperfections unresolvable by the first order, a ticket of routing would be dispatched to the 2nd order, some 30 miles distant, for the personal and hands-on resolution they and only they could provide.

The first order was quite occupied in their tasks, with hold times occasionally reaching some 15-20 minutes before they could speak to the troubled spirit, as what happened the day that a resident of the koi pond vocalized on the line.

&gt; I was laboring in my document of excel, a pop was heard, the screen went dark and the smoke from within the computer has been released. How can I recover my document?

To which replied the acolyte:

&gt; Lamentations, it sounds as if your computer has suffered damages physical. I shall dispatch a priest of the second order forthwith. Did you unplug your computer when the smoke did start to billow about your feet?

To which she replied:

&gt; I did not, for I have been repeatedly instructed to never simply turn off a computer without a prior click of button of start, then shutdown. When my image of computing vanished from the pane of visions I could no longer see the button of start to select the shutdown prayer and have therefore been waiting these 15 minutes to receive your guidance.

The priests of the second order were sent a urgent page of utmost priority to investigate, where they found a fried power supply, a lovely odor of burned electronics and wiring, a very passive and calm user, and a few dozen other cubicles filled with people who were not reacting to the events unfolding.",Smoke in the koi pond,0
"First post on this subreddit. Figured it might go here (let me know if there is a better place for it). This is not me, this is a story a coworker told me from the 80's.

Coworker of mine (let's call her Rachel) at this government agency works mainly with software, but sometimes acts as the go to person for IT help before formally a submitting a ticket to IT. So this was back in the 1980's. The agency was transitioning from IBM Selectric typewriters to these new fangled IBM mainframes with monitors. One of the older ladies who had worked there for a long time  (let's call her Susan) and would type out checks every month, somewhere in the range of 150-250 checks every month. Now, when trying to correct an error on a type writer, there is no backspace. You have to go in with whiteout the wrong area. Quick cover up, blow on it to dry it, you're all fixed. She got really good at quickly correcting her errors.

In come these new fancy computer monitors on which Susan is to input her checks on. Rachel looks over one day to see Susan correcting one of her mistakes, by applying whiteout to the computer monitor screen and then blowing on it to dry it. Rachel had to come over and help get the white out off and show her how to actually delete errors (little spit and a napkin. CRT screens were thick and tough).  They had a good laugh about it.

TL;DR older employee who is used to fixing typewriter errors tries to fix a computer error by applying whiteout on the screen",Typewriter fix =/= Computer fix,0
"This happened way back in 2012. English is not my primary language so apologies in advance.

I was working in an advertising company as a ""swiss knife"" which basically means the guy who fixes everything computer related. We we organizing a big event, and we were going to give a press kit. A nice folder, some A4 papers with a press release, and a CD containing a pdf presentation. 1000 copies.

Paper stuff was some other guys responsibility, so I got the pdf, went to a cd duplication store, they duplicated 1000 copies, with that organization's branding on them. also had some extra copies were made to be show to the client. Everything was ready the day before that event.

At night, around 21:00, my phone rings, my boss calls me

\- Hi, so the organization manager wants to change the filename on the CD's, its ""brand\_presentation.pdf"" he didnt like the underscore lets make it ""brand SPACE presentation.pdf""

\* excuse me what? are you serious, CDs are already burned, its 21:00, the event starts at 10:00 tomorrow, how am I supposed to to this?

\- make it happen I dont care how.

I called the CD burning shop, closed obviously

quick thinking. we have 10 iMacs at the office. I have my work macbook, another macbook at home, let's bring it to the office. pdf is small in size, this operation may be possible.

I called 2 of my coworkers, ""I will get you food and beer please come to the office and help me"" they said ok.

I drive to the office.

I like to backup things. By total chance, the week before I ordered 2000 empty unbranded CDs and 2000 empty CD stickers to the office.

So here we are, 12 Macs, 3 guys, 1000 empty CDs, 1000 empty CD stickers, food, beer, and a stupid pdf with some space in the filename. We started burning the CDs.

It was like a ford car assembly line, I put empty CD to one computer, move to the next one, as I put the 12th cd into 12th computer the first one is finished so while I was feeding the machines with CDs, one guy ""handwrites"" the organization name on the stickers with a nice calligraphy and the other one puts stickers on CD.

We started around midnight and finished around 8 AM.

zero sleep, I drive to the venue, drop the CDs to the press desk, started putting them into press release folder, and here comes ""that"" manager.

he asks me ""why these CD are not branded with actual graphics, why are these handwritten?""

""OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD""

"I support an application across seven different locations.  It's not critical for business, but when it goes down, it makes people hyperventilate because they don't remember how to do the same function the old fashioned way. Thankfully, downtimes for this application are a rare event.

Yesterday we had one of those rare unplanned downtimes.  It's not my first rodeo, so I pull out my downtime procedures and start going down the list.  One of the things I have to do is notify the users and the only way to do that is to send an email through the administrative departments of all seven sites.  Five of the sites were perfectly fine with this and sent the message out to their people with no trouble.  Then we get to the other two sites.  I sent the message to administration, only to get a reply from the person I sent it to asking if the head of their department, we'll call him Mr. Bigshot, had approved the email and if so, to forward his approval email because they don't send ANYTHING without Mr. Bigshot's approval.  

Small problem with that:

1.  Mr. Bigshot is notoriously hard to get in touch with.  I can send him an email with a question or a request for more information so I can fulfill a request of his and he won't respond until I resend it two or three times and copy my boss and my boss's boss on the messages, if then.
2. Mr. Bigshot is currently out of town until next week.  
3. This wasn't some pointless message.  The system was down and the end users needed to know to use their downtime procedures.  

I responded back with points #2 and 3 and copied my boss (she knows what a PITA these two locations are and what a PITA Mr. Bigshot is).  I never got a response from the administration department, so I'm not sure if the end users ever received the message or not.  Fortunately, the downtime was resolved about an hour after I sent the message out, so there likely wasn't enough time to cause mass panic. I think once Mr. Bigshot gets back into town next week, I'll ask my boss to get in touch with him and ask for a blanket approval on anything I send so that I can avoid this. 

If I'm lucky, I might get a response by Christmas.",I'm Mr. Bigshot and I Approve this Downtime,0
"This happened way back in 2008. English is not my primary language so apologies in advance.  


I was at mandatory military service as an ordinary private, but my ""talent"" in understanding computer related stuff got me some desk job, and ""me the military soldier"" quickly turned out to ""me the tech support service soldier"" in service of the ranked officers. I was actually doing computer and other technical maintenance stuff at the base, until that one day I had the most extreme tech support I ever gave.  


It was around 23:00 and I was in bed ready to sleep, idk reading, maybe? I got called to the hq by one of ranked officers. I got told to dress civil clothing. ""at this hour? ok"" I said and went. There was this high ranked officer in his personal car, ""get in"" he said, ""I have no internet at home"" wow.  


So we drove like 20 minutes to his flat, in a 2-building complex, each got 12 floors (important) his was 5th floor.   


We got into his house, he showed me his computer, no ethernet connection. ""show me the modem"" I said thinking this should be easy, bad or disconnected cable.  


He pointed that one other building, 7th floor.  


""- what?""   
""\* there it is""  
""- ..... how.... why""  
""\* that guy pays and we share""  
""- oh you mean both of you""  
""\* no we as two building""  


So, yes. ""That guy"" pays for a 8Mbit ADSL connection and shares the connection to 2 entire, 12 floored building.  


I asked ""how did you connect""  
he said ""there is a cable on the roof""  


Naturally I said, ""lets check the other guys modem cause there is no way I'm going to the roof"", forgetting that I'm a soldier and technically I'm under order so the officer told me I should check the roof first and thats an order.   


So we went up 12th floor, only to find the trap door locked with a huge padlock. The officer said the guy who has the key is on vacation, I thought ""ok great this adventure is over"" but noooo, he phoned ""his foot soldier"" to find a cutter and and bust the padlock with a cutter. please keep in mind that its about midnight now. after 20 something minutes, the padlock is cut and roof door opens.  


I went up the the roof, found the ethernet cable which comes from the other bulding, followed it, and reached to...  


a network switch, covered in pidgeon poo, its cover plastic melted, and obviously not working.  


I took the switch from the poo pile, got down the ladder, showed him ""this is the problem"".   


and the officer called some guy again. its probably 01:00 am now. give the phone to me, and I ""ordered"" a switch at this hour.   


and yes, it was delivered by car.  


and yes, I installed it, got the internet working, and his ""foot soldier"" drove me back to base.

"Quick one for you all today. One of my developers got a new desk phone extension like a month ago. We expect to get a couple of calls a week from people asking for help or explanations regarding our applications. Since the new extension went in he's been getting calls 3 or 4 times a day for the person who previously had it. Without further explanation, the funniest exchange thus far:

Caller: ""Hi I'm calling for Such-and-such Johnson, I need to speak with him, it's urgent.""

Dev: ""Sorry, but this is a new extension for me, you should check the directory or get the operator to connect you to his extension.""

Caller: ""That's fine, just get him on the phone.""

Dev: ""Excuse me?""

Caller: ""Look, I know his extension, I know hes there, get him on the phone.""

\*Dev looks at me completely confused, then hands me the phone\*

Me: ""This is Dev's manager, is there something you need from Dev?""

Caller: ""I know this is is Such-and-such Johnson's phone, I don't give a fuck who you are, get him on the phone right now or I'll make sure you don't have a job in the morning.""

Me: ""Oh, Such-and-such... yeah he hasn't worked here in 2 months since he got caught stealing laptops...""

Caller immediately hangs up. I dialed the number back, got a not-valid response... I wish we had those phones recorded, cause I'm 99% sure that was one of the dudes he was selling equipment to.

"The following happened a couple of years ago while I was working for a customer-facing, remote support outfit that did the occasional in-home visit. This was an interesting thing that happened towards the end of my time with the said company its less of a tech issue and more of a customer service issue but I figured I would share. The second bonus story below that is more of a tech issue

So for your reference, the company has several levels of tech support. Also, none of the names are the real names.

L1: Essentially a trained monkey performing triage, they are as likely to make a problem worse as they are to make it better.

L2: These guys do more advanced troubleshooting, generally safe hands, they know enough to be dangerous.

L3: The nutjobs that can figure out the weird shit, lots of experience, lots of tribal knowledge, essentially a walking knowledge base.

L4: A developer, the eldritch beings with knowledge beyond that of mere mortals like myself, to disturb one was as likely to get you eaten (read fired) as it was to solve your problem.

OL1: Essentially an L1 that we would send onsite to a clients home to do something stupidly simple. Now the company has 1 or 2 people for this job in a given area, and typically another 4 or so who can be paid on a job by job basis.

OL2: Essentially an L2 agent that would go onsite and then contact an L2 or L3 acting as their eyes and ears. Expensive service.

Technically we also offered OL3, but it was far to expensive for most people to afford, and we also offered OL4 on a technicality, but only an L4 can schedule an OL4 (Typically themselves).

At the said company I was an L3, I started off as an overqualified L1 and then worked as an L2 for a year before being promoted to the level of my incompetence L3.

The customer service

So there I am watching a batch of L1's who are trying not to have a nervous breakdown as they prove they can be L2's. My job essentially is to step in if someone fucks up horribly, otherwise, its to provide technical tips that would normally require digging through the companies terrible knowledge base.

Where I am sitting I can keep tabs on things, and one of my L1's (Suzy) starts to frantically wave her hand to get my attention. I open the call at my desk and start pulling up the client (Betty's) history. It is extensive, most of our clients the case history loads instantly, for Betty it took a good 30 seconds to load. This is why Suzy is frantically waving her hand. Betty is on the phone is being patient, simply just trying to schedule someone out to her home to set up or fix her printer(she isn't certain what is wrong). Except she is also requesting that a specific person (let us call him David, which isn't his real name) not be sent out to her home, as he has been involved all her recent onsite visits and has never actually completed a job to her satisfaction.

So i get up and visit my l1, who is very frustrated because all the ol1's in her our are scheduled and none of our contractors are taking jobs at the moment. So the only ol2 in the area is fucking David. Now having worked with david many times i can tell you david is a piece of work. The issue isn't that he is incompetent, it is that he is both lazy and dishonest.

So I take over at this point and let her know that the only option is David unless she wants to wait three weeks or call in every day to try and get one of our contractors. She decides to call in every day because she really hates David.

So we leave the ticket open and David sees this open ticket in his area and reschedules it (not unheard of). I call Betty and cancel the appointment explaining that David had scheduled himself. This happens the next two days in a row so i cancel it and add a note that David isn't to touch this appointment. David sees this and closes the ticket only to reopen a new identical one it but he redoes the onsite service from an OL2, to an OL4 and has assigned it to himself. Essentially making the price jump from about 40(for the service), to 500 (per hour with a two-hour minimum).  I see this the next day that she calls in and is rather upset because David had shown up at her home to try to do the job.

I quickly run the situation by my boss (Ken), who quickly runs it by our sites L4 (Fred). Now Fred is a nice guy, but his time is expensive hence why no one bothers him. So Fred gets a wicked smile and has me call up David.

I get David on the phone and Essentially tell him to go to his car and wait. We get on the phone with Betty and let her know that we are making an exception and sending

Fred, myself, Ken and Suzy all drive 30 minutes to Betty's house and while the Fred and I are essentially redoing the last six months of work that she has had asked to be done (because of david). Meanwhile, Suzy is driving David and my boss back in the company car that David was driving.Fred and I carefully go through each and every job that David was supposed to do and ensure that they are all done correctly, it takes a couple of hours but we get betty sorted and let her know there will be no charge for the visit.

We get back to the office and David has been let go for essentially doing jobs to the ""good enough"" point and then calling it a day.

Bonus story an actual technical issue.

This was when I was working as an L2 for the aforementioned tech company.

Client calls in and is trying to get wifi working on his computer. This is a new client who was referred to us by a neighbor of his. One of our L1's talked to him on the phone and what essentially had happened was he was getting broadband internet for the first time. Now his new ISP had provided him with a wireless router/modem combo. So he calls us because he wants to use it wirelessly because the ISP dude told him he could. The L1 hops on our sales portal and takes payment and before he knows it he is the proud new owner of a USB wireless card.So the client calls in because he has the wireless card and needs help setting it up. So we try to walk him through hooking up the wireless card but he is being a crotchety old man and uncooperative. So we schedule an L1 to go out, L1 gets there and immediately calls for help and that is where I become involved. Our L1 cant find the USB port on the computer, we talk on the phone I try to walk them through numerous things to try and nothing. So we start talking and discover its an older computer and that we cant use the ethernet port on it because it was damaged when someone successfully plugged a USB wireless card into it. L1 and I continue to troubleshoot when they mention how slow the old computer is, and I casually ask ""well what version of windows is it?"" thinking maybe its running vista and needs a bit of memory.  So we poke around a bit and the menus they are describing sound wrong to me, the options aren't lining up with any version of windows that I am used to, so I ask ""hey it isn't a mac is it?""  It was not a mac.We eventually determined that the machine has no USB ports, as it not only predates wifi, it predates the USB port and was running windows 3.1.

TLDRStory 1: Incompetent onsite tech incurs the wrath of a nutjob and an eldritch entity, and gets fired for his trouble.Story 2: Museum pieces are not future proof.","A pair of tales, one of customer service, one of technical weirdness",0

"First things first: I'm on mobile and English is not my first language.

Most important: My grandma is not to blame for anything.



The setting. 

My grandparents are living in the apartment below mine. 
They grew up in a strongly rural environment and never got used to electronics in any form.
With time, they learned how to use a TV remote and a cordless telephone, but they just know, how to do the stuff they need: turning it on, changing channels, calling someone and accepting incoming calls. Nothing more. 



Story one: Rechargeable?? 

After a long day at work I entered the staircase of our home. I haven't even yet closed the front door, as my grandma stuck her head out of her apartment.

GM: Hey ME, my phone is not working.

Me: what's the problem?

GM: It does recharge, but turns off, after a few minutes.

Me: How old are the rechargeable? (let's go with this, for rechargeable battery packs. You'll see why)

GM: Grandpa changed them two days ago.

That was the moment my inner alarm bell started ringing.
My grandpa had a little business of changing batterys in neighbors and family's watches. And also held a stock of batteries. Non-rechargeable-batteries...


I took the (slightly to warm) phone off its loading station and opened the back, just to find a pair of batteries.

I took them out, told my grandma to put the old rechargeables back in, while I order a new pair for her.



Story two: sticky situation

I was sitting in the living room of my grandparents, chatting about the day, when suddenly the TV turned off.

Me: what was that?

GM: oh. That happens a lot. Sometimes the TV does strange things, or doesn't do anything when pushing buttons on the remote.

Well, at least one useful info. The remote is having a problem.

I took it of the coffee table and instantly noticed how sticky it was.

Me: what happened to your remote?

GM: Nothing

I gave her the ""we both know that that's a lie"" look.

GM: a glass of juice fell over...

I took the remote, removed the already corroding batteries and pried open the chassis.
The PCB got its part of the juice and also had begun to corrode.

Me: it is dead, Jim.

GM: who is Jim?





Story three: Ghost calls

After a long day at work I enter the house and got cached by Grandma.

GM: someone called me.

Me: Who?

GM: I don't know. It was at midnight. But my phone sounded different.

Me: okay, let me get my notebook and I'll have a look.

Ten minutes later I was sitting at the kitchen table, my notebook in front of me, logging into the isp provided home router.
I checked the phone history, but didn't find any calls that night.

Logged out and closed the imaginary ticket.

Wouldn't been the first time, she heard ghosts.


Next day, same scene.
My Grandma told me that at midnight her phone was ringing and sounded different.
Out of curiosity I offered to take her phone with me, to check who is calling at midnight.

The moment I held the phone in my hand, I saw the problem.
In the left lower corner of the display was a little picture af a little alarm clock.

Somehow my grandma managed to activate the alarm with its default time of 12 o'clock midnight.
I deactivated the alarm and called it a day.",Storys from Grandma,0
"A quick story to pop my TFTS cherry. This happened a few months back when I worked for a semi truck dealer supporting 9 shops across 2 states. Work ranged from typical help desk support to driving out to different shops to do network installs. 

$user is a 70-80 year old parts specialist, only computer literate enough to do his job.

$user stops by the IT office to complain that he hasn't received email all afternoon. Typically back parts specialists receive emails from technicians requesting parts that they bring to the counter for the tech to grab and install in the truck they are working on, which happens pretty frequently all day. He's irate and is bitching about how he needs to get parts out to the techs and he can't do his job because the email is down.

Strange since I haven't heard anyone else in the company (200+ people) complain about the email being down. I've been emailing people all day. Maybe his Outlook client is acting up? $user is known for clicking anything and everything on his screen breaking things that I didn't even know could be broken. I walk with $user to the parts counter to see what the problem is. 

I see nothing out of the ordinary, internet us up and Outlook is connected and online. He hasn't received an email since about 12:30 P.M. which is weird since it was about 3:00 P.M. and usually the parts counter is pretty busy. 

I run back to the IT office and quick send him an email to see if he gets it or if I get some sort of message. I go back to the parts counter and see that his Outlook received the email. I then tell the other parts worker to send $user an email. A few seconds after the other worker sends an email and it goes through on $user's PC. 

$user hasn't received emails all afternoon because nobody sent him anything. 

&gt;$user: Ohoho well thanks for the help! Guess I'll be patient next time! (No apology for being a dick 2 minutes beforehand)

&gt;$me: Haha yep no problem let me know if you have more issues (please don't)

I head back to the office and debate if IT is really what I want to be doing for the next 40 years of my painful existence. Still in the field so it hasn't broken me yet.",You're not as popular as you may think.,0
"Not my story, this one was from my uncle.

He works for a telecommunications company, an old one  that is seldom seen anymore. 

Back when the phones in your home were owned by the telecom a lady was having an issue where many phone calls were not coming in. The phone would not ring, BUT when the phone did ring the dog would howl first.

A lineman (technician using modern terms) was sent out to investigate. He arrived and checked the wiring.  That looked ok. He pulls out his field phone and dials the house phone. No, ringing... Then the dog howls and the house phone rings.

He goes around and finds the dog. The dog was chained to the grounding stake. The groundingb stake was no in the ground far enough AND the earth was a bit dry. 

See where this is going?

The dog would was sometimes getting shocked and would then urinate completing the circuit. This was uncomfortable to the dog and it would howl, BUT the phone would ring.

He never told me how it got remedied, just what the tech had found.

.....

If this is folk lore,  I apologize, this was the story as best as I remember being told to me by my uncle  back in the mid to late 90's.

I have personally been subjected to various voltages,  line power (120v ac in US), electric fences, and various other errors while troubleshooting live electrical components. Yes, the stuff I could check while it was powered down, I would other stuff needed to be on during testing. 

No, I never did voltage test on a phone line.",My dog knows when the phone will ring.,0
"Hey all, long-time lurker, first time poster, so be gentle.

I work for a secret agent themed service department for a large electronics retailer in North America and get a cross of in home service customer service and basic Tier 1 Troubleshooting of Home Theater system (I know it's not computers, but hope this is allowed here).

Had the $Client call in one night reporting that his Vizio TV would turn itself back on almost immediately after he turned it off.

I went through basic troubleshooting with the guy (you know, ""have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in"" and a google search for known issues), he told me he did his own research and called the manufacturer, saw an isssue where the CES would do that sometimes - disabled it, still having an issue.

At this point, I could have offered our paid in-home troubeshooting service, because we are just supposed to offer basic troubleshooting, and he was outside of his warranty, but I was curious, damn it.   Started going through some of the less-likely culprits:

\*IR interference-Remove batteries from all remotes in room in case something was sending an errant IR signal, still turns back on.-Checked for sunlight shining onto IR receiver, nope - not near a window and happens at night/dark room as welll.

\*Checked for another device causing electromagnetic interference (stretch, I know); no devices right near IR receiver.

Keep searching on google while talking to him, and I come across a post by u/HankyDoodleDandy, he had the same issue  on a different model of TV and shared his solution with the good people of r/VizioTV.  Turns out the dang ECO mode on the TV turns it back on after turning it off, client is happy because now he can remove a poltergeist from the issues he has to deal with, and I feel pretty satisfied.

Shared the solution with our team that manages our knowledge base and now I'm on a new committee at work, which doesn't really mean much from what I've seen so far.

"To give a bit of background on this story, I used to work on the Help Desk at a CRM software company and I now work as a DBA at the very same company. I wanted a side-gig for some supplemental income and I decided to take up teaching part-time at my alma mater, a university. My mentor warned me that there were some real characters when you take this type of job up and boy were they not joking.

&amp;#x200B;

I have patience, really I do, but sometimes you just run into someone that you can already tell is going to make your life difficult. I look back on my time as a student and well.. I've done stupid things and its never your fault, right? Always the instructor's, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

This story kind of skirts the boundary, but I did have to do a bit of digging and kind of help someone figure something. out. When you're a teacher or instructor in the C.S./I.T. discipline you kind of are at your student's only form of tech support whenever they have an issue with an assignment. Oh, did I mention that the majority of the students in that class aren't even in any STEM majors? That's important to keep in mind while reading this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, there I was, it was a rainy summer day and I was coming in to class getting ready to teach the ~~bunch of souls who are just thrilled to be here~~ looked like they needed a few shots of the delicious brown IT nectar known as coffee. 

&amp;#x200B;

The class itself was a Microsoft applications course, specifically Access and Excel. We happened to be on the Excel portion of the course and this student was one of the ones who was super-confident because their family was a bunch of accountants who used Excel all the time! So, naturally they didn't show up never shows up for class because it was too easy.

&amp;#x200B;

The due date for the assignment had just passed and I had spent the hour before time grading various assignments and getting caught up on some of the course-work. I hooked up my laptop and opened up my materials and started going about my business while others wandered in. During the lecture, my phone chimes and I take a quick peek to see a message from said student, who again is not in class. I ignore it and continue lecturing for at least an hour after that message came in and helping students out with the daily in-class tutorial.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, two more messages come in during that time, but the only indication is that my phone vibrates and I again ignore it. Class adjourns in the evening after a total of about 2 1/2 hours and I head home after having chatted with one or two others who had questions. I get in to stare at my phone and, of course, it's from a student who's not doing so hot. So the messages come in something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Student: (Message 1) **WHY DID I GET A ZERO ON THE ASSIGNMENT?!?!?! I COMPLETED ALL THE STEPS AND I EVEN TURNED IT IN ON TIME?!?**! *long paragraph trying to justify why they should get full credit because they totally did the assignment*

&amp;#x200B;

Student: (Message 2) **DID YOU EVEN OPEN THE FILE?!?! I KNOW I TURNED IT IN!! HERE'S THIS ASSIGNMENT ATTACHED!** *I get two excel files in the mail and more trying to justify it*

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my policy on this kind of stuff is that you're not supposed to turn things in via e-mail unless I specifically ask you to. This worked before and without issue up until this point. They didn't even ask if I would accept it if they turned it in this way. What's more, it's' written on the syllabus as such, but who the hell reads that, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: So, I couldn't open your file which means I can't grade it so, that's an automatic zero. Normally, I don't accept files via e-mail so the fact that you sent it to me should mean that I don't accept it. If you want to turn it in via e-mail, I'll take it but it's going to have a late penalty.

&amp;#x200B;

I hit send, take the file and get slapped with about 3 more messages worth of ranting about how it's not fair, he should get full credit, etc. etc. To make matters worse about their e-mail submission, I don't even know which file is which, so among all the ranting, I have to send another e-mail asking which is which, to which I get a surprisingly calm and not caps-ridden response. Just to humor them, I open the original submission and, sure enough Excel can't open the file.

&amp;#x200B;

I open it the e-mail submission, compare it to what I'm expecting, post the grade and move on with my night. They must have been watching his e-mail for that notification and gone to check his grade, because within minutes of me posting it I get ANOTHER e-mail:

&amp;#x200B;

Student: **WHY DID I GET 50%, I TURNED IT IN TO YOU.** *more long ranting about how it's not fair, he's going to the Dean, etc. etc. I gave other students credit for turning it in via e-mail*

&amp;#x200B;

Student: *another message saying he paid money to buy software to do the assignment, oh woe is me, etc. etc.*

&amp;#x200B;

Me: You turned it in yes, but **I COULD NOT OPEN YOUR FILE** How is it fair to everyone else who did it correctly and turned it in on time that you get full credit? And you should be happy I'm giving you ANY credit. Look, this is what I get when I try *screenshot showing an error message from excel* As for giving other students credit, I **GAVE** them permission to do that. *Emphasis mine*

&amp;#x200B;

This is my final message of the night. I turn in after waiting 20 minutes for another message and getting no response.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day at work, early in the morning, I get another chime on my phone.. It's them, *UGH*.

&amp;#x200B;

Student: *Makes one final attempt, saying it's not fair and that they asked some staff members and students and they agreed it was unfair of me, etc. etc. The message is pretty long and it asks me to explain myself*

&amp;#x200B;

Out of curiously, I go back to the submissions and just double check. I noticed one difference from all the others... So I check my computer and--wait a second I've seen this! I open an Excel file on MY computer and sure enough... I see what happened! I had hidden files and folders on as well as show extensions from troubleshooting my own problem a few days ago. So, I respond. I also bring up something they mentioned during the previous night's rant after reading through all the messages.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: As I said last night, you turned it in, but it's incorrect so I cannot give you a grade as it's unfair to everyone else, but what you turned in is the file lock, which Excel can't open *provide helpful screenshot pointing out the difference* You may want to be more careful next time.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only had they turned in the Excel file lock, but they did the work on a Mac, which for an Excel and Access course is probably ill-advised. We can see WHEN you log in and WHEN you turn things in. They turned it in right at the cusp of the deadline expiring. 

I can only speculate, but I imagine that there was some setting on showing hidden files that was on and in their rush they probably just turned it in without double-checking. Whoops! Maaaaybe you shouldn't have waited so long and maaaaybe you should've sent a message before turning it in, but I guess Excel is too easy, huh?  


Boy am I glad they don't work with me.

"Hey all. I work as frontline tech support for a SaaS company in the midwest. We handle accounts all over the US and talk to everyone from business owners to ""IT people"" to actual IT support. We help guide these gentle souls through the hell that can be our software when it fucks up. Mostly.

So yesterday was my first day back after a week off to get married. I knew I should have taken that extra day.

Amid the usual ""How do I do this?"" and ""Is chanting supposed to be coming out of the speakers when I log in?"" came Bill (not his real name, I just don't like most Bills). Bill is a gearhead and not a PC guy, he assured me. A lot.

Bill got an error when trying to load our software up. I remote in and see the error. The data folder that the software is using has been moved from the default place where it was supposed to be. It's a simple fix though. I rerun the setup software from the server where the data lives on the client and in five minutes I'm done and thinking about buying a sweet HP DeskPro for my work-from-home PC again.

Slight hiccup. Bill doesn't know the Windows user name and password. Of course, no one in the shop knew them and the kid who set it up in the first place no longer works at the shop. I need that to get into the computer where everything lives and Bill can't help me. After explaining (*slowly*) to Bill what is needed from him, local IT, and the gods above, I send him on his way with ""cust was g2g.""

20 minutes later.

I am on a call with a really sweet lady who wasn't able to merge a couple of work documents together when I get an message from another tech. While watching the sweet customer marvel at the fact that she can merge documents, I look at the message. To paraphrase:

""Hey Nilmandir, I got bill on the line. Did you want me to follow your wording on this with the customer?""

I looked at the ticket number and sure enough it was Bill. I told the tech what I told Bill, contact local IT or Microsoft for assistance and then call us back when you are able to get into the server with a valid UID and password. We can't do anything with our software until they can log in.

Tech thanked me and went on his way. I can hope that 's the last we hear from Bill, but I doubt it.

Side Note: He had called in the day before because of the same issue, but we couldn't remote in because he could not figure out how to set up the remote. It literally is open a browser, go to the website, enter the access key, run the software that automatically downloads, and you're done.

M: Betty that's not how the internet works. Look, lets try your email. Click right here and type (insert email service).com and then hit enter.

she types it in and it immediately pulls up her email because she is already logged in.

M: Lets try opening one of your emails, click on this one.

she clicks on it, and again...

B: SEE?!!? IT. IS. NOT. WORKING!!!

M: Ok Betty. I'm not really sure why its not working, maybe your computer just needs a rest and it will go back to normal in a couple of days, sometimes updates cause problems but then they fix themselves.

B: Really? So if I leave it alone you think it will go back to normal?

M: yup, just give it a couple days, and if it doesn't go back to normal give us a call.

B: oh, ok. thank you for helping me.

M: Your welcome Betty, have a nice day.

me: You right click somewhere, and select ""new folder""

2.) Click ""new folder""
3.) Rename ""new folder"" to whatever you like.

"This story happened about two years ago back when i haven't discovered the wonders of Reddit and this sub. At that time, i was working as a 'lab assistant' at my college, that is, being responsible for a computer lab operation and general sys-admin stuff around the department, which included helping teachers and admin staff around computer-related issues.

 So, one day, a CS teacher asks me to help her with printing compendiums for her course. Compendium was made as a 54 or so page A5 brochure, which means that in order to print it you have to arrange these pages on an A4 paper sheet in a very specific pattern. Not a problem, since Word should've taken care of this thing automatically. Then, she gives me two documents, both with paper size set to A4 landscape, and both containing the same compendium, with the difference being that one had all the text on the right side of the document, and another had everything on the left side. Completely bewildered with this level of shenanigans coming from a CS teacher, i ask her what this setup was supposed to be.

 At this point i need to give a brief description of this teacher: full Caren haircut died black, notoriously irascible, with a catchphrase translating to pretty much 'i will piss off *everyone*', and inexplicably both lacking in her own subject and certified highest category teacher. She gives me a similar brochure that was printed the year before, and proceeds to show me, that i should open a previous year's brochure, find which page number is printed on which side of the A4 sheet and print it from the corresponding document, *one page at a time, for each out of a classrooms' worth of compendiums.* The thing is, judging by the state of the documents, the poor soul that was lab assistant the year before me had most likely went through this exact procedure. Even though i outright refused to put myself through such a torment, i spent about a week afterwards fixing the document and testing Word print settings. Among things that i had to fix were: manually numbered pages, indentation with spaces, page breaks made out of line breaks, pictures, that were placed over a bunch of line breaks and centered manually to fit in text and probably some other things that i do not remember.

 What was the reason for printing a new set of materials at all? From this year on, curriculum (which was made entirely by her) included lab assignments on *using Skype and Windows Movie Maker.* At the very least, i've got a sweet bit of gratification out of pointing to her a page in her own compendium that described all those things that i wasted no less than four hours fixing in her document.

PS: I hope that the text is still readable in spite of my probably less than ideal translation for most of the job titles and such. If you have any questions, i would try to answer them in the comments.

"Get a call from a restaurant because the POS is running slow as hell. I get in and check all the normal things; hub failure, etc etc. I then go to look at the server for these machines (this is 13 years before iPad and cloud POS became a thing).


Get on the server and it is fucked. Slow as molasses in an Antarctic winter. I walk into the room where the server was and I saw it. 4 Italian restaurant sized bags of flour on the rack above the server. I shut it down and pop the top. There was an inch or more of flour in EVERYTHING. Coolers, power supplies, the works.


I call the owner back and show him the situation. Apparently no one had ever told him that was a bad idea. I vacuum it out and then take it out back to a tire shop (it’s a shopping plaza) and use one one of their compressors to blow the remaining powder out. When I get back they had already moved the flour to another area and were working on cleaning out the room.


I hooked everything back up and the guy was super apologetic. Technically I should have billed him for it, which would have triggered upping his service contract cost, but instead I got a $200 tip (much cheaper than his expected cost) and I “swapped” a hub out as the culprit.

"So back in about 1984 we had an insurance system running on a Digital (DEC) VAX cluster in the Adelaide CBD (I worked for an OEM who wrote the insurance system software).

Every Friday evening the system would crash/reboot around 6:00pm.  In fact the customer scheduled no significant work load at that time (i.e. delayed the day/week/month over night processes).  I spend quite a few wasted Friday's on site trying to find out what was going on.  I'd rather be home, out socially, or pretty well anywhere else at 6:00pm on a Friday.

We worked with the DEC engineers to find a root cause, eventually tracked to a major power spike at that time (power monitoring).  Some additional power filters/cleaners (expensive) were installed and the problem mitigated.  But the root cause of the specific weekly big power spike eluded us.

Why would the power spike at exactly the same time every week?  Hmmm?

A few months later, having dinner with some friends, and one of them (Kris) works for a big local daily newspaper (now part of Murdoch, Adelaide locals know the newspapers). We are just chatting about work and stuff and I mention the power spike as a curiosity.  (Turns of the newspaper office building adjoins the insurance company building.)

So I ask Kris if they do anything at 6.00pm on Fridays? He thinks for a moment, ""Yeah we do a weekly fail-over to the backup power system to make sure it works.""

A little more investigation and it also turns out that the two building share the same power sub-station.

BINGO!! Root cause found!

When I relayed this back to our office, the customer, and the DEC engineers, everyone felt better that they knew why.

"I work for an MSP and this call happened to me on Tuesday: 

The contestants of this story are:

$me: me, working as an ""IT-Consultant"" though I do everything for my customers from support to consulting.

$customer: young person, not really tech-savy, works for an architectural bureau we support.

Sometime around midday my phone rings. My colleague has $customer in the line for me. She tells me $customer has some issues with a temporary profile.

$me: *usual greeting and asking what I can help with*

$customer: When I log in I get a message that I am working in a temporary profile and I have to set up Outlook again and all of my browser favorites and local files are gone.

$me: Allright I will quickly connect to your computer and see what I can do. 

I connect to her system, log in with a local admin account and open the registry to find the key that refers to her profile with .bak at the end. There is around 15 keys for different profiles but not a single one that ends in .bak. and not a single one that contains a string with $customers username.

$me: So I can't seem to find a key that contains your username. Is this your first time using this computer?

In the meanwhile I check the C:\\Users\\ directory and try to delete the folder of the temporary profile.

$customer: No I have been working on this system since January

In the exact moment she had answered me,  I reached the users folder and saw a list of ""Temp.domain.local"" folders. At first I saw 10, then I kept on scrolling and scrolling and scrolling... There were 30, 50, 70, 100, and when I reached the bottom there were 125 of them. I slowly started to realize what must have happened here...

$me: So uhh... You said you have to set up your profile again every time you log in. For how long have you been doing this?

$customer: Well I did this everyday since I started working here. At first I found it weird but I thought everybody does this every morning when they start working.

$me: You really set up your Outlook and shortcuts and stuff everyday for seven months?

$customer seemed a little embarrassed at this point, but she handled it well.

In the end what caused the issue was, that my colleague who created her profile, put in a profile-path in her AD account, even though they don't even use server-stored profiles and he even put in their old long decommissioned SBS server as the path. Probably because he cloned an old, disabled profile. After I removed the profile-path from her account, everything worked fine and $customer was no longer logged in with a temporary profile.",Six months of temporary profiles? Why not?,0
"Hello, this is my first post on this subreddit, so I will do my best to make this both detailed and entertaining to read while remaining true to the story. If I can improve my posting skills in any way, please let me know in the comments.

Backstory: I work for a mid-sized finance company in the Central Midwest as a Service Desk Technician. My job responsibilities include desktop hardware and software support, which consists of performing password resets, triaging software issues, moving equipment between desks, etc.

Story: Within the past few months, we recently moved our HR department into a new suite within our office building in order to accommodate for a Mother's Room (required by State law), a new HR Meeting room and allow for better confidentiality for the HR staff and employees. As part of the move, the Director of HR received a new PC and other desktop equipment including a 34"" curved monitor, wireless solar keyboard &amp; wireless rechargeable mouse (keyword: rechargeable).

A few weeks ago, the director of HR submits a ticket to our queue, notifying us that their wireless mouse appears to be dead. In their description, they do notice there is a mini-USB port on the mouse, but they indicate that they did not receive the appropriate cable to charge the mouse. The day after the director submitted the ticket, they went on vacation until early August and came back a few days ago. While they were out, they left their office door open so I sent them an email letting them know I was going to enter their office and look into their wireless mouse issue (it is considered common courtesy at my company to email an executive or director if you plan on entering their office while they're gone). I make my way into the director's office and I immediately see the problem; the mouse is indeed dead, but the charging cable is in their office sitting on top of their PC in an open cabinet below where their keyboard, mouse &amp; monitor are installed. I grab the charging cable, plug it into the front of the PC and then into the mouse and the mouse starts charging and working without issues. I mention this to my manager and they just roll their eyes a little bit, but also suggest leaving a wired mouse in their office as a backup in case the mouse dies again. When the director returns, I follow-up with them regarding the mouse and explain to them that there is a charging cable in their office and let them know it was on top of their PC in the cabinet below. They laugh a little bit and said they figured as much. They also mentioned that they were getting notifications on their PC about the mouse battery being low and it should be charged (the wireless mouse is an MX Anywhere 2s by Logitech, which comes with software that alerts the user if the mouse needs to be recharged). I did also let them know I left a wired mouse in their office in case the mouse died again.

"Backstory- I was in the army, working IT. Signal closets get messy over time. The patch cables and premise cables were in sad shape in several closets. Having cables patch into a 110 block, go down to the floor spool up and back into the switch was not cool. It looked sloppy and unprofessional.  I decided that me and a junior tech would come in on a Saturday for closet cleanup. I asked for a volunteer to give me hand and they would receive additional training (along with a day off). I had made up a bunch of one-ended cables (RJ45 on one end only) to plug into the switch, clip off the excess, terminate into the 110 block, make them almost exact length they needed to be. 

This would require notification 3 weeks out, with a 2 week reminder, a one week reminder, and a day-before reminder. I sent out the network alerts reminding users in that location that there will be NO network connectivity on that Saturday from 0900-1700hrs. That meant no email, internet, login access etc (What part of NO internet users don't understand..?).

Saturday 0900hrs. We're there. Materials standing by and cable scissors in hand, clipping out huge chunks of CAT5 cable. We're pretty much done removing the old cable, we had a nice big ball out in the hallway. We start putting in the new cables and terminating them. 

1100hrs- A command sergeant major (the place is a ghost town, yet here's this one CSM), looks at us and walks by without a word.  15 minutes later, he comes out of his office and wants to know where the internet is. ""CSM, did you receive and read the network outage emails I sent 3 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 week and yesterday stating there will be no internet in this part of the building today from 0900 to 1700?"". He grumbled that he did but did not read them, he didn't think they were important. ""Oh.. OK. Well, they were very important"" He grumbles again that he has some very important work to do. ""We're getting the internet up as fast as we can, we should be finished by 1700."" He asked again where the internet was.. I pointed ""In that ball of cable, CSM"". He stormed off, never to be seen for the rest of the day. 

Afterwards, the job was uneventful and we were done by 1600. 

The lesson out of this- read emails with the subject line of  \*\*NETWORK OUTAGES\*\*, especially when it comes your own IT staff.","""Where did the internet go??""",0
"At the call centre I work for, I work in software development and I do user support things between builds since I have a lot of free time. Recently, we upgraded most of our hardware and now must gather the old hardware to return (we rent equipment). We own some of our monitors, and the rentals all have a big sticker on the side indicating such.

$Me, $ES - entitled supervisor, $M - manager

So this was my day over and over again with all our supervisors (who generally get the best hardware)

$Me (To $ES): I've been sent over to do a hardware change since we're returning all the old equipment.

$ES: Okay, let me just save everything to the network drive and shut it off.

*Waits 5 minutes, despite the e-mail notices about this change today*

$ES: All done, I'm going to get coffee while you do this.

*I spend the next few minutes unplugging everything and swapping out EVERYTHING except the phone...when $ES comes back.*

$ES: Wait! You're taking the monitors too?

$Me: Yeah, the e-mail states all the hardware gets changed since we have to return all the rental equipment.

$ES: But I **need** my monitors, they're huge and it makes it easier to see.

$Me: Understandable, but they are rented equipment and due back now. It's not my call, contact $M, it's his.

$ES: I will, but I need you to put the old ones back.

$Me: Look, I have a job to do, and I'm not changing the job spec just because you object. $M is here now, go talk if you want.

*I finish up and return to my office to find $ES arguing with $M. I overhear most of the conversation and get called over to explain what already happened.*

$M (To $ES): We are replacing your screens, but we cannot lend out the same monitors you had since they are leaving.

$ES: That's unacceptable, I want those monitors.

$M: No, you don't get to decide what is unacceptable unless you have my job. Since you continue to be rude, I'll have $Me put the biggest monitors we have on your desk.

$Me: You mean the Dells?

$M: Yup

*I go to retrieve the old Dell monitors we have, which are...not small. They're Dell P973 monitors.*

When $EM saw them, her head darn near exploded. Since then, it's been department policy to give whiners the most reliable equipment we have. When HR heard about it, they all laughed and said it's within co guidelines so they're nothing they can (or will) do about it.

The next few upgrades went about the same way until the other supervisors caught on.",For want of a monitor,0
"Short one that happened yesterday.

I work as a remote Help Desk for 500+ company owned retail stores (among other responsibilities).  A typical task we do is troubleshooting their data line if it goes down for some reason.  Among the first steps we do is power cycling their switch, router and modem.

Yesterday, I get a call and the new-ish assistant manager is in a panic that she cannot take credit cards, a common symptom of the data line being down.  A quick ping test to the router confirms this.  I direct her to the back room and start describing the equipment she needs to unplug.  We start with the switch and then the router, where she interrupts me.  She wants to know how much longer it's going to be, because the customer is getting impatient.  I tell her it'll probably be at least another 5-10 minutes at best and she puts me on hold to tell the customer.

When she gets back, I continue to direct her to find her modem and unplug that as well.  This is where she tells me that it's behind a locked door and cannot get to it.  I'm puzzled to say the least.  While every store's setup is different, the modem is never very far from the router, indeed it's usually right on top of it.  I relay this and she tells me that when she left the back room, the door shut behind her and her key is now locked on the other side.

I pause for a minute to process this.  She tells me that she will have to call someone else to come open the door and will call me back.  I assent and end the call.

A short while later, my ping tests shows the line come back up, so she must have figured it out somehow.",Can't troubleshoot a locked door,0
"I work summers for a small-ish medical supply company that has several locations across the country, but I'm doing in-house tech support at corporate. I've worked a number of different positions at this company, some undesirable, before finally becoming IT this summer, so I'm pretty familiar with how things work around here and I'm glad to finally be doing something that I want to do. My task for this last week before I go back to school is to contact all of our $SalesReps with field laptops and let them know that I will be remote connecting to their laptop and installing our new antivirus software on it. This is also my first time ever using remote connection since I mostly worked on stuff in-house, so I'm excited and slightly nervous since I want to get it done quick and professionally, but I realize that I know what I'm doing and everything is going to be fine.

So I email a few reps and one gets back to me. 

$SalesRep: ""Sure but I'm already using another antivirus and just renewed it. Also I was going to ask $ITBoss to remove McAfee because its so annoying. Online now"".

Alright, so I go to my web-based remote connection site and see two laptops for his branch, both named under our company conventions. One of the laptops is online and the other is offline, so I figure I'm just going to send it on the one that's online and I hit connect. The session boots up and all of a sudden I'm brought to a screen displaying someone in the middle of playing Minecraft.  *What*? This guy tells me he's online and decides to slack off and start a game of *Minecraft*? The user then closes the window of the game and I take control, and check the user and computer name. Everything seems to check out so I'm bewildered and close out of the session, possibly in fear. I run downstairs to ask $ITBoss what I just witnessed.

$Me: ""So I just connected to $SalesRep's laptop and for some reason he was playing Minecraft?? Was I connecting to the right system?""

$ITBoss laughs and shakes his head.

$ITBoss: ""That was probably an older system that $SalesRep lets his kid use. Try creating a session and email him to invite him to the session so you can remote in to the laptop he's using.""

I come back to my workstation and see that $SalesRep sent me an email explaining that the computer I connected to was his old 10 year old desktop thats at his house and he uses as a backup and he lets his kid use it. He connects to the session from his laptop and I complete the install. I email him that he's good to go and to have a nice day and I see he quickly replies.

$SalesRep: ""Oooh one more thing please. Sorry I forgot"".

Of course you did. He goes on about wanting to change his email for some reason or another but as I'm not going to be at work tomorrow, so not my problem!

The rest of the installs I did today went pretty smooth though. No one was playing video games on their work computers, but I wouldn't put it past sales reps if that's what they actually did in their downtime.",Improper use of equipment or a lazy gamer sales rep?,0
"After my [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cn5jyy/the_day_an_overachieving_temp_became_a_detective/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), I had a few users asking to hear about the story I'd alluded to at the end. This takes place during a three month temp role I held working internal tech support for a wealthy international tech company.

During my brief time there, one project I implemented was rolling all 400 employees in my office building from an old MDM (Mobile Device Manager) to the new EMM (Enterprise Mobility Manager). For those unaware, an EMM/MDM allows a company to oversee every aspect of their assets. This could be from enforcing HDD encryption, restricting web traffic, pushing out new company apps, forcing software updates, wiping the asset remotely, seeing what programs are being used, or even tracking the devices’ physical location.

It also handled the renewal of our network certificates; something that tended to break with our old MDM. Wifi/ethernet certs are necessary to even access the internet from inside our office building. So, if some bimbo off the street, somehow made it past multiple security checkpoints, and physically plugged into an office network jack, he wouldn’t see squat. Unless you had an active certificate, you were completely stonewalled.

Back to the ‘forced compliance’. For this project, I needed to meet face-to-face (one-on-one) with the roughly 300 employees that weren’t yet on the new MDM. They had to plug into a very specific (unlocked) port behind my desk, so I could make a few system changes. This would take anywhere from 7min to 20min for the ones that had trouble. To organize this, I created signup sheets in our online community with hundreds of 20 minute blocks staggered every 10 minutes (across a couple weeks) and had employees signup at whatever time worked best for them.

Everyone was contacted via a batch of individual support tickets that I would eventually need to individually close. They were also contacted via internal messenger or other methods for follow up. Most everyone registered for a time slot and over the next two weeks, I was able to manually enroll hundreds of users in our new EMM. These interactions were my bread and butter, allowing me to single-handedly raise my teams KPI that quarter.

Unfortunately, some employees were too busy (ie. important) to respond and a few even missed their scheduled appointments. Most of them were higher up in the company and could have easily terminated me (a lowly temp) if they were feeling temperamental that day. So, with my time frame on the project coming to a close, I got creative.

Going into the old MDM software, I pulled up a few of the users who were ghosting me and experimented on one by expiring their network certificates. Not ten minutes later, that ‘impossible to reach’ employee walked up to our help desk, as he was no longer able to access the internet. “Sure, I’d be glad to take a look at that connectivity issue for you.”

As there was already a certificate expiry issue with the old MDM, no one found their sudden loss of internet questionable; just annoying. More so, once they showed up for support, a member of my team took it upon themselves to enroll the employee in the new EMM. This both fixed the user's problem and allowed my team to confidently say, “this shouldn’t happen again with our new software.”

In the end, the only employees not enrolled were all on PTO or business trips at the time. Once they got back from vacation and realized they couldn’t get on the wifi, they would need to swing by for support anyway. Win win.

I never told anyone what I had done, as I wasn’t keen to get reprimanded, had an employee lost a sale from my actions.

TL;DR: Important employees are too busy for a short one-on-one meeting with me. So I decide to see how they like working without internet access.

"So I thought ya'll might like this story. 
I think it fits here but if it doesn't please just let me know. This story takes place last year in the South of England. Because it was last year it isn't word for word but as close to it as I can remember. 

The players in this story are:

Me, an IT help desk phone monkey. Give out tech support but don't go to physically visit users , calls that can't be solved remotely get passed to our device support team. 

My husband, Mike: device support engineer in the same company I work for - which incidentally, is the NHS. (National health service). 

Angry lady: aka, angry lady. 

Our story begins on a quiet weekday morning. The phone rings and I tingle in anticipation, at the thought of helping another friendly customer. (Lol). 

Me: good morning NHS IT help desk, how can I help today? 

Angry lady: you can get this car moved from outside my house! 

Me: *confused* im sorry, how did you get this number? This is an IT service desk, not a company related to cars. 

Angry lady: there is a sign in the car, and it says if I have any questions about this vehicle, to call this number! It is parked Infront of my house on my private property and I want it moved! Now! 

Important to note: all device support engineers are required to display an NHS parking pass on their car's dashboard, that tells people they work for IT in the NHS, and has the help desk number on it. The reason for this is that most hospitals charge to park in now, and this prevents the engineer getting ticketed. Mostly. I start to think this is a little weird, as engineers are not allowed to make home visits to staff that need support, they have to meet at their closest NHS building. Because network. 

Me: ok no problem, sorry about that. If I could take the car's registration, and find out what's going on. 

Angry lady: gives me car registration 

About three letters in, I realise this is my husband's car. 

Me: ok ma'am, just to confirm, can you please advise the make and model of car? (She does so, it's Def. Ours). 

Me: great thanks. And can I please take your address, so that I can advise the engineer in question. 

She gives the address. She is our next door neighbour. Complaining that we have parked outside her house. On a terraced street. Where there is no allocated parking and everyone parks wherever they like/can/wherever there is a space. 

I take a contact number, and promise to phone her back with an update. 

I call husband, who confirms that when he got home from work last night there were no other spaces on the road. He is not blocking her in (she does not have a drive way) and our road is not permit parking meaning any member of public can park there, and there are no restrictions, save some double yellows at junctions. 

I check with business support manager, asking how she wants me to handle a member of the public, angry about a car parked by her house, that happens to be driven by someone who works for the NHS. She tells me to go to town and do what I like. Excellent. 

While having this conversation, angry lady phones back and shouts at my colleague so loudly I can hear it through his headset. I ask him to transfer the call to me. 

Me: good morning, I was just about to call you back! 

Angry lady: about time when is this car getting moved from my property? 

Me: well actually, I've spoken to the engineer in question, who advised he lives on that road, so he would be entitled to park there....

Angry lady: it's outside MY HOUSE! ON MY PROPERTY! IT HAS TO BE MOVED NOW! 

Me: I'm very sorry this is causing you frustration. As I've explained to you, the viehicle is parked on public land, by a resident of that street  you have phoned an IT help desk for the NHS and as your call is not IT related, I need to end it so that I can free up the line, so that I may support doctors and nurses who are trying to treat patients. 

I hang up on angry lady. I would like to say the story ends there but she calls back and shouts at 4 more people. 

So. In light of this. I contact the council, give them the address, and ask them to please confirm if the resident of any property is entitled to park outside that property and demand others move Thier cars. 

They email me back, confirming it is a public street, anyone can park there, nobody is 'entitled' to park outside their house, and as long as no driveways are being blocked, nobody can be asked to move their car. 

I print the email. When I get home I post this email through her door. Husband's car was still there.",MOVE. YOUR. CAR.,0

Eww - Entitled whiny worker

SA - my manager

&amp;#x200B;

Until a year ago we had 2 types of monitors, a 20 inch 16x9 LCD and a 10 year old 17 inch 4x3 ugly looking ones. We replaced all the 4x3s and put in 21 inch ones, but kept the 20 inches'. The department decided that unless there's a doctors note we will not move the monitors just because someone changes desks, which happens about 30 times a month, as well as people that beg for their newer monitors to move with them as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was moving this lady's voip phone to her new desk, which already has a full setup with 20 inches.

Eww: ""Can you also move my monitors?""

me$: ""Sorry someone else was put at your old desk, he has those monitors now. Plus we only move your phones when you switch desks, all other hardware stays. It wouldn't be fair to the other people with the 20 inches""

Eww: ""But I have bad eyesight and can't see anything on this""

I hear this all the time and this girl is young, no glasses/contacts, AND it's a small AF difference between the two sizes so I know it's bull.

me$: ""Well I can change the resolution to make everything bigger.""

Eww: ""No it'd be easier to just give me my old monitors"".

&amp;#x200B;

An hour later there's a ticket from her manager asking to swap them out. I contacted him and told him the reasons we won't and he was good. Closed the ticket.

Another hour goes by and there's a ticket from the floor GM. She personally went to him and then I told him the same thing. Closed the ticket.

&amp;#x200B;

Later I see her on the way to the bathroom

Eww: ""I can't work, I need you to give me the newer monitors.""

me$: ""Look, I'm sorry. My manager told me to not swap anything but the phones. Plus we don't have the adapters to put those monitors on your PC model."" (monitors had vga and DP, PC had vga and dvi. Had no dvi-DP adapters.)

Eww: ""What's your manager's extension?""

&amp;#x200B;

Later on my manager told her the same thing. Over the speakerphone he had her on I heard her yell, ""Then I'm taking you to HR!"" SA then called HR and warned of someone that might me angry coming their way, and explained we'll need a note to do what she wanted.

Some time goes by and HR calls up my manager.

HR: ""Look, she said she doesn't want to get a note and we really don't want to have to deal with her, can you please just do it?""

SA: with a sigh, ""I guess. Hey me$, go ahead and switch the monitors.""

&amp;#x200B;

So later that day, I go out and spend 45 minutes imaging a compatible system at her desk just to swap out the monitors and of course, she gets mad that she can't work because ""she has urgent things to get done"". As I'm doing so I get asked by another person with 20 inches to have her monitors swapped for the newer ones. I just say no, without the explanation I gave Eww.","""Then I'm taking you to HR!""",0

"It was bright and early on a Tuesday. We’d met our new tech a few days earlier and he seemed like a solid guy, but today was his first real day on the helpdesk. We spent a while getting him set up and showing him our environment, but after a few minutes, it was obvious that he wasn’t going to need much help. This was a relief as I’d spent the past six months training a revolving door of contractors and temps, and I was sick of climbing the learning curve with someone new every day.



The phone rang **ER POWER FAIL** and it seemed like as good a time as any, so I told him to take the call and I’d help him through it. Formal training is for other people... 



We’ll call the new guy m8 since he was a Brit amongst a bunch of rednecks and hippies and his accent stood out so much that, for a while we were accused of outsourcing our IT.

In “terrible EMR land” where error messages never mean what they say, that means incorrect password. So, I told him, just unlock her AD account, maybe change her password. Easy peasy.

&gt;Me: *fairytale unprofessional server name*


I’m giggling for joy inside. Some of the temps were BAD. This guy knows what a DC is. Thank GAWD. I might have a little training related PTSD. Or not. *twitch*


He RDCs into the domain controller, unlocks her account, and has her try it again. I would have used RSAT tools instead, but hey, the end result is the same.


&gt;NASCAR: It ain’t workin. You need to fix it, we’re busy and I ain’t got time for this sh!t

&gt;m8: Very sorry, let me change your password and we’ll try it again

&gt;m8: OK, your temporary password is 123456

&gt;NASCAR: YOU CHANGED MY PASSWORD? I DIDN’T WANT YOU TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD. I CAN’T REMEMBER THIS STUFF

&gt;m8: Very sorry, but that’s the only way we can solve this particular problem. Go ahead and try it

&gt;NASCAR: OK, do I type in *nonsense* or 123456?

&gt;m8: Type in 123456 and it will ask you to make up a new password

&gt;NASCAR: BUT I DON’T WANT TO MAKE A NEW PASSWORD, I JUST WANT IT TO WORK

&gt;m8: Unfortunately, m’am, that’s the only way I can solve this problem. Are you able to chart with the new password?

"My hospital is working on upgrading all our Windows 7 computers up to Windows 10. For some this is just a matter of re-imaging, but for about 1200 of them we actually have to replace the hardware. As many of you may know we are very quickly running out of time to do this, and since our helpdesk is currently only 6 people (including the supervisor) we struck a deal with our vendor. They would image and deploy the computers directly to our units, and one of us would just be there to domain the computers, less work for us and a little extra on each computer for them.

So the other day we send one of our guys (pd), who is formerly a programmer, down with the vendor to do a dry run so we can work the kinks out of the process. Pd just needs to show them how to remove the old computer and connect the new one without damaging the furniture, cables, etc. 

Before I go on I should explain that most of our computers are running HealthCast, this means that a non-privledged account is perpetually signed in and staff just tap their badges at a scanner to gain access to the desktop. 

About 10 minutes after we send PD down to the floor our private to the helpdesk rings, so I answer it knowing it can only be one of colleagues who needs something.

Pd: can I talk to boss?
Me: boss is on a call right now, is everything okay?
Pd: everything is fine, I just need to talk to him before I can start this test run.
Me: alright I will put the line on hold and let him know its urgent.

I put the call on hold, and go over to boss. ""Boss, pd is on the line and says he has to talk to you about this test run.""

My boss quickly, less than 3 minutes, finished his call and picks up pd's call

Boss: what's going on?
Boss makes strange choking sounds.
Boss: hang on a sec not sure I heard you.
My boss mutes the line and calls us all over to his desk, once we get there he shushs us and then unmutes the line and puts it on speaker phone. 

Boss: alright can you say that again for me?
Pd: this computer has healthcast and is at the secured screen, how do I turn it off?

At this point the three of us standing by the desk almost collapse in silent laughter. But my boss, to his credit held it together. 

Boss: well there are a couple ways. Tou could tap you badge and use the start menu from the desktop, tou can also press ctrl+alt+delete to get around the secured screen (I personally only learned that a couple weeks ago), either of those should work.

Pd: okay I am through..... it has updates pending should I do those? 

At this point my boss struggled to keep it together.

Boss: we will be disposing of the computers once they are removed, do you think they will need updates?

Pd: alright I got it, thank you.

Boss hangs up.

My boss turns to look at us shaking his head.

"A few moons back, I worked a temp Support Desk role for a multi-billion dollar tech company. Basically, I was covering for another employee's planed three month paid leave. When I wasn't responding to countless tickets or wrecking havoc in Active Directory, part of my role involved asset management; including MDM/DEP enrollment of hundreds of brand new assets each month- mostly laptops, phones, tablets, etc.

Near the end of my short stint with this amazing company, I took it upon myself to inventory the build room and clean up their hodgepodge of databases. Surprisingly, I was able to account for every Macbook listed, with the exception of one. I confirmed it wasn't out in the recent batch of repairs and should have definitely been on a shelf or in a cupboard. Checked again; nope, not there. Odd. So, to appease my OCD and craving for mystery, I decided to investigate.

Using our help desk ticket system, I could see that a company contractor (let's call him Mr. Business) had the asset assigned to him one year prior. I reached out via messaging, where Mr. Business stated that, ""the Macbook didn't work for \[his\] software and \[he'd\] returned it to our service desk the year prior.” While this story lined up with our inventory database, it didn't explain why the asset had never been reassigned and was simply marked as 'retired' the entirety of last year. Very odd. Well, more digging for me.

With the help of our Access Management tool, (I had far too many admin privileges as a temp) I was able to determine that this missing laptop was accessed about 6 months *after* it had supposedly been returned to inventory. I could see what programs were used at that time, how long the laptop had been booted, and what networks were connected. There was also one additional bit of information available; the username of the individual who signed in at boot. A username belonging to our dear, Mr. Business.


He booted it again a few days later, for only a few minutes; making it easy to guess the Macbook had been wiped at that time. Pulling up our network logs, I determined that this asset had not pinged our internal network for around 10 months, which correlated with the unknown IP he had logged.

So, the picture painted was this: Mr. Business, who made well into six figures, borrowed a laptop that (for whatever reason) he failed to return. Instead, he decided to risk his career (well, at least his honor?) by lying about it and bringing the Macbook home with him- where it sat undisturbed for six months. Like a grade A genius, he booted it, connected it to his home wifi, and used it for one day- before wiping its memory.

Mr. Business was in the clear. That is until months later, when some kid decided to be an overachiever in a temp roll and clean up a few databases, trying to leave a good impression. I ended up compiling some irrefutable proof this guy was guilty.

No clue what came from it or if Mr. Business even still works for this company. I passed on what I'd found to my boss and knew better than to ask questions about how it was handled. Wasn't my place.

Anticlimactic, I know. Thanks for reading anyway.

TL;DR: A well paid business man stole a company laptop; then lied to myself and others about stealing it. Bad businessman, bad.

This actually reminds me of another solid story with this same temp job, where I revoked high-level users' network access so they'd schedule meetings for me to 'fix' their computers. Fun times.

"I work for a live entertainment video company, I started as a tech assistant and truck driver and worked my way up to a nice position with an office where I’m constantly testing new gear for new products, and I fly out to fix stuff if needed. Every tech in the company is also a tech support person, including me. 


Typically at a show or install if you have an issue you try to solve it with your own skill set, then you start asking the other techs onsite, then you call other field techs, then you wind up calling me, or one of two other people who know this gear inside and out. I don’t get too many calls these days because we generally have very good techs. When I do gets calls, it’s typically a situation where someone has been hammering away at a problem for hours and they are at the end of their rope.


Several months ago we setup a temporary show that runs for over six months. I flew in after the install techs finished so I could touch up their work and color balance the whole thing. During the run of the show we have some local techs babysitting the gear so they can respond to any immediate emergencies. It’s setup so I can remote in if anything needs to be reprogrammed, and the local guy can be my eyes.


So last week I get a call from the babysitter…


Babysitter: I’m having an issue with the big screen


Me: What’s going on?


Babysitter: It shows the test pattern just fine, but the actual video feed looks messed up


Me: Ok, is it the center hung screen, or the center side screen? (two wildly different products)


Babysitter: It’s the center hung screen.


This product can’t generate it’s own test pattern, so the problem MUST be in a piece of gear upstream, I don’t remember if we have a scaler that can create a test pattern in the signal chain or not, and I wasn’t at my computer, so I couldn’t look up the drawings.


Me: Do you have your personal laptop there? Does it have an HDMI out?


Babysitter: Yes and yes


Me: Ok, plug your laptop into the processor and tell me what you get on the screen


Babysitter: Ok, I’ll try to find a cable.


I hear some stuff being moved around int he background, then this…


Babysitter: Hey, do you think I should try turning it off and on again?


My head just about explodes, he should have tried that LONG before grabbing his phone


Me: Yes, definitely try that!


Then I hear him flip breakers. He didn’t power cycle the processor that was acting up. Nope. This chucklefuck power cycled our entire setup, twelve jumbotrons and all of our production gear! Fortunately everything came back online just fine, including the processor that was acting up. After confirming that everything was fine I instructed him to ONLY ever power cycle the gear that is acting up, and to ALWAYS do that before calling anyone. 


I don’t know this particular tech, but I hope he was just having a bad day and that’s why he called before doing the basics that every other tech starts with. Usually a tech has already power cycled gear, factory reset it, swapped out gear, and so on, long before I get a call. I made the mistake of assuming he had already tried that stuff, my bad.

TL;DR: I forget to check if he had power cycled the gear that was acting up.","This time, I forgot about the basics",0

"Thought I'd post an uplifting tale of success for you to enjoy. This one was my biggest success working on equipment that was literally old before I was even born. So I was trained to work on equipment that handled communications for ships. Nothing super fancy, basically it connected radios to antennas for various operations. Since these were Marine haulers we'd have a dozen or so different commands with their own setups. I was lucky in that I got turned around out of my schooling to become maintenance at said school. So after spending months learning on broken down crap it bcame my job to make it work for the next few dozen classes and I jumped into it hard.

Now when I say old I'm talking just after transistor invention old. No fancy ICs here, we had ""cordwood modules"". These things:

https://i.imgur.com/B7tWVqA.jpg

The machine I was working on had been broken for decades and I decided I wanted it to work. On top of having ancient tech, literally hundreds of those little boxes and each one was a gate. XOR, OR, AND each a little box of discrete components with hair thin wires running all over the place.

https://i.imgur.com/hZBInpg.jpg

We also had ALD or Automated Logic Diagrams for it all from IBM.

https://i.imgur.com/ZAhhtkh.jpg

So you see, a signal came from another page somewhere on the left, went through whatever gates it needed then went out the right to another page somewhere. They did group things a bit, so the display stuff, power stuff, input stuff would be grouped together but it was also designed by engineers so the ""logic"" part was not always apparent.

So, the deal was, this system had an old monochrome green monitor tied to it that never worked. The teletype worked, the card reader worked, and the paper tape reader worked so that was how they did all their training but in the field they'd have monitors that no one knew how to use.

Shiny new crow on my hat and I jumped in to the display area! And found nothing. Actually I found a few spots where things were wrong but tracing them through dozens of pages I'd find it working earlier on. After weeks of hunting I was literally down to testing EVERY signal on EVERY page and learning ever so much about oscilloscopes. This was in between routine maintenance duties on things like hydraulic disc drives and reel to reel tape drives.

So as I'm digging through signals one night I notice at the bottom of a page a line. It crosses the page from one side to the other with nothing on it.I follow it forward and it ends up eventually in the display area where it loops back. So I follow it backwards and deep in the drive interface logic I find an XOR gate. So I test it. Good signal in, no signal out. Hm.

I go digging and find the module off in the middle of nowhere and get a replacement in which takes forever since fleet has priority.

Best guess? An engineer needed to flop the signal for whatever reason and ran out of XOR modules over in the display section but found an unused one miles of tiny wire away and just looped it in.

Got mad props for getting the system up and running again and learned never to trust an engineer to make sense ;)","Ancient tech story from another former sailor, US Navy",0
"Some background - Started working at my current job about a year ago on help desk, recently promoted to IT Specialist about 4 months ago, while still doing help desk things. This story is from when I was still on help desk. TL;DR at the bottom.

Characters: 
Me = Verbal_A_Saltz  
JM = Jerk Manager, thinks IT should drop what they're doing and help him because any inconvenience prevents him from doing his job  
NG = New girl JM's Assistant, been with the company for about two weeks  
$user=Enter username here

It was a typical day. Trying to knock out all my blocked tickets, but the phone won't stop ringing. We had been getting calls about people trying to access an Excel file ($File) on a network share, only to get an error that ""$user"" had it open, even though ""$user isn't here today"" (can confirm, $user wasn't logged in anywhere, and hadn't logged in in over 24 hours)

Start researching it, find out that there's an issue with this kind of document and network shares, but there's a workaround (but it doesn't work for everyone, and can't remember what it was). Also, find out that even though it says $user has the file open, it's half correct. The file is open somewhere, but $user was the last one to save the file. I don't have a ticket for the issue, so I'm not focusing on it, but I pass on my findings to my co-workers.

Phone rings. It's my turn to answer.

Me: IT, this is Verbal_A_Saltz, how can I help you?

JM: Hey, Verbal_A_Saltz, this is JM. I need to access $File to make changes, but it says $user has it open. (He sounds kinda pleasant, but I know it's about to change)

Me: Yeah, we've been getting calls about this, and we're looking into it.

(Cue his typical behavior)
JM: I NEED IT NOW!

Me: As I said, we're looking into it, and we'll provide an update as soon as we find out more.

JM: This is BULLS**T! I'm sick of calling this line, and you can't even do what your job title says. (Probably about another 30 seconds of him ranting about how much he hates the IT dept). If you can't help me, what can you do?

Me: I can continue looking into this to try and get it resolved.

JM: (back to ranting)
(At this point, I had a random idea on how to find out who had the file open. Open Computer Management -&gt; Connect to another computer ($FileServer) -&gt; Shared Folders -&gt; Sessions. Don't know why I didn't think of it before. See NG has the file open)

Me: I found it! Looks like NG has it open.

JM: No, she doesn't! She's working on something else. (goes on that I'm trying to get him off the phone and argues that I'm wrong)

(While he's ranting, I find out what computer NG is on, and remote into her computer.We use some remote desktop software that allows us to view/control a user's desktop through a web browser. She has FB open, and she's playing some game. I see down in the taskbar, she has Excel open, but it's minimized)

Me: I'm just going off the information I'm finding. If you could go check, we could confirm my information is correct, or if I need to continue looking into this.

JM begrudgingly agrees to go check and puts the phone down. I go back to watching NG's screen. She's happily playing her FB game, clicking here, clicking there. Then all of of sudden, the mouse stops moving for a few seconds. Then it starts to move towards the red X. I figured she was busted, and in my excitement of possibly being right, I accidentally moved my mouse cursor over the web browser, which takes over her screen, and moved her mouse cursor, causing her to miss the red X. The mouse stops moving for a minute. Then I hear JM yelling through the phone, but I can't make out what he's saying, but I'm definitely sure she's busted. Yelling dies down, then the mouse starts moving again. Closes FB, clicks on Excel and viola! NG had $File open the whole time.

Ten seconds later, JM gets back on the phone. No apology, doesn't admit I was right, just says he's all good. Calls finally stop coming in about $File (that day anyways)

A couple days later, I see JM submit a termination request for NG. Not sure why, but always thought that call had played a part in it. JM's boss submitted a termination request for JM a couple weeks after that (not sure why)

TL;DR - Caller can't access a file, I find out is assistant has it open. Send him to go check and he busts her playing Facebook games. She gets fired a couple days after the call",I think I got the new girl fired...,0
"So a manager walks to my cubical saying an account reps email is no longer forwarding to him. The account rep had forward his email to his manager while he went on vacation for the week. ""But I figured out what happened,"" the manager declares. ""Their password expired."" He was talking about the account rep's Active Directory password. 

Me: ""Wait he didn't change it before he went on vacation?""

Our AD users are emailed 10 days prior to the password expiration everyday warning the user that their password is about to expire.

Manager: ""No he didn't""

Me: ""Well, that was kind of stupid.""

Manager: I know. . . . . Can you reset it?

Me: I CAN, but 1. not for sure that will fix the email forward 2. You can not have the new password (against password policy) and 3. this will mess up their mobile access to their email (so we need to contact them with the new password).

Manager: Let's just try it, but I do not think we can reach him. 

Me: OK no problem.

I reset the password, which un-expires the password. Evidently email starts flowing because I do not here back from the manager. I try to call the out of office account rep and leave a voice mail on the only personal number I have. Two hours goes by and then I receive an agitated account rep phone call. Let him know what has happened and give him the new password. ""Wow I didn't think a password expiration was that important.""

Me: Yeah, that is why we send you emails for 10 days prior to it expiring asking you to change it.""

Fast forward 5 days later to today.

Same rep makes it back to work and stomps in my office saying that they can not sign in this morning because their account is locked out. They tried the new password and it does not work. ""You need to reset it now.""

Me; ""Uh, you are not locked out.""

.....two minutes of arguing with me......

Me: ""Oh I see,"" (fake typing) ""Here try it now."" 

He walks back to his desk, tries it and calls me back, ""OK it is working now. Thanks.""

"Back story- In the army working as a computer tech. Windows NT 4.0 and Office 97 time frame. I get a call from the boss (colonel) to go down and load Office 97 on another colonel's computer. Was this story insubordinate? Most likely. Did he deserve this? oooh yes he did.

I go down to the colonel's office to do the software install. I knock on his door and announce that COL. ""cool boss"" sent me down to install Office 97 on his computer. He pauses. Looks me up and down and says ""Where's major ""other cool boss""?"" I tell him that he's busy and can't make it down. The he asks where's COL ""cool boss"".. ""He's busy and he sent me down to do the install"". The colonel thinks about this for a second and says ""I was expecting someone with more rank"". ""Well.. Both are busy. If you like, you can wait a couple weeks to get it installed"" I replied. Being a grouchy old colonel, he replies back ""Oh.. Ok... I suppose I can let a sergeant work on my computer"".. He gets up and allows me to sit down at his desk to work the install. I install the package and walk out, report back to the boss it's done and move on.

Fast forward 8 months later..

I get assigned a work order from LTC ""I don't think you have enough rank"". He is moving between commands. He wishes to move his documents down to the computer that he'll be using in his new office. I look at the work order, remember the slam I received and decide to write a nice document up (with color pictures) of how to create a share on the new computer, how to locate that computer on ""network neighborhood"" and how to copy/paste his documents from his old computer to the new one. I send this set of directions back to the good colonel and closed the work order.  A week later, this same work order shows up again. I took the directions I sent him, condensed it down to the ""readers digest"" version, send it back and close the work order. Week later, same work order. Send an email referring to the last two documents and close the work order again.

A couple days later..  I run into the good colonel in the hall way...

""Say SGT.. I submitted work orders to move my documents from my old computer to my new one and they keep getting canceled.""

Me- Sir, did you read the emails and read the documents with pictures and directions to facilitate this..?

LTC- Yes, but it was just complex and complicated.

Me- Sir.. Why is it, a man of your rank, who makes 5X more than I do, who is supposed to be smarter than a lowly SGT, who holds a bachelors degree from university of (insert state), cannot perform something this simple...? Sir, have a great day!

LTC- (catatonic state in hall way while he crunches the data of what just happened)

Me- continue to walk down the hall way and onto my next trouble ticket.

Later, I did stop by my boss's office to inform him of what took place on this particular work order. He just about fell out of his chair laughing.

"Its always a bad day when I see this popup on my teams. ""This lady wants to be escalated."" I take a long sip of my coffee and get up to go use the restroom. I come back and answer him. ""Details and send er over."" 

Lady is using *loan program* to pull pdf files out of *loan program* and into *not adobe pdf* to split them before printing each pdf to pdf, all with the same file name, and re-uploading the split PDFs into *loan program.* Yes... my eye twitched when she printed a pdf to a pdf inside citrix. 

&gt; $Me - Hello this is Al Bundy with *our company* tech support. I am the supervisor. I am hearing you are having an issue and want an escalation?

&gt; $Lady - Yes this is Karen with *our company branch number* I am having an issue with *not adobe pdf* failing to upload files into *loan program*. 

&gt; $Me - Yes *other tech* was explaining this to me, he said it really need to be demonstrated to understand. 

&gt; $Lady - Yes, that is the one thing he was right about on that phone call. 

&gt; $Me - Hmm (Slaps mute button) No he was correct about everything he said about you when he was muted. (Unmutes) Yeah go ahead and show me please and I can see whats happening. 

&gt; $Lady - So I open up *loan program*, download this PDF onto my computer, open it up here in *not adobe*, split each file and then save them. 

By saving, she goes to print and prints the split pdf into pdf using the *not adobe* pdf printer option. She names one file and uploads it back into *loan program* by dragging and dropping it into the file manager and then dragging each one into the folders. 

&gt; $Me - So you split the files, and instead of naming each file separately you are overwriting the files and uploading them into *loan program* one at a time?

&gt; $Lady - Yes. 

&gt; $Me - Ooooookay. I would suggest creating folders in your documents folder for each borrower and then deleting them when you are done. I would refrain from overwriting each file before uploading them and... 

&gt; $Lady - Its not me. Your program must be broken. I don't know how many times I have to explain this. 

I tell her ""one second while I check something"" and mute my microphone. I talk to the tech who handed her over to me and learn she gave him the same spiel. I walk into the break room and grab another cup of coffee. 

&gt; $Me - I checked with the network guys, no one else is reporting an issue with *loan program* so you may be the first one to have this issue. Go ahead and pull up a loan that you need to do this to and run through the steps so I can see where the error happen please. 

&gt; $Lady - You want me to just do one of the files I was about to work on?

&gt; $Me - Yes please. 

She opens up *loan program* and pulls up the megadocument and goes to print. She starts the process of printing a pdf to a pdf. 

&gt; $Me - Want me to save you some time and an extra step?

&gt; $Lady - I love time savers, show me. 

I back out of the printing screen and go back to the file and click ""save."" 

&gt; $Lady - But I need it as a pdf. 

&gt; $Me - Mhmm it is. 

I open up the file in *not adobe* and take tell her to do her thing. She extracts pages 1-3, 7, 9, 12-13, 17, and 20-23 out of the document. 

She runs through the process of saving each set of documents to the same folder named the same thing and uploading them 1 at a time to the *loan program.*

&gt; $Me - You skipped 9. 

&gt; $Lady - No I didn't. 

&gt; $Me - Yeah you did and I will show you. See here you went and changed the file name to *file name* and saved it overwriting the previous file. (Clicking along with her on her PC to show her in the re-enactment.) You then uploaded the file into *loan program* bu forgot to save it. Then you went to the next one and made it the same file name overwriting page 9. You uploaded that one and saved it. 

&gt; $Lady - No I definitely saved it. I know I saved it. I want to talk to someone else. 

&gt; $Me - Ok I will transfer this to my boss, just want to check one thing. 

I open up the file that she did not save and it showed a ""You have unsaved changes"" in the top right corner. 

&gt; $Lady - The 9 page is in there. 

&gt; $Me - Yes but it is not saved. As soon as you close *loan program* and reopen *loan program* you will find that page 9 is gone. 

&gt; $Lady - See this is why you guys are useless. Watch this. 

She may not have actually said watch this. But my brain thinks she did. She closed the loan program by force killing it in task manager to ""prove a point"" and then re-opened it up navigating to the file. 

This next part requires no embellishments. No fabrications. No lies. What happened next is 100 percent what happened to me a few hours ago on the phone. 

&gt; $Lady - Watch I am going go back into the file and open up and see page n..... iiine. Where did it go?

&gt; $Me - You did not save the changes when you were in it the first time and when you closed out of it the changes were not saved. Meaning they were lost. You will need to re-save page nine and re-upload it into *loan program*. To prevent this from happening in the future  you will need to not save each file as the same file name and save them as different file names. You will want to keep the files for a time so you dont have to do double the work. 

&gt; $Lady - Could this be a glitch in the system?

&gt; $Me - No this is just a simple case of user error. 

&gt; $Lady - But what about...

Every single response I gave her was doubled up with a ""But what about?"" response. Finally I just told her it was user error and that she had been given the fix. I apologized but said I had to get back to work and hung up on her. Pulled the call log and sent it to my boss.

"So here's a short follow up from my previous story.  This involves the local network wiring company hired by corporate to put in the new drops as the site was being remodeled.

So my two coworkers and I are on the last week of the remodel.  New paint, new half walls, new carpet and desks.  We're setting up the customer rental computers, printers and other stuff in the newly finished area.  Now since these computer just moved and are on DHCP we haven't had to re-image them or anything, just plug them back in.  Plop Computer 1 down, plug it in, everything shows as online, great!  Computer 2 shows as offline, then 3, then 4 is online, 5 offline.  This repeats as the place has like 10 rental computers.  One printer is online, one isn't.  The large format copier is offline, A copier shows as online but the attached card reader that rings up the copies isn't.  At this point we're all confused.  Tone for connectivity is good.  I go into my toolbag and pull out my cable tester which has the ability to test the run.  Plug cable into one of the problem jacks, repeat at the rack.  All 8 lights blink on the rack side, on the jack side light 3, then 6, then 1 and 2, then 4 and 5, then 7 and 8.  We realize the wiring guys who worked overnight have created cross connects between the rack and the floor.

Talk to the GC, he gives my coworker the number of the vendor.  He calls and leaves a message, emails our boss and whoever at corporate is in charge.  He gets a call back that afternoon, ""We'll be there tomorrow at 7:30am to fix it.""  We all show up the next day at 7, no vendor at 7:30.  Calls to the phone go to voicemail. Repeat on day 3 as well.  Day 4 a guy shows up, at 8:30am.  It turns out he had punched B at the rack and one of his guys did A while the other did B on the jacks.  He then had to check each drop and fix it at the rack (so now that rack has some A and some B).  It took him a couple of hours to check and fix all of the drops.

The whole week my coworker had been documenting and emailing our corporate overlords with the status and what was wrong.  If I remember correctly he forwarded me and our other coworker an email from the PM.  They were renegotiating payment with the wiring company for failing to do their job properly and wasting all of the man hours.  I do remember that they had screwed up another site after the one we were at and the company had them thrown out and replaced with a different vendor.  They were never seen again.",T568A and T568B are the same thing right?,0
"So some time ago before I moved away from my parents city I was considered the ""tech support"" of the family and all of our friends / colleagues.   
Not professionally (like most of you) but as the tech-savvy guy in the family I was the one to call when there were any tech issues ranging from TVs set to the wrong input (with the owner unable to set it back) to completely fucked up Windows problems or internet issues.  

I never complained because I liked doing it, it gave me experience for the career I am starting now and sometimes a few of the people I helped even threw in a few bucks for me.  
But there is one moment I will remember for a while:  

I was doing some stuff, can't remember what exactly, when my father called me in panic telling me I have to go to a colleague of his *right now* because her internet connection is not working and she needs it urgently. I assumed for work.  

When I arrived there not long later I found a grown woman - not kidding - in tears about being unable to access the internet, primarily not work related stuff but social media.  
I always try not to judge people and I know myself how an unhealthy connection to social media can develop but this woman really shocked me, she began throwing stuff and yelling at her child (5 y/o at that time) while I tried to troubleshoot the issue as calmly as possible.

But I couldn't find out what was wrong. The router was connected, cable plugged in on both ends correctly, the internet was reachable from all other devices, I even tried to turn it off and on again. No luck, the windows computer did not recognize the Ethernet connection.  

At that point said woman told me to just call the ISP and let them tell me what's wrong. At first I didn't want to, as this didn't seem like an ISP issue to me but she kept telling me to call so I did.

I was greeted by a nice man listening to my problem and going through a check list with me. I have to admit I was annoyed. I thought I was smarter than this stupid check list. Of course I checked all of these things!

Then we came to the **cable**.
ISP: Is it plugged in?
Me: Yes.
ISP: Are you sure?
Me: Yes, of course. Do you think I wouldn't check that?
ISP: Could you please follow the cable the entire way with your hand?
Me: Are you serious?
ISP: Yes.

So I moved back the desk and did like he said, while feeling smart. 

Then I suddenly felt stupid. 

In my hands I held two ends of a freshly cut Ethernet cable. Turns out the previously mentioned child had access to scissors somehow and felt the need to cut the Ethernet cable.  

And that my friends is how I learned to value checklist troubleshooting and to never think of yourself as too smart.","About children, cables, call-centers and social media addiction",0
"I work as tech support for a company that provides pharmacy automation solutions to hospitals, mainly in the US, but pretty much everywhere in the world as well.

We get calls every day about technical issues, most of them being user errors or oversights, some of them being actual technical issues that we might or might not be aware of but, sometimes, we get a call from a customer who thinks the system is supposed to be specifically tailored to suit their every needs.

PL: Pharmacy lady
M: Me

M: Welcome to the technical support center, what can I help you with today?

PL: Yes, the labels that print out of the Zebra printer at X device are missing information.

M: Okay, what information are they missing?

PL: Well, it doesn't print out the prescription information and the administration instructions.

Now, at this point she has me confused. For the particular type of device that she is printing the labels from, there is no such thing as prescription information. The med orders come in, the user can select an order on a patient's profile, remove the med from the drawer and administer it to the patient. The labels that usualy print on the external Zebra printers, are barcode labels to identify the medication properly. 

There is also an intergrated thermal printer that prints a slip for certain transactions, whether it be a removal, a return or things such as meds that are stocked out or are getting critically low in stock. This can be adjusted individually for each device but, then again, no prescription information.

M: Just to make sure, we are talking about X device, right?

PL: Yes! The nurses remove medications and give them to patients to go home with, but the label doesn't provide the prescription or the administration instructions.

M: But, m'am, the medications that are removed are to be administered by the staff and are not expected to be used to as take-home prescription medications. The system is not tailored for this type of procedure as we do not keep neither prescription information or individual medication administration instructions.

Now, at this point, she begins to get noticeably irritated. 

PL: We had called a couple of months ago for the same thing and they had also told us that you couldn't do it but we think this is unacceptable. You see, we pay for the printer and also pay for its maintenance contract and we expect it to work as we please.

M: I understand, but the system is not designed to hand out prescription and drug administration information. It is designed to automate in-house medication administration and we do not keep any of the information that you want to have on the labels. Plus, the information on the label is hard coded and there is nothing I can do to add or remove any of it.

PL: You can ask your programmers to change it.

With this statement, she was actually serious. She thought that I could just turn around from my desk, shout real loud from my desk to just ""ask the programmer"" to make the change for this machine, as if it was just a question of changing two or three lines of code for a product for which we don't even release a version a year for.

I ended up finding the old ticket she had called for a couple of months prior and the other agent had told her the same thing and even had the product support engineers involved to confirm exactly what I had just told her.

We also have an ""idea portal"" where customers can submit ideas that is about as efficient as you'd expect from something called ""idea portal"". I walked through the procedure of submitting a resquest with her and she asked to be provided frequent feedback about the ""progress"" of the request.

She also wanted to file a formal complaint but I have never heard anything about it since.",What do you mean it can't do that?,0
"I work for the US Navy.
I’m on mobile.
I’m a native English speaker, just can’t spell worth a damn.

I was holding off on posting this till the second part got resolved, we also just got back from a long underway yesterday.

For those not familiar with ship controls, the helm controls steering, the lee helm controls thrust. Both stations are manned up by seamen and Bosun Mates(BM’s) while being supervised by a master helmsman (another BM), helm safety officer, Conning Officer (Conn), and Officer of the Deck (OOD). None of these watch stations have seats and are forced to stand there for the 4 hour watch. That is the origin for both problems.

Story 1: Carpal Tunnel
Due to previous problems with the helm wheel being hard to turn due to watch standers leaning on it, we have to take a torque wrench and test it before getting underway. A few months back, it tested at 40 inch-pounds. That is less force than it takes to turn your steering wheel with power steering, but is considered out of specifications on the high side for our purposes. 

We place a new wheel and some of the assembly on order and was received a little over a week later. We go up to the bridge to replace it.  While putting the new one on, the BM sanding helm looked at us and said something along the lines of “Oh cool, you’re replacing the helm wheel? I was starting to get carpal tunnel from this thing.” The three technicians up there with me, my Cheif, my Divisional Officer, lee helm, Conn, master helmsman, and the OOD all stared like he was an idiot and the ten of us conducted training and corrected the deficiency on the spot.

Story 2: Mind as blank as the screen
The lee helm has no wheel to lean on, so the watch stander leans on the console. Evidently these guys have a fetish for leaning on the power button. There was hardly a day that goes by without us getting a call that the screen went blank. Every time we went up there we got the same variation of “It wasn’t me, it just turned off.” We knew it was BS and told them as much and instructed them not to lean on the screen, they never listened. They kept doing this till it broke, the screen wouldn’t come up to the right channel and the menus controls no longer worked to to the frequency of having to be used. A war was waged between us in Combat Systems, Navigation, and the triad (Commanding Officer, Executive Officer, and Command Master Chief).  We got petty. We placed a new screen on order and replaced it. Guess what happened, the fault followed to the brand new, proven good screen. My division is no longer required to respond for the lee helm screen turning off. As an added bonus, the BM’s now need to build a don’t touch that box to put over the power button so they stop “accidentally” pushing the button.",Helm Hell,0

"A little context: I work as a Onsite MSP guy doing maintenance for a very large CCTV and access control system. 250 cameras and a rack full of storage and servers to run it all. Generally a very robust system, but not today. 


On to the story, TL;DR at the bottom. 


It was a very peaceful day so far, I spent most of my morning getting the ticketing system sorted out and doing some backlogged work. The client (a senior IT sec guy, very cool, very respectable) asks me for the serial number of one of the storage arrays, who had a failed drive after only a month, so we could warranty it. 

I decided to be ~~stupid~~ proactive and take out said failed drive just for a minute to take a picture of the label. So far nothing out of the ordinary right?

As soon as I pulled it out a second red light came on in the drive just next to it. Fuck. This is a RAID 5, so if two disks are gone everything is gone. 

I went into the office to check if the storage was still online, it wasn't. It was after this point that the client could read the despair in my face and I had to explain what happened.

I had to call my boss who managed to get the second bad drive back online and rebuild the entire thing without losing data, all while I finished almost half a pack of cigarettes and was considering restarting my music career. And I learned the most valuable lesson of all, don't touch anything important unless asked. All in all I could go home with a job.

"[u\atleastiamfree's tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cmwe9y/about_children_cables_callcenters_and_social/) reminded me of my time as IT in Print/Copy.  It's not pure IT but we were the ones who got to witness this level of dumb.

I'm helping my coworker with a store remodel.  The store is staying open during the remodel so we have to move computers, copiers, printers around the place so the construction can take place in phases.  As registers are being moved around the security camera company has their guy out moving cameras and getting everything set up.

We come back from lunch and we can hear the camera guy swearing under his breath a bit.  I've known him for years so I go see what's up.

&gt;Camera guy: It's weird, I ran cable and some of my cameras aren't working.  I can see some of them on the DVR but not all of them.  Have you guys done anything?

&gt;Me: That's strange, we've been on lunch so we haven't done anything.

Camera guy starts tracing cables.  He finds that his no signal cameras have no power, which is odd since it's part of the cable he's run.  Then we hear the loud expletive while he's on the ladder above the ceiling tiles.  He comes down, goes marching over to the GC and drags him back in.  Points up to the ceiling and makes the GC go up.

Talking to the camera guy later we found out that while we were on lunch the GC had his guys start demolishing a wall that was coming down.  In his wisdom he had his guys cut all the cables that were going to the wall coming down.  Unfortunately the new camera cables went over that wall and his guys cut about 7 cables they shouldn't have.

That honestly was the least of the problems that happened at that site.  The network wiring was the stupidest issue and got a business fired.",All the cables!,0
"back story- I was in the army as a IT tech. I had to visit a very remote location to service their computer systems at the hangar. The remote location could only reached by air. I flew out on a C-23 Sherpa transport with duffel bag and tool bag in hand. It was a 3 day job with a return flight on the Sherpa. I had spent 2 18 hour days working on the Aviation unit's  computers. This happened as I was getting ready to leave.

I came back from another part of the installation and was greeted by 30 brand new freshly baked second lieutenants (AKA butter bars) . I had my duffel and tool bag with me. I was a SGT at the time. All 30 pairs of eyes turned to me. One of the group of butter bars asked where I was going. ""catching a ride out of here this afternoon"". All of those green LT's started laughing. ""uh, what's so funny...?"". The LT that had asked said ""we're lieutenants, you're just a sergeant, do you really think you're getting on that plane?"". I replied ""yep. I KNOW I'll be on that plane."" The gaggle of LT's laughed again.  I went to the bathroom and took my time. I came out, all the LT's has sprinted out to the plane to ensure they would get a seat. I walked out of the hanger and across the ramp to the plane, got up to the stairs.. The crew chief yells out ""Sorry Sarge, we're full!"". The LT's laughed again in unison. Suddenly... Someone comes running from the hangar and up to the plane. ""This SGT came out here to work on our computers and network. He has a seat on this plane"". The crew chief looks at the closest LT and tells him to get off his plane. The LT is in shock and horror to having to stay behind. ""What do you mean?! I'm an officer and he's just an NCO!"". Crew chief-  ""Yep, and he came out here to work on Aviation computer equipment. His seat is guaranteed, you flew stand-by and your seat is not. Now get off my plane"".  The LT got off, I got on.

"Back in the late '80s, in the pre-Windows days of MS-DOS, I worked PC support at a smaller university.  When the office workers called with problems, they were usually just normal, every day hardware or software issues.  The faculty, on the other hand, could be much more creative.  Two examples:

1) A professor called and said his system wouldn't boot.  We went over to his office, and sure enough, it wouldn't boot from the hard drive.  We booted it from a floppy and checked out the c:\DOS directory.  Instead of the usual list of files, however, we found that the files had been renamed ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", etc.  I asked the professor what happened, and he said ""Well, I knew those files weren't mine, so I renamed them so it was less messy.""  He didn't want us to reinstall anything, so we spent the rest of the afternoon figuring out which file was which based on size.

2) A faculty member called and said his hard drive was full, and he couldn't free up any space.   When I looked at the root directory, in addition to the usual contents I saw a directory named ""BACKUP"".  I asked him what that was, and he said ""Oh, I copy everything there daily so I don't lose any work.""    I looked in BACKUP, and sure enough, it contained a copy of everything under the root directory... including BACKUP.  I looked in \BACKUP\BACKUP, and again, it contained everything in the root directory, including BACKUP.  You can probably see the pattern forming here, so I'll just jump to the end; somewhere around 15 or 20 recursive levels deep, DOS just gave up and decided not to touch those files any more.  I had to reformat the hard drive to get it cleaned up.",Faculty members vs. MS-DOS,0

"I was one of the lead techs on a military post. Most of our users were in one building, in several units; compartmentalized in offices.  We would send ""the boys"" (junior enlisted) out to do the day-to-day tickets, whereas I was a ""janitor"", who would go into an office and blanket fix everything in that office and move to the next. I was in the middle of a clean up job when I get a ticket for another unit demanding high-pri assistance. I call the user that put the ticket in and ask that he hold on for 2 more days while I finish up the job I'm working on now. He'd furious!

"Hi everyone!

Context: My friend, lets call him Bill, and I work as tech support representatives in the CCTV industry. Before working with our current company that deals mainly with technicians, we both worked at a different company that was oriented towards end users. Finally, one of the most common issues and calls were about connecting the recorder to a phone. While exchanging stories, Bill told me about this gem:  


A woman called in asking for help connecting her system to her phone, and Bill was happy to help: He asked her to check that the cables from the system were connected properly and he asked her to follow the Ethernet cable back to her router. According to the customer it was all connected.

An hour of troubleshooting every possible option later, the issue remained, and Bill was just about ready to request a warranty replacement, when he had an idea: He asked the woman to describe each cable and tell him where exactly they were connected. By the end of the descriptions Bill had figured it out! Turns out that the woman had the Ethernet cable connected to her smart TV, and she thought that the TV gave internet to the system using the HDMI cable. They connected the recorder to the router and everything worked fine.

Moral of the story: Even when you think you're being specific with your probing questions, the customer will probably find a way to prove you wrong.",What do you mean an HDMI doesn't give internet?,0
"As previously mentioned, fruit-based company as a L2 advisor (although we use T1 and T2). This is another long one.

This was over a year ago, about an hour before the end of the work day. I had had a shitty day, full of crap escalations and stupid consults and in comes another one.

One thing about our system is that we can see the name, vendor and location of the consulting advisor and others on the case. In this case, this guy was from my site, although we were a floor apart. 

Now, we generally are confident that our T1's will cover all the bases before escalating, we help with mentoring and supporting them throughout the day, but this was not the case.

The issue was what is best known as an iCloud lock on an iPad. This locks a phone/iPad to a specific account, although there is a hint that says the first letter of the email address as well as the domain. About 50% of those cases are resolvable on first contact, others require the customer to send in documentation to unlock the device.

The first thing we do in these cases is ask for the serial number of the device. This helps in understanding if what the customer is saying is accurate and if the unit is not marked lost (a deal breaker in these cases). In this case, the escalation was made without a serial number.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Me: Me. T1: The hapless first-line advisor

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*\*upon seeing the case notes and logging\**

Me: Right, where's the serial number? You need to ask for it.

T1: The customer couldn't give it to me, but he's absolutely sure it's \*this account\*. (\*this account\* does contain an iPad)

Me: You know that what they say can't be taken as gospel. Also, it's an iPad, can't they see it on the back of the unit?

T1: Oh yeah, but he's really sure of the account, that's why I didn't push for the serial.

*(Upon hearing this, I smack my desk and mumble a ""For fuck's sake"".)*

Me: Fine. If you're that confident, give me the call. But if it's the wrong account, you're getting a negative peer feedback for not logging per procedure.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I take the call, gather the serial and, guess what, the account linked to the iPad was different. Our system shows what names the users name their devices and the names didn't match.

10 minutes later and with the magic of research and identity verification, the device was unlocked. (the customer knew the password, just not the email)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A few minutes later, I was finishing my last call when I notice a dude sit next to me. I had seen his face but never spoken to him. When I finish, I ask him what's up, to which he says:

T1: ""Hey, I was the one you spoke to a while ago. I wanted to apologize for not gathering the serial but I also heard what you said and I will put that in a negative feedback.""

I should point out that T1 and T2 were in different floors precisely to avoid confrontations regarding escalations (not like this anymore).

I took it lightly and told him it was a long day and it sucked to get a poor escalation from someone from the same site.

However, I went to my supervisor and asked to listen to the consultation. Sure enough, my muttering was audible on the call. She then asked what the guy wanted. I told him what it was, to which she acts surprised.

""He told me he just wanted to talk to you about something unrelated, I thought you knew eachother! He said he got permission from his supervisor downstairs, but he shouldn't. I need to see what happened.""

I shrugged my shoulders and left. On the elevator down, I stumble upon the T1 supervisor, who happened to be on my team when he got promoted.

""So, did you listen to that consult?"" - I ask him.

""What consult?"" 

When I explained to him what happened, he simply goes: 

""That god damn moron, he didn't ask for any permission, I would never let him go up! He told that to your supervisor? FFS, we're gonna need to talk to him.""

The following day I heard he got his ass handed to him by his management and got a disciplinary warning by HR while I got a negative feedback, which has 0 negative impact.

"Recent discovery that we are still in the process of figuring out what to do with.

background. was working out a ticket to set up a PC for a new hire in a remote office.

M = Me

U = User

First off, when I reached out to the user they were logged into another user's profile, which is already a no-no. In their defense, they hadn't gotten their credentials yet and their manager probably told them it was okay.

*not* in their defense, I sent the manager the new user's credentials days prior; but that's not the subject of this post.

&gt;M = Okay, we need to get you set up on your own profile. is there anything you had saved on this desktop you'd like me to transfer over?

&gt;U = yeah, just these few spreadsheets on the bottom.

&gt;M = Okay, are these your files or &lt;profile owner's&gt; files? do you share them?

&gt;U = honestly, they're just templates that I grabbed off the J:/ drive. we can get them back from there.

now, I do know that the only drives IT manages or are aware of are a P:/ drive for department shares and a few folks have legacy personal H:/ drives (we're migrating to OneDrive/Teams/Sharepoint for personal network storage).

&gt;M = Wait, what's the J:/ Drive? Can you show me?

&gt;U = sure, let me open it up.

Proceed to find that the path doesn't point to a network path as I expected (\\AMXXXVF01) ""North America, Location code, Virtual Fileserver 01"". Instead, the path pointed to \\&lt;COMPUTERNAME&gt;\J:\PUBLIC_DRIVE

At this point, I'm more perplexed than anything.

&gt;M = so, your whole team uses this? 

&gt;U = yeah, the whole department as far as I'm told. I just started so I don't know the details.

I then proceed to gather more information from the user's supervisor and department head. Turns out, this is a 4TB External HDD connetced via USB to an old Windows 7 desktop that is due to be replaced. 

And an entire department has this drive mapped to their PC as a J:/ drive. They're all using if for ""backup"" storage and have ~60GB used so far.

I brought this to my IT Director, who then reached out to the Branch Manager to let them know this is completely not okay as it's a huge security risk. Anyone could just walk in, grab the drive and walk out.

We're now heavily pushing them to work with us in migrating the data to OneDrive.

There's no local IT presence at any other offices, so all work is done remotely. No local IT presence also means that these offices inevitably often turn into the wild west as the managers start treating it like their own little company.

&gt;$IT:   Hi, this is $IT from IT, how may I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;$LUSER: THE FUCKING MONITOR IS NOT WORKING! WHAT DID YOU DO TO IT? FIX IT! NOW!  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: Calm down, buddy. Watch your language! And there's no reason to shout. Is the blue light on the monitor on?  
&gt;  
&gt;$LUSER: YES OF COURSE IT'S ON! DO YOU THINK I'M THAT STUPID?
&gt;
&gt;$IT internally: yes
&gt;
&gt;$IT: OK, is the screen blank or does it say anything?  
&gt;  
&gt;$USER: It says ""No signal"". WHY DID YOU BREAK IT?  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: We didn't touch it. Is the cable properly plugged into the laptop?  
&gt;  
&gt;$USER: YES IT FUCKING IS, YOU IDIOT!  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: Calm down. One more swear or insult and I'll disconnect the call. And just so you know all calls to the help desk are recorded. Understood? ***long pause*** Now, could you check if that cable is plugged in to the monitor?  
&gt;  
&gt;$USER: OK. ***A couple of seconds later*** Ugh, Agrh, Ugh, *straining noises*  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: What are you doing?  
&gt;  
&gt;$USER: Pulling...on...the...CABLE!  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: No, stop it!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Couple of seconds later:** BANG, Aaaaah, Bang, Bang.  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: Hello, are you there, what happened!?  
&gt;  
&gt;A couple of seconds later $BOSS picks up the phone.  
&gt;  
&gt;$BOSS: Hello? Who is this?  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: Hi $BOSS, this is $IT. What happened? Is $USER all right?  
&gt;  
&gt;$BOSS: He's knocked out on the floor! I'm calling an ambulace. *click*

$BOSS told $IT what happened during lunch. Apparently he was on the floor putting his full weight on the screwed in VGA cable (because always screw in VGA), which lead to the ""monitor stand"" 2-by-4 coming loose and smacking him in the head, knocking him out and giving him a laceration that had to be treated at the hospital.

$USER also got a good scolding the next day from $BOSS, after he listened to the call.

$USER hasn't called the help desk since this incident, but has written an apology to $IT.

Maybe we should actually bring back the clue-by-fours.

**TL/DR**: User pulls too hard on VGA cable while under desk, monitor and stand hit him in the head.

*Update*:

Since some of you were asking, I asked $IT:

- $USER built the monitor stand himself

- The monitor surprisingly still works, because it hit $USER with it's back. Just the back housing is broken and the metal VGA port bent, with it's threading destroyed.",User self-administers clue-by-four,0
"So this just happened a couple of minutes ago. User calls me asking for help because their PC is really slow and programs aren't working right. 9/10 times it is just a single program error which I can run a bat to kill it.

Then I feel really hot air on my leg and notice the personal heater is on and guess where it is. You guessed it, right next to the computer. Once I turned it off the computer started to function normally as it cooled down. Told user to stop using heater next to PC and they said ""I didn't know it could do that"". Problem solved.

"Thursday:  
Grab a case that looks like it will be a quick call and done. I don't have a ton of time, so that will be great! Call customer contact. He gets a user who was told of the issue on the line as well. We start a screenshare. User says that some reports are missing from a patient's chart that should have come through an interface. They don't know what reports or where they would have come from. All they have is the patient's name and that ""something"" is missing.

I look and they have a number of document interfaces, so I don't know which this mystery document should have come through. If we ever got it. And I can't find any errors on any interface lately anyway.

Friday:  
We reconvene with a different user who the contact says he was told knows about the issue. This call is the first time the user is hearing about the issue.

"I do (or coordinate) all the tech where I work.  It's a small part of my overall duties but I'm often called for advice or help with all manner of things.

One employee in particular is a great source of weird and whacky problems.  One time really stands out.  My office is less than 20 feet from hers but the first part was by phone:

Coworker:  hey there, my computer is broken again

Me: hi!  Is this Coworker?

Coworker:  yes, I don't know why but it's not working, I keep getting kicked out.

Me:  oh ok, so it sounds like the computer is turned on and you are seeing stuff on your screen.  What do you mean by being kicked out?

Coworker:  I can't check my email.  It won't let me in.

Me: ok, I'll be right there

At this point, I'm thinking anything but she just printed something to our copier and I'm able to use the internet, so I'm guessing it's probably a password issue.  I get to her office.

Me:  hey, so show me what's wrong.

Coworker:  see?  I try to enter the password and I keep getting kicked out.

Sure enough, her input isn't going into the text box.  What the heck?

Then I notice the problem.  Her desk is completely cluttered and she has a big fat file folder diagonally sitting across the top left tip of her keyboard.

It's pressing the escape key down.  Amazing.

I point it out and we laugh.  I'm just happy it wasn't more serious than that.

"First time post. (on mobile so please forgive format /spelling) 

I work for a company that sells machine parts from 3rd parties as well as custom machined parts. It's spread out over most of the US and Canada. I work in the US based support center (been there about a year at this point, moved up since then). The year 2015. The ticket notes help recreate this retelling. So, to the story.

OP - me
CE - clueless employee
M - my manager

OP - ""Good morning, this is OP. How can I help you?""

CE - ""I can't keep working like this. Why haven't you fixed the printer yet? It's causing major issues here!""

OP - ""Did you call previously about this printer or submitted a ticket?""

CE - ""No. Not my job."" (oh, the foreshadowing) 

OP - ""OK. Let me get some info first. Who am I speaking with? Can you confirm the branch number?  One moment please.
All the network office printers appear to be online and aren't reporting any errors.""

CE - ""I never said there was a problem with the office printers!""

OP - ... ""Could you please elaborate then on the printer you said was causing issues?""

CE - ""The label printer! What did you think I meant?""
(we have industrial label machines for printing bin labels or shipping labels) 

OP - ""Which computer is it connected to?""

CE - ""We boxed it up already but you never sent us a return shipping label!""

OP - :realization on what they were babbling about: ""Is this a label printer for your shipment system?""

CE - ""Yes. Are you even listening?"" *grunt*

OP - ""When did the issue start? Yesterday or this morning?""

CE - ""6 months ago!"" mumbles to someone ""...these idiots are going to put us out of business..."" 

OP - :eyes rolling: ""Excuse me but how have you been printing the shipment labels all this time?""

CE - ""I've been going to 'local po box store'. That reminds me. We need to get these invoices fixed too. It cost way more than what the sales order has listed.""

OP - :😒: ""Why didn't you report this sooner? We could have sent a replacement the next day. This is why we have a contract with the shipper. Those values are based on that contract."" 

CE - ""Look, I don't have time to waste with you. You're supposed to be IT. I wouldn't have to report anything if you were doing your job. Just get this fixed!""
mumbles ""I T must mean idiots"" *group laughter*

OP - ""Hey M, just had someone on phone that thinks we have a crystal ball for all their problems.""

M - :smh: ""Yeah, heard the tail end of that. Besides, our ouija board is broken.""

OP - *chuckle* ""Yep.""

Needless to say we shipped replacement label printer and a few weeks later they finally ship us the broken printer back.

Turns out they put the labels in upside-down jamming it and the thermal ribbon was backwards too. That was a mess to fix.

Also, an apology letter, about her rude comments, was stuffed in the bottom of the box to try and hide it.

This isn't the first time, nor will it be the last for those of us in IT. 

Coworker bought an 8 ball to give advice to those seeking a crystal ball response from us a few days later. Definitely some amusement from that since we'd tried to add the results to our phone conversations.

The worker in question was terminated shorty after. Her boss and HR got a copy of the call audio.
This was her 3rd strike for verbal abuse.

"So, long story short I work in a small-sized company with some older lads who struggle a little with computers which is fine and I've gotten used to giving them a hand but recently I've been trying to make do with our systems and introduced a VPN so they can work remotely (Most of the time they're out of the office). So here's how it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Guy with problem = GWP

OP = me

\*GWP sends email\*

&amp;#x200B;

"" Hi OP, (Ahoy there!)

\*Calls GWP\*

&amp;#x200B;

OP: Hey GWP, hope you're having a nice time in Iceland, any chance you could check the Laptop? I can't get into it.

&amp;#x200B;

GWP: No problem! \*Noises of him sitting down and getting laptop open etc\*

GWP: I still can't get into the office OP!

&amp;#x200B;

OP: I know, that's why I need you to connect through your hotspot so I can see if I can help.

&amp;#x200B;

GWP: Nope, still not work!

&amp;#x200B;

\*Crys a little internally\*

&amp;#x200B;

GWP: Here I'll send you a photo of what it says.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is where the magic happens for me.

He sends me a photo of him attempting to connect through the VPN. Comes up with the obvious, can't connect blah blah blah. But its the one little piece of information below that just makes my day because I know he is trying his best to connect and he is the most gentle giant you'd ever meet.

&amp;#x200B;

His next comment being: ""Shall we try another laptop?""

&amp;#x200B;

I could of laughed, I could of cried. But it made my day. After spending the next 30 minutes explaining to him that I doubt he's going to be able to get in, let alone why he shouldn't whilst he's on annual leave. It made me chuckle and when telling others in the office we all laughed because we know he has the best intentions.

&amp;#x200B;

thought this might be worthy of the tales here.

"I used to install car alarms and remote starters for an automotive shop.

I installed a car alarm in customer's car that comes with a key-less entry key fob. The lock and unlock buttons arm and disarm the alarm as well as control the locks on the doors. No problems, totally routine.

The next day customer returns to the shop complaining that his key fob is no longer working. He hands it to me and sure enough, no response from the car.

These alarm units have a sequence of button presses etc to pair and reprogram the key fobs. I attempt to pair the customer's current fob to the alarm unit, but it fails to recognize it. Hmm strange.

I get a new fob from off the shelf and try the pairing again. Works perfect. Great. See you later. It's under warranty.

Next day customer is back again, same deal. Fob that I paired yesterday no-longer works and won't pair again. Grab a new one, pairs straight away. See you later.

Customer returns for a third time. OK, something is fishy here.

I ask the customer:
&gt;""what do you do for a living?""

He says
&gt;""I'm a welder.""

(internally) Bingo!

I ask him:
&gt;""Do you keep your keys in your pocket while you're at work?""

&gt;""I do"" 
He says. 

I pair a **FOURth** fob for him and tell him:
&gt;""Keep your keys in your locker from now on.""

I have't seen him since.

"This happened many years ago when the internet was newish to consumers and people were still using dial up to access it.

I was working for a PC manufacturer in a call centre as a second level support agent.  I took an escalation call that had been passed on by another L2 agent who was at his wits end.

&gt;Husband: the internet works fine for me but not for my wife.  Every time she goes to use it, it disconnects.

Previous techs had tried all the basics, but no love from the internet for her.  Even if he left it connected the minute she sat down to use the computer it would disconnect.

Eventually, I was reminded of another client who couldn't use the internet between 3pm - 6pm and 5am - 7am.  That was because that's when his neighbors electric fence was turned on and the cheap modems that we were shipping were so sensitive to outside RF interference that the fence was enough to prevent his modem from connecting, we resolved that by shipping a hardware modem instead of the usual soft modem.

So, I started digging into the situation.  Was anything electric running that she was using that her husband wasn't?  I was thinking maybe an electric wheelchair, turns out I was close.  She had a prosthetic arm that had some kind of motor in it to open and close the hand, that was enough to knock out the modem.  Solution was to send a hardware modem, after that the internet stopped hating his wife.",The internet hates my wife.,0
"In the late 80s, early 90s I got re-involved with a charity that was trying to help disabled people, especially those with progressive illnesses, stay in work.

One of the clients had multiple sclerosis. She was a talented architect in her mid 50s and was the senior partner of a practice. Unfortunately the MS had become so bad that she could no longer go to the office to work. She was wheelchair bound and needed a 24 hour carer. But there was nothing wrong with her brain or her vision of how building should be designed.

This was driving her crazy so we arranged a home office for her using the highest specked PC we could think of at the time. It had a Wacom tablet that weighed a lot, an A3 plotter as well as a daisywheel printer and a early model Dragon Dictate card. The computer ran AutoCAD software.

We spent a couple of weeks recording the verbal commands for controlling the software as she spoke them and matching them to the appropriate keystrokes. Think “Undo” matching to CNTRL-Z etc.

Eventually we got it all working and she was a happy bunny. Then I got a call from her carer saying that she had a problem and could I call in. 

Me: Hi Bunny - what’s your problem

Bunny: the computer is magic - It’s doing things to my designs before I tell it to.

I’m somewhat confused as I has never heard of a computer that could predict future action except in Science Fiction.

Bunny: I see you don’t believe me but if you can stick around I’ll show you.

She starts working on an incredibly complex drawing for some restoration project she was working on. Then all of a sudden she has a spasm and the Wacom tablet’s stylus goes flying and the drawing has a huge line added to it. Almost simultaneously she yells ""OH F\*\*K"".

The computer thinks for a second and removes the line.

Bunny: See I was going to tell it to undo the last operation but it has done it already. It’s magic.

Me: Is it a problem? - I can make sure it doesn’t happen again.

Bunny: DON’T YOU DARE. Do you think it will learn to read other thoughts? Could I get it to do more things?

Me: I don’t think so - it could have unintended consequences - best left alone I think. 

However I did get a brand decal made for the computer that said “Magic Computer”.

She was happy and told everyone who came to see her that was worried she couldn’t produce the work that she didn’t have a problem with her work and her MS because she had a magic computer.

I didn’t tell her that I had mapped her ""OH F\*\*K"" sound file to the undo command also.",Tales from the past - The Magic Computer,0
"Here's a short tale on how my school's administration manager declared me a Hero To The People. 

A little bit of background: My school has three distinct networks - a semi-public one (which all teachers and pupils can connect to and which is obviously ranked lowest in the router's list of priorities), a private one for all the school's PCs and a seriously locked down one for the administrative and privileged stuff. The latter one also isn't supervised by our school's own IT staff but by a dedicated company (The Company from hereon) which solely does this kind of work for our state.

They're also a bit weird. You'll see.

That much for the background. On to the story!

So, our administrator (let's call him Felix) has this really powerful laser printer. Coloured prints, duplex, \*really\* fast, stapler, everything you might need to print lots of documents (be that certificates or disciplinary records). Costs a considerable four-figure sum.

He recently had to replace the fuser - that one was easily done: Open the lid, pop out the old one, push new one in, close lid and reset the fuser counter.

It was the last step where he hit a small snag: The menu in which to reset the counter was password protected. The Company in its undecipherable wisdom had decided that because the printer was connected to the administrative network that all its features needed to be locked down. Hence the password. I'm not precisely sure what havoc the maintenance menu could wreak on the network but hey! And yes, maintenance menu. This printer also had a *separate* configuration menu (protected by a different password).

Off to the support hotline he went to answer the riddles three - promptly to be thrown into the abyss.

Felix: ""So you see, I kind of need this password?""  
Support: ""You cannot handle the ~~truth~~ password!""

For some reason this then resulted in a three months standoff after which The Company could finally be persuaded to dispatch a technician.

Come the day of His Arrival:  
Felix: ""Good morning! You can help me with this password issue?""  
Technician: ""You cannot handle the ~~truth~~ password!""  
Felix: ""Yeah, I kind of figured that out by now. That's why **you** are here, after all, right?""  
Technician: ""I ~~can't handle the truth~~ am not allowed to know the password either!""  
Felix: *\*twitch\**

Yeah, the rest of the meeting went equally well. The proposed solution was thus: Buy a new printer (remember the four-figure cost? That would come out of *our* budget!) and **scrap** the old one (because it had been contaminated by secrets!)

Needless to say, Felix didn't think much of that ""solution"" and that's when he approached me. The rest of the story is somewhat anticlimactic:

I had a look at the printer and it definitely had a bit more computing power in there than your usual $30 printer from Walmart. In a flash of inspiration I also remembered that most devices have some hardware capability of resetting stuff to factory settings. A quick Google search yielded a video on YouTube how to do just that for this exact model of printer (you can find tutorial videos for the most insanely off-track devices on there. Now, if those guys could just reduce their waffling from ten minutes down to the actual 30 seconds of relevant stuff...). One minute with a screw driver and a change of position for a jumper and presto!

No more password. And yes, the default configuration works just fine, too.

It was then that I received my title of Hero To The People.

Me: Ma'am you have the unit connected to the router with an Ethernet cable? 

End user: What you mean to ""connect a cable to the router"", the internet white box? 

Me: Yes, ma'am the system should be connected to the router in order to have the remote access.

Me: Ma'am your NVR doesn't support wifi it must be connected to the router to grab an IP address from the router.

Still I make her restart the router and check and the wifi still doesn't work. So I tell her to check with her service provider as it is out of support for us, she was pissed as shit when I told that, she wanted me to contact her service provider and check as I am IT and should deal with it.
Tried explaing her that this is corporate tech support and we do not deal with personal device issue and will have to speak to her service provider herself.

"A most recent tale of the most inept person I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with.

This fine example of divergent evolution had to configure a VPN token on her phone to remotely access our network.

The process is fairly simple for anyone capable of tying their shoes or using a spoon. You download something on your phone, enter your credentials on our webpage and scan the QR code on screen with your phone when it shows up. Then you enter the resulting code under the QR code.

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to explain this process as simply as I could, but the user got stuck on finding the QR code. I asked her if she could see ""A black and white square with 3 black corners"" on their screen, which, of course, she could not. 

Being unable to describe to me what she was seeing with her own eyes, I managed to get her to send me a screen capture. I was sent a dropbox link with a terribly pixilated JPG. In this image, I saw that she had scrolled all the way down the page and, thus, could no longer see the QR code, because she had not yet attained object permanence. After much effort, I'd managed to get her to look directly at the QR code. She described it as: ""A black and white square with 3 black corners"", and assured me with great confidence that this was not, in fact, a QR code. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now came the step of scanning the code. I asked her to press ""configure by scanning"" on her phone and to scan the code. She spent 3 minutes scanning the lint and partially eaten crayons on her desk, then asked me when the process would be over. I had to told her to lift her arm and scan the code on the screen.

&amp;nbsp;

Once the code had been scanned, her phone started giving her a 6 digit code to plug into the webpage. That code changes every 30 seconds. This arduous process took her more than 30 seconds. By some miracle, she managed to gain access after a few tries.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, she could download the thing she came for on our page. I got her to click on the bigass ""DOWNLOAD HERE"" button, but she told me that nothing was happening. I told her to describe what she was seeing to me: ""2019 October, a black cat"". She had opened her download folder and started clicking on random things instead of the thing she had just downloaded. 

She told me that the process was taking too long and that now she was tired and hung up.

"This JUST happened and now I'm taking a break, so here I am...

:Admin

:ME

One of the things that I do at work is build Cisco phones for new hires, replacements for failed devices (fracking data ports!), SNR, EM... all of that.

We have large number of offices and *most* have a Deskside team who would provide the appropriate MAC address of the phone to build. For the offices who do NOT have support, we contact the manager - how THAT often goes could be a whole other post.

A ticket comes in for a new hire who will be located in an office that does not have a support team onsite. I contact the manager who passes it off to his administrative assistant, who he says is new to the position, but ""pretty good with computers."" Not yet having lost ALL hope, I say great and give her a call...

Me: Hey Admin, I have a ticket for NEW-HIRE reporting to MANAGER and MANAGER told me to contact you to get the MAC address of a phone to build for her.

...and this is where I learn that she is either having a REALLY super bad day and/or is just a total and complete, uh.... not-nice-person. This horrible attitude of hers, right or wrong, prompted my final comments to her.

Admin: Well, that's just great, isn't it? I have no idea what the heck a MAC address is and now I'm supposed to go running around the building in search of something that I've never heard of?

...I have her go to the desk location in the ticket and on the Cisco phones that we use, it's a simple GEAR button, #4 to get the MAC. She does that without trouble and reads it off to me.

Admin: I don't know how I got stuck doing this, I'm not the phone guy. Are you going to actually DO anything with the number that I just gave you or was all of this just busy work for me?

ME: I'll log into the Cisco systems and build the profile for NEW-HIRE so that on her start date, she'll come in to find a working phone with her name &amp; extension on the desk.

Admin: Yeah, well, there is already some personal stuff on this desk and a crapload of dust.

Me: She doesn't start until 8/12, that must have been left behind by the previous person. Usually that would have been cleared away, any maybe still will be, but without a local team there I'm not sure how that will handled.

Admin: NEW-HIRE will be given a phone used by someone else?

Me: Well... yes.

Admin: That's so gross. Someone has had their hands all over it and has held the handset up to their ears. There will be germs, oils and all kinds of stuff all over that phone. That's just plain bad practice.

Me: It's not feasible to provide a new phone to every person who needs a phone. The cost and overhead of providing a brand new phone to everybody would destroy the budget. Some of the offices have Clorox wipes that people can use for all kinds of things, including wiping down the phone, I guess.

Admin: No, that's gross and just shouldn't be done. I would NEVER use someone else's phone.

Me: I have some bad news regarding that...

"Context: My work has a custom word menu. the menu is split into two parts, the first being standard templates, the second being printing macros. You accessed it by going to a ribbon in word called 'add-ins' and there were two separate menus.

&amp;#x200B;

This menu was originally created and only amendable using word 2000. It is an important part of our environment, both for every day usage and for compliance purposes. It has to be on everyones PC.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been wanting to replace it for years with something that doesnt require Word 2000 to edit it. I built a new menu using word 2010 about 18 months ago, and ran it alongside the old menu. The idea was to get people used to the new menu, as while it had the same options, the layout was different. each section had it's own ribbon, which was clearly marked. I sent out an email with screenshots and red boxes indicating where users could find things. i made it clear that if they didn't have the new menu or couldn't find anything, to get in contact.

&amp;#x200B;

I hadn't retired the old menu yet as I had not found a way to push the menu onto a rdp environment until recently. When i got it working, and tested it successfully over a period of time, I sent another email out, going over the new menu, where everything was, and announcing that the old menu would be retired on the 1st August.

&amp;#x200B;

So onto the story. i remove the old menu, and await the calls. odd. nothing. so i forget. until late afternoon, when i have two calls back to back that made me facedesk.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hello, IT

&amp;#x200B;

Caller 1: Hi IT, with the old menu gone i cannot print anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: just one second, i'll log on. (it could be that it wasn't there).

Caller 1: i saw your email and wasn't sure that i had the new menu. you know how i am with I.T and technology. i don't need anything else other than printing.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: \[as soon as I logon i see that she does have the menu. the last most tab is titled 'printing'\]. \[Caller 1\], you use the printing tab.

&amp;#x200B;

Caller 1: where? I always used to use the add-ins tab, which was right at the end, to print

&amp;#x200B;

Me: well that menu has been retired. you use the printing tab

Caller 1: where is that? i can't see it

Me:\[this is not an I.T issue, this is a use your goddamn eyes issue\]. no problem!

Caller 2: OH. i didn't see them. sorry.

"Hi. I've posted here before, but I figured I'd give some background info again; Our company sells security materials, which includes CCTV material and everything related (servers for VMS systems, tech support for the IP-camera's etc). We're pretty much a distributor and we only sell to installers who install products for end-users. 95% of our clients have a basic understanding of IT and as such have no issue installing the security materials and only call when there's a product-specific issue. In fact, in this line of business, it's kind of required to have at least some basic knowledge of IT.  

In this case our customer calls us and tells me he has an issue with one of his customers (B2B and all that). His PC was doing strange things with the VMS program that was supposed to run on it and I had a hard time figuring out whether it was the actual VMS or the PC that was giving the issue. We e-mail back and forth trying a few things until his customer snaps at my customer and tells him he wants it fixed ASAP or he won't pay his bills. My customer asks if I can't call his customer. 

""Sure,"" I said. Normally we don't do this being B2B, but I decided to help my customer out on this. 

I call his customer. Let's call him **OhHiMark**. I'm **me** (duh).

&gt;**Me:** ""Hello, am I speaking with OhHiMark?   
&gt;  
&gt;**OhHiMark:** ""Yes. You're calling about the computer right? Can you fix it already?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ""I can certainly try. Can I get a teamviewer access to your computer?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**OhHiMark:** ""No.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ""No?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**OhHiMark:** ""Yes, I have teamviewer reserved for other purposes for my business and I don't need you guys breaking it. If teamviewer stops working I lose a day worth of business.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ""Oh. Okay. Well then I can't connect I'm afraid.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**OhHiMark:** ""Yes you can, use Anydesk!""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ""...Sure. I'll download it. Give me a minute.""

So I download Anydesk and he gives me his ID. I log on and I check out the PC. 

&gt;**Me:** ""Hmm. Something's definitely wrong. I'd like to confirm a few things with the manufacturer of the VMS to make sure we're on the right track, would that be alright with you sir?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**OhHiMark:** ""Yes, whatever. I'm a very busy man. Do you know how many people I have under me?! Just get it fixed.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ""Alright. ""

I hang up  the phone but stay connected to his PC. I dial the number to our manufacturer and within seconds I'm in a call with them. I explain the issue, we go back and forth a bit and this goes on for about 5 minutes. Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I see him moving his mouse and I see it going to the START-menu. He opens freaking solitaire and starts playing it. During the entire conversation I had with our manufacturer, which was a good 20 minutes, he was playing the game. Even after I hung up he kept playing. The only reason why he stopped playing is because I called him again.

&gt;**Me:** ""Okay so I have some news.""

Suddenly he remembers I'm still connected to his computer and he quickly turns off solitaire.

&gt;**OhHaiMark:** ""Y-yes. *Cough.* What uhm, what's the issue?""

We eventually fixed the issue and I didn't bring up the solitaire thing. He seemed relieved that I didn't.","I'm a very busy man, I don't have much time!",0
"I work 2nd line for an MSP supporting a hundred or so companies. Even though we have more than 1,000 client employees reporting to us, there are always some we deal with more than others. This is doubly likely to be the case if they're in-house IT, allowing them to deal with the 1st line issues before it is passed to us. Invariably, this means the tickets those clients pass to us are 10x more complicated...

* IT - In-house IT engineer, damn good filter.

* NE - Network engineer

* Me - ...me

The client in question is very much an email based company. About 3 weeks ago, their external IP address was blacklisted due to a machine sending out hundreds of SMTP requests, meaning they were then unable to send any emails out using their software. Thankfully, my colleague investigated it at this time, and through speaking to both NE and blacklisting company was able to ascertain which machine it was, so was able to run complete virus scans on the machine, cleaning it completely, by which point all SMTP traffic had ceased. This allowed the IP address to be unblocked, and the issue was finished. (Or so he thought...)

This morning, I receive a call from IT saying that the software isn't sending emails. We share a mutual grumble about how unhelpful their software support is (story for another day), and agree that I can reboot the servers in half an hour, giving work time to be save, etc. I schedule the reboot, and ask for a call back if the issues continue. In a shock to literally nobody on here, the issue did continue. In this call, however, I was notified that they not only there was an error, but that this had happened recently when IT was off on holiday, so he was unfamiliar with the resolution. It was at this stage that I learn about the aforementioned ticket, so was able to read into it and see that the exact issue had occurred again.

Armed with this knowledge, I immediately called NE to see what information they could provide about the machine in question, as they manage the network. Unfortunately, the only information they could provide at the time was IP address and MAC address, and that it was on the guest network, though on request they were able to block port 25 for the guest network. I contact IT again, and ask him to pop a laptop onto the guest wi-fi so that I could find more information about the machine, and potentially even the user in question, as no machine matching those details was showing in our software. He then joined me to the guest network but I was unable to find anyone else on it at the time (later found out this was due to disallowing client-client communication on that network), so I took that to mean the machine in question had stopped using the network. Went back to the provider a final time before contacting the blacklist company, only to find out the machine was still on the network. Nonplussed, I did some more scans but was still unable to locate the machine, so I called NE again to see if he could tell me anything else about the machine, this time he was able to tell me that it was being used to stream the cricket. 

From this, I was able to ask IT to do a floorwalk and see if he could find who would be streaming it, though warned him that whomever was doing so wouldn't be able to just exit the stream, we **NEEDED** to get onto their machine to scan it. He back only a few minutes later to say that one user had brought in a personal laptop so that they could stream the cricket in the break room. This made me realise something, and check the dates of the previous outage. The thing in common between the two days? England vs Australia. Clearly a user of good taste, if poor security sense.

IT offered to phone the user (as they had now left the office), and was able to get them to hotspot using their phone, and confirm it was that machine causing the issue. When then asked for my advice for what to do with the laptop, I suggested that if he brought it within a mile of the office again, it could be removed via the window. (Preferably, with the user to follow) 

The only things I'll say in the user's defence is that at least they used the Guest wi-fi, and I've been informed they sounded absolutely horrified when they discovered it was their fault for the 12+ company hours wasted. I have also offered to personally visit the office if he brings it in again, though that could cause more problems...",That's just not cricket.,0
"I was working for a TV distributor with both cable and dish channels. They had their own brand of TV box/decoders.

When the customer in question called in and started by saying that I had to believe him, I knew it was going to be a great call. The log showed he had called several times before.

Customer: When my wife is at home, the remote control to the decoder doesn't work.

Me: Yes, it does, but I'll hear you out.

Inner Me: I bet she takes the batteries.

Customer: Your colleagues all guessed that she takes the batteries..

Inner Me: Darn it.

Customer: ..but she doesn't! I can be holding the remote control and it works fine. She comes home and ten minutes later it doesn't work any more. I haven't let go of the control, and even tried changing batteries when it stopped working just to be sure, but it doesn't make a difference.

We go back and forth for a long time, thinking of different things that could be an issue. He's being nice about my inability to help him, and though I started out thinking he's just another customer who thinks that the reply to ""Did you check if the cable is connected properly?"" is always ""Yes, I did, I even tried five different cables."", even though they didn't, I quickly realise he's tech-savvy and we test and discard a dozen theories.

In the end, 45 minutes later, we solved it. 

When his wife got home, she pulled the curtains apart to let in light, and the sunlight was directly on the IR reciever, interfering with the remote control. When his wife left, he pulled the curtains to see the TV better. They'd tried to lower production cost of the new line of decoders, so the dark plastic in front of the IR reciever was just that - dark plastic instead of a filter to block other light.

Me: I understand, can you just try to call him again, and please repeat the numbers you dial so i can confirm that it is correct. 

Old man: HNNNN m most c c ch call brother!! 

Now he seems very stressed. 

Me: Is it something urgent? Do you need me to call him? 

Old man now shouting: HHHHHOOOSBITAL.... (i heard something hit the floor). 

Me now freaking out: Hello? hello?! Are you there? 
I was thinking what the F? Did he just fall?! A heart attack?!! 

I maxed out the sound on the headset, the call was still ongoing and i could hear a faint breathing.

Me: Hello?! Can you hear me? Are yiu conscious? 
He did not answer... 

I freaking out, a light panic gripped me and i froze like a deer in the headlights. I could not think straight. 
I called his brother because idk, maybe he knew what just happened. (panic)

Me: Hi again this is OP. I was just in a call with your brother and all of a sudden he became stressed out and yelled hospital and then i think he fainted. He seemed to want to cone in contact with you? Do you know what just happened? 

Old mans brother: Oh dear.. I think he just might have had a stroke again, the doctors had warned about this. I cannot check on him im 10 miles away! 

Me freaking out even more: We must get an ambulance! 

Old mans brother: Ofc we do! But i don't know his exact adress! 

Me: i have all of the information infront of me. I can call them. 

So i called the emergency number and asked for an ambulance to the customers adress, they asked me to hold the line with them and the old man if i heard him stop breathing and keep trying to contact him. 

The police and ambulance came to the customers door and tried to open the door after failed communication attempts. 10 minutes after i called the emergency number the old dudes breath became irregular and weaker, i told them that and the freaking firemen came and broke down hus door with heavy duty equipment!! 

I heard how they found him and tried to talk to him, and how they moved him around. 
I heard them saying that they have to take him to the emergency room at the hospital and brought a stretcher to lay him down on and carry him to the ambulance. 

I just sat there on my butt like :O the whole time untill the woman from the emergency number told me that we could hang up. 

After that i called the brother and told him what had happened. He was very upset and i heard his voice crack a little bit. He told me to call him tomorrow and we hung up. 

I had no freaking idea what to do. Am i in trouble? i thought. I told like EVERYONE at the office what happened and all of them encouraged me to contact the brother the day after. Which i then did. 

I was nervous and kinda scared when i called. I didn't know how to act because i was not in a situation i had traning for or had ever experienced. 

The brother picked up and immediately shined up in the voice when i introduced me. 

He said that he could not thank me enough for what i did. And that i probably saved his brothers life. 
He actually had a stroke!! He went unconscious and hit his head on the livingroom table in the fall. Luckily it caused minor damage, and his brother had woken up and was alive.
He told me that he would personally call my boss to have a talk with her and tell her to give me a raise, lol. 
I was completely humbled during the entire length of the call, i could barely utter words.

I didn't get the raise but... i got my face printed out and put up in the cafeteria with the text ""Super supporten som räddar liv"" Which means the ""The super supporter that saves lives"". And i fine with that... I barely wanted to think about if he didn't survive, or if i passed him off like a wierdo and hung up! Just to let him lay there and die... 


Nothing like this has ever happened to anyone i know, even after 6 years in the tech support. I don't know if i was unlucky or that it was luck. 

Please tell me if you have had a similar experience some time :)

"A trouble ticket got escalated to me after first level desktop support had already gone to the user's location and looked into the issue.

"I think that this tale needs re-telling due to the timeliness of this news story, and apologies for not having any I.T. angle.
https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ckoyy3/town_evacuated_as_dam_wall_collapses/

Disclaimer: It was a former colleague at a previous employer that is the hero of this tale. And the details were pieced together from office conversations and trade press.

Approximately a decade ago there was a similar earth dam that was at imminent risk of overflowing / collapsing due to excessive rainfall, threatening to wipe out an entire town downstream.

$hero was driving to a different dam to perform a routine examination a few hours away (a normal day for him), when he received a panicked phonecall from the onsite dam manager saying that due to the rain the water levels were too high and the spillway was taking the excess water away, but the flow of excess water was such that it was eroding away the spillway.

For those that are not familiar, spillways look like giant versions of children’s playground slides and they are built (usually of concrete) into dams slightly lower than the level of the tops of the dams, and act exactly the same a your sink overflow mechanisms at home, just a million times larger. And can cope with a certain flow of water, but if that flow is exceeded then the spillway will erode away, and will continue to erode away through the body of the dam.

$hero on hearing the news turned his car around rapidly, (I don’t know if the car tyres actually squeeled, but imagine that they did for dramatic effect), and started heading for the failing dam as fast as the wet road would allow (rain flooding the dam remember).

$hero kept pulling over the the side of the road on his journey to $failing-dam to make and receive phonecalls. The calls were to 
1/ reschedule the routine exam, 
2/ assess the condition of the failing dam, 
3/ start the de-watering of the dam to reduce the pressures and minimise the chances of complete failure, and 
4/ marshal the first responders to evacuate the town below (including the setting up of a temporary evacuee centre / commandeer a community hall).

On the way to the failing dam, $hero heard on the local radio news with the local police chief giving an interview, where the reported actually used the pun “the best dam engineer/ best damn engineer”.

By the time $hero reached the police cordon around the control room / crisis command centre, the locally available pumps were already working and more lorries with additional pumps were on their way, the evacuation of the town was in progress, and barriers to control large quantities of spilt water if the dam were to catastrophically fail were being erected.

When $hero reached the police cordon he was stopped and was denied entry by the officer manning the gate, so $hero calmly phoned the most senior police commander in his phone’s address book (who he had been speaking to a few minutes earlier) and handed his phone to the officer on the gate. It was later said that the profanities from the police commander could be heard from 20 meters from the handset.

The officer on the gate let $hero through as quickly as he could and $hero ran into the control centre, where he was greeted with a standing ovation from the assembled first responders, local government types and dam owners, as he had (without fully realising it) instructed / explained all the necessary steps to deliver, setup and anchor the pumps.

Then as an anticlimax the dam was dewatered, and so saved then over the next few months was repaired and put back into operation.",The Best Dam engineer,0

" First time poster, long time lurker. I do not work in IT but I wanted to share a story of one of my IT problems as a token of my appreciation for all you fine folks do. I don't claim to be tech savvy or knowledgeable about this field in any way so if any of you think me stupid, I agree. Also I$P was literally my only option for internet if anyone is wondering. 

My story starts in late 2011. I had just moved to Houston after taking a new job and was anxious to get my apartment ready. Shortly after getting my Internet installed I started having trouble connecting any of my devices to the wifi so I called I$P support. What followed was three solid weeks of calls to resolve the problem and after a couple hours on the phone, being told that there is clearly not a problem on their end.

I had techs from I$P come out twice only to tell me there wasn't a problem, though when one of them couldn't connect his own device to the wifi, he said, ""Huh, that should be working"", and left shortly thereafter. All together I, conservatively, spent about 20-30 hours trying to fix this problem over the course of 3-4 weeks.

Then, after reaching my breaking point I took two days off work just so I could have an unlimited amount of time to spend on the phone with support trying to fix this. I called I$P with the number I had by then memorized, and told the tech support person that answered that my problem was beyond their capabilities and I needed to be passed on to next level. You can imagine how that went over. After going through the same troubleshooting issues I had done dozens of times, she said, ""I'm sorry I'm unable to help you, let me pass you on to someone who might have a better idea of the problem.""

No shit.

Next comes our level two guy, we'll call him Sparticus. Sparticus actually does a few new things with me that the other dozen or so level two guys haven't. We go into the back end, change a whole bunch of stuff that I don't recognize, and my wireless begins to trickle to life. It is by no means working, but my devices recognize that there is in fact a router somewhere. Sparticus and I work till about 11am and then, exasperated and defeated, he says, ""Look Muckman, I've tried everything I know and I'm really frustrated, so I'm passing you on to a specialist.""

I knew I was in good hands when, instead of a ""This is Blahblah at I$P tech support, etc"", I hear, ""This is Jeff."" I quickly go over what's been happening over the last month and he joins me in my nearly irate state. He says that he's going to stay with me until we get this resolved. I like Jeff. We start going through things I don't comprehend and giving him access to my computer and such. Jeff starts to get frustrated. About an hour into the call he starts asking me really random questions. ""You're googling this aren't you"", I ask. He replies, ""This is mostly what we do to fix things that don't make any damn sense"". I like Jeff.

Around hour 2 or 3 we've reached a level where we're both comfortable with him working in total silence, occasionally telling me to change or try something. We even took a short break and ate lunch together. Suddenly, around hour 4, he asks, ""Do... do you by chance have the brand new wireless gaming headset from Brand X?"" I do in fact have this wireless gaming headset, this is something I have mentioned to a several people over the course of the month but never raised any flags. ""Unplug it. Don't turn it off, don't disconnect it, remove power chord from the wall.""

I'll be damned if my internet didn't surge to life right then. At this point I'm feeling a strange mix of relief and frustration at both myself and everyone I had talked to for not having solved this seemingly simply problem earlier. He mentioned that he's heard of interference coming from them but never directly cancelling out the signal. He seems excited to log this into the system as as possible problem since apparently no one has ever encountered this before. We say our goodbyes and he comps me 6 months of internet for my troubles.

"It was my day off, and I was busy wrestling the engine out of my riding mower when my phone rang. 

&gt;Me: Hello? 

&gt;Caller: Hi, I’m calling to rent a breast pump

&gt;Me: Uhh, I think you have the wrong number

&gt;Caller: Sorry *click*

WTF I thought, that’s a pretty strange wrong number. I didn’t think anything of it and carried on disassembling the mower. 

A few minutes later, my hands are nice and greasy again when the phone rings. It’s $Hospital. I wipe my hands and answer it.

&gt;Me: Hello? 

&gt;Caller: Hi, I’m calling to sign up for the breastfeeding classes

&gt;Me: Uhh, I think you have the wrong number

&gt;Caller: Sorry to have bothered you *click*

Two calls in a row? I’m willing to bet it wasn’t a coincidence. I was tempted to message our phone guy and ask him to have a look, but before I got the chance, the phone rang again.

&gt;Me: Hello? 

&gt;Caller: Hi, I’m calling to sign up for the childbirth classes

&gt;Me: Uhh, I think you have the wrong number

&gt;Caller: Oh, sorry *click*

Then, I realized, hey dummy, this has happened before. I caught my phone number on the $PhysicalTherapy phones before, and strangely enough, got overflow calls from the switchboard routed to my cell phone once or twice. No coincidence here, there is a ghost in the machine.

**Message time!**


&gt;Me: Hey @phoneGuy I keep getting phone calls meant for OBGYN. Can you search the PBX for my 
cell phone number?

&gt;PG: Can’t, busy racking the new switches and patching stuff in

Fair enough, we’ve been stupid busy. I was just relieved that none of these calls was my boss calling me in for more overtime. 


A while later, I’m almost ready to start my repaired Franken-mower when $Hospital calls again. 

&gt;Me: Hello? 

&gt;Original Caller: Hi, I’m calling to rent a breast pump

&gt;Me: Uhh, I think you have the wrong number again

&gt;OC: Oh Sorry *click*

So I message again

&gt;Me: @Phoneguy, @contractorX, I keep getting wrong number calls from the hospital. Plz out my phone number from the PBX. Someone has a callfwd on.

&gt;PG: Too busy, my dude

&gt;Cx: *crickets*


I’m a little steamed. PhoneGuy is busy and Cx is MIA. I called Cx but didn’t get an answer.

After another wrong number, I grabbed my phone, went to contacts, tapped **Hospital** and checked ‘Send all calls to voicemail’

Minutes later, I get a call from $ContractorX.

&gt;Cx: Hey Bacon, any idea why people can’t get through to the breastfeeding line?

&gt;Me: Oh, that’s why I’ve been getting those strange calls. I’ve been telling $phoneGuy my phone number is in the PBX somewhere. I forgot that has happened before

&gt;Cx: Oh so he’s already aware? Thanks, I’ll give him a call.


Next thing I know, it was fixed, and it never happened again. Was definitely worth a laugh on my day off.	


PS: Many months later, we were searching the PBX and discovered something. Turns out that $PG was using a helpdesk phone as a template, so all of the new phones had my cell number as the default call forward. You better believe I yeeted that out of the PBX with the force of a thousand suns.","I'd like to sign up for the childbirth classes, please",0
"This is another story from my time with the cable company in California.

Occasionally, the company would perform audits of apartment complexes.  The tech assigned the audit would go building-to-building, verifying that people were connected to the services they were paying for (or disconnected if they weren't paying).  Every tech at the company performed audits from time-to-time.  As a backup tech, sometimes I would be sent to remote areas that received few work orders (trailer parks, condos).

Often, we would find someone hadn't been disconnected on their disconnect work order (lazy tech didn't do it, or disconnected the wrong person who got reconnected on a later work order, that sort of thing. Then, there were the thieves.  Bobbie (Roberta) had found such a thief.

Catching cable thieves is hard to do.  You must catch them in the act or they will get away with it.  At the time, we would just disconnect them and move on.  Beyond a sticker on the (locked) service box explaining that it was a crime, it wasn't worth any further effort.  This story is about a time when extra effort was made.

She came into dispatch fuming about someone she had disconnected in an audit a month ago, and today when she was in that same service closet - the guy was connected again.  I looked up the unit and confirmed, no service. Bobby had an idea to fix this guy.  The next day, she went back to that complex and cut his cable back to 3 inches of the wall where it emerged.  Not enough cable to reach the service panel, and just enough cable that we could splice onto it if we needed to.  She was satisfied that he was finally cut off for good.

A few days later, Bobbie fumes into dispatch again ""HE HOOKED HIMSELF BACK UP AGAIN!"".  I said, ""how? you cut his cable"".  The guy had used trash bag twistie ties to build a makeshift cable to the service panel.  He stripped the paper from the ends, tied them together end-to-end making 2 conductors, stripped back his stubby cable and tied himself back in. This guy wasn't taking no for an answer.

She had returned late that night, and it was almost time for me to be off work.  I suggested ""do you want to hang out in the service closet and catch him in the act?"" She wasn't sure if it would work, we didn't even know if the guy was home - but she was game for it.

So we grabbed a 6 pack of beer, went to the apartment complex, ripped out the trash-tie-wiring, and sat down on the floor of the service closet cracking jokes and drinking beers in the dark.

It didn't take long at all.  The closet door swings open and a guy steps inside with a flashlight and a screwdriver prying at the door of the service box.  Bobbie and I turned on our flashlights, spotlighting the guy, and I said ""It's a $10,000 fine for stealing cable"".  The guy nearly jumped out of his skin, he turned to us - caught...hand in the cookie jar.

Bobbie said to him, ""It's $12 a month. Just order service and stop messing up our equipment and we'll forget we saw you doing this."" I can't say for certain, but I think he ran back to his apartment.

I don't recall if he ordered service after that, but we didn't have a problem with him again.",Supporting the techs,0
"What is it with personnel? They take care of themselves and shit on everyone else.

Backstory- after blowing through 700 hours of correspondence courses online, I decided that the education aspect of my 201 file needed to be updated.  I made an appointment to have this done. I show up with my binder of certificates and request that my 201 file be updated to reflect the continuing education I've completed. The personnel SGT looked at it and said "" no way, I'm not adding this in, it's too much work"". Ooook... I walk out without a word, knowing this will be coming back to haunt G1 yet again. 

Fast forward 3 weeks later. I get a work order to fix a desktop down at G1. I walk in, talk with the user and start to come up with a solution to their problem.  As I'm sitting in their cubical, I'm suddenly surrounded by 4 personnel clerks, all saying ""I need my computer worked on"". None of them have work orders, but yet they feel they are entitled to skip the line.  I spun around in the chair, looked at them and pointed to them all and said ""FUCK YOU! I came in a couple weeks ago to get my 201 file updated and you couldn't even do that ! Fill out work orders and I might be back down here in 3 weeks.""  

The clerks realized they messed up. And here comes the bribe.. ""We could update your 201 right now..."" ""Really. Amazing! I just happen to have all of my paperwork to update it with me, right now."" I said.  With speed I've never witnessed from a G1 minion, They had my 201 file out, one clerk reviewing what was being updated, one clerk typing the updates on the record sheet and one clerk inserting the updates into my file. It would truly amazing how fast milpo can can work when given incentive.  They were done with over 150 certificates in 15 minutes flat. They brought the 201 back over me to review and check, it was good. I told them it was good. Faster than a speeding bullet, they closed my 201 file and put it back into the cabinet.

"Hello! So this is my very first story i have ever posted here and if i have done anything wrong in the storytelling please let me know. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working in IT customer service for some years now and I have had my fair share of crazy and stupid people.

&amp;#x200B;

This story is from a couple of years ago in 2014.I was working for my country's biggest ISP as a customer tech supporter, i was mainly helping people with wired internet. Fiber optics and copper cable aswell as home phones and TV.

The company gives a free router to almost all our internet customers that even has a thunder warranty.Before the company had that deal the customers got a simple modem. This will become important later.

&amp;#x200B;

So i was there answering the phone to one lady late at a friday night about 18:30 o'clock.

Me: Hello! My name is OP how can i help you?

Lady: About time! do you know how long i have been in queue? why is the queue so long? don't you have enough staff or are you all just lazy? (She was one of those, i did a mental sighs and mustered my regular nice service voice)

Note: She had this VERY obnoxious tone in her voice and we very rude.

Me: I apologize about the queue time, there has been a major disturbance at a station so alot of people are calling in at the moment. But how may i....(i was interrupted)

Lady: I don't care about your excuses! My internet is incredibly slow and my phone has this annoying scraping sound in it! it has been this way since 3 months ago!! Why havent you done anything about it?!

Me: I understand, i am sorry that you have experienced a slow internet connection for some time but its important to let us know about that sooner so we can help you. Let me just run a few analytics. (The analisys showed a diversion in the cable, a problem that commonly is caused by units connected home at the customer). I proceeded to tell her: The analytics show me a problem that causes your experienced problem, i need to run a few tests to find exactly where this problem is.

Lady: ""She huffs"". Well okay i can wait but make it quick, i don't have all day! and staying in a call like this makes me feel sick! (Me thinking: Wait.. sick?)

Me: How nice of you to help, together we can locate and fix the problem i am sure of it. I need you to pull out all of your units from the internet sockets so i can run the same analisys again to see if i get a different result. But before we do that i need to borrow you mobile phone number so i we can proceed the call from there.

Reluctantly and ranting under her breath she gave me her number and we proceeded the call over the MB.She pulled out all the stuff and the troubleshooting showed that her old modem was the cause of the problem.I explained to her that she needed a new one and that its no longer in stock because at the time that modem was over 7 years old.

Lady: What do you mean its not in stock?! i want a new one now!

Me: It means that the modem has expired from our stock, it is no longer avalible, but we have another free product that we can give to you in its stead.

Lady: Mhm fine, i sure hope you can send it to me so i have it by tomorrow.

Me: I am afraid that sending this new product to you in such a short notice is impossible due of how the postal service operates. But it will come to the nearest postal service location within 2-3 workdays!

Well now she became out of nowhere really mad.She proceeded to loudly yell at me.

Lady: NO you will send it to me, to MY mailbox by tomorrow NOT to the postal service office!! I don't care how you do it and i expect not to having to pay anything! this is the least thing you can do for me after making we having to endure such a bad internet connection for 3 months and having me call you and wait in a queue for 30 minutes then do YOUR work so we can find the problem! You WILL make what's nessessary so that i can have it by tomorrow.

At this point getting quite upset having her attitude showed in my ear for now about 20 minutes and now she starts screaming at the person helping her?

Me really trying to sound nice: Miss, as i said, that is impossible, and we cannot know if your internet is behaving if we never get a notice from you who uses the internet, i can send... (interrupted again)

Lady: I said i don't CARE how you make it work!!! JUST MAKE IT WORK!

Me: That. is. impossible, i would send it to your mailbox so you would get it by tomorrow if i could. You live approximatly 400km from our storage facility, where the product is sent from and its friday 19 (something) o'clock now. You can expect your package to the nearest postal service location next tuesday or wednesday.

Lady: WHAT?! So i will have to wait 4-5 days for it?! This is the worse service ever! \*Company\* has SUCH a bad customer service!!! (\*Company\* actuarly has the country's best customer service and best waittime for issue resolvement)

Me at the moment had enough of her banchee screetching: Yes. You will have to wait for the package to be delivered.

Lady: Ugh... (Went silent for about 5s) I guess we will get nowhere with that..

Me: No, i am sorry that you will have to wait. But i asure you that the new product will solve your problem.

lady, somehow now calm?: What exactly is this new product?

Me, quite confused by her complete 180: Eugh... its a router that \*company\* gives away for free to all out internet customers as a free rental product.

Lady, again screaming but now completely livid: WHAT?! you're sending ME a router?!HOW DARE YOU?! Don't you know how dangerus those things are?!! i am ALLERGIC TO RADIO SIGNALS!!!

Me quite stunned by the next 720 turn in the conversation again: Eh.. Well if you're feeling unconftible with the wifi running, i can turn it of for you.

Lady, even more angry... how that by this point is even possible: YOU, Y-YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER MY ROUTER?!!!

Me: Well technically its not your router, you borrow it during the time you have inter... (interrupted)

Lady: THOSE THINGS ARE DANGERUS AND DEADLY, how can \*Company\* send out those things FOR FREE when you KNOW how dangerus they are?! do you WANT people to get CANCER?!!!

Me: Lady... i assure you that our router meets the european standard wifi regulation.(Silence except for breathing).

Me: The wifi signal emitted by thi... (interrupted)

Lady: WIFI IS CANCER and cause all manners of sickness! young boy, i am educated and I know ALLOT more than you about these things, i have been reachearching this.

Me, now quite fed up with her BS and no longer gives one F: Oh, if you have knowlage about this? then you should know that the radio signal emitted by our router is at standard 2.4Ghz and that radiosignal is non ionizing. Meaning that the radiosignal does not carry enough energy to excite the electrons in the molecules that builds your DNA enough be flung away from the molecule and damage your DNA structure to cause cellular damage. This signal cannot cause cancer.

Lady: YOU LIE! (She did not try to correct me) And i want you NOT to send me that POISONBOX!you will have to send me a modem instead!

Me: I'm afraid i can't do that.What i just offered you for free as a sulotion to your problem is what we hand out. IF you do not want it, you can feel free to buy your own product from anywhere. Just note that if you do \*Company\* has no support over the product you have bought outside our company as a sulotion not provided by the ISP to a problem that could have been fixed with \*company\* products.

Lady: So you are now FORCING me to BUY a product at another \*company\* to have my internet work?!

Me: Noone is forcing you, you could have our router for free and let me turn of the wifi. but you denied it and want a product that is no longer avalible.

Lady: I will make you the headline of the newspaper, i will report you to the polise for fraud and have you fired!! You are giving away CANCER FOR FREE!  WHAT. IS. YOUR. NAME?! (I gave her my name at the start of the call, but i guess she forgot)

Me: I do not feel comfortable telling you my name. but you can call be Robert (Far from my actual name)

Lady: Do the people at \*Company\* know who ""Robert"" is?

Me: No.

Lady: Wh... what?! WHAT?!

Me: If you want us to send you the free product to solve your problem, feel free to call us again.

Lady: NO I..(Klick)

I think the call duration was about 45 minutes in total and during the time she allways complained about something, it was me, the company, the service, our methods of work and our systems.

After the call i told my boss what have happened and she was supportive and told me that i should have hung up sooner than i did and was proud of me for trying to help that nasty customer. She told me that she have overheard some of it and that i did it good.

"CB = Me, Codebooker, Private Tech Guy Who Does IT Work

RE = Sam (not her real name), the Restaurant Employee, a 30-something-year-old woman who has worked at this restaurant for many years

Backstory: I had replaced the cash register system at a restaurant because the old one died unexpectedly and was very old and in need of replacement. Moved the POS software over to a Dell XE2, and got them a new Elo touchscreen monitor that was bigger and brighter than their old one. They were very pleased with this as it was faster and the big screen was nicer. A day after the install I got a call from the restaurant’s cashier/bartender who handled when customers came in to eat and when they were ready to pay, so she was the sole user of this POS system during business hours. The restaurant’s owner would get on the POS system after hours every day to get sales totals, keep note of this, it’ll be important later. What happened next went like this…

&amp;#x200B;

Cellphone: RINNNNNNG

CB: Hey, thanks for calling -*business name here-* this is Codebooker, how can I help you?

RE: Hey Codebooker, It’s Sam at -*restaurant name-* I’m having a problem.

CB: Okay, what seems to be the issue?

RE: The new cash register system you setup, it isn’t working.

CB: What do you mean it isn’t working? Like specifically what is it doing?

RE: The screen is black and when I tap it, nothing happens.

CB: Okay, are there any lights on the screen?

RE: Yes, a green light in the bottom right corner, it’s flashing on and off.

CB: Okay, that sounds like the PC isn’t on, can you look under the counter for me and tell me if the PC has a green light on it that is lit up?

RE: Yes, it does, the light is solid on (note that the XE2 is turned around backwards so the PSU’s green light faces you when you look under the counter, it allows easier access to the cables)

CB: Have you tried pressing the power button on the back side of the computer, it’s a large square button in the top corner.

RE: Yes, and nothing happened.

CB: And it isn’t doing anything when you move the mouse or tap on the keyboard?

RE: No, nothing.

CB: Are all the cables connected? There shouldn’t be any disconnected plugs under there.

RE: Yep, everything is hooked up. I don’t know what to do, can you just come out here? I have customers starting to come in and I’ll be needing the system to cash them out when they leave.

CB: Sure, I’ll head over as soon as I can.

Cellphone: CLICK, end of call

&amp;#x200B;

So, I dropped what I was working on and hopped in the car and rode 20 minutes over there. I walked in the door of the restaurant and headed behind the counter and as soon as I was behind the counter I noticed that the XE2 was not indeed on, and the PSU light was not lit up. I pressed the power button and the system sprang to life. After about 20 seconds it was booted into Windows and was sitting at the logon screen for the POS software. Then Sam walked over to where I was.

&amp;#x200B;

RE: Great, you fixed it, and that was really fast too. What was the problem?

CB: It was off, all I did was press the power button (motioning to the power button’s location).

RE: Oh, geez, I feel so stupid.

CB: It’s all good, it’s working now, but why was it off? I thought you guys left it on 24/7.

RE: Yeah, we were, I’m not sure.

CB: You mind if I take a look?

RE: No, go ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I looked at the Windows Event Logs and saw where it was shutdown properly right around the time that the owner checks each day’s sales totals. He must have turned it off after he got the totals. So I rebooted the PC into the BIOS and set it to auto-boot 30 minutes before they open each day, then I left and drove back to what I was working on before the call. I haven’t had an issue with them since…

"A more lighthearted tale from healthcare IT.

One day, I got called up to med/surg to help Dr. Awesome.  Dr. Awesome was an ex-Army combat surgeon with multiple tours in Iraqistan under his belt. He was always laid back, amazing under pressure, and well respected by everyone. I don’t think I ever saw him raise his voice to anyone and he was always very courteous with his patients. In short, the dude was awesome.

Seems he was having trouble viewing his charts. No big deal, just have to reinstall the ActiveX control. Five minute job, easy.

I go up there and say hello. As I’m sitting in front of the PC clicking away, he pipes up.

&gt;Awesome: I know it’s not your fault, but this EMR is a real piece of sh!t man. We’re always having problems.

&gt;Me: ….   

&gt;Awesome: It’s like we bought the $500 car of EMR’s. You know how $500 cars are?

&gt;Me: LOL yeah

&gt;Awesome: You buy a $500 car, it breaks down the next day, and you sink all of your paychecks into it until it’s all sorted, but at the end of the day, you still have a hooptie and you can never rely on it.


I’m just nodding and smiling as enthusiastically as I can. Best summary of our situation I’ve ever heard, and as the owner of a lot of $500 cars, I can vouch for that part too.


&gt;Awesome: And I’ve always wondered...who got a kickback on this deal? We could have easily gotten  different software


My jaw is on the floor. I’m probably not supposed to agree, but he’s right, you know.

But he’s not done yet...

**Cut to a few days later**


Dr. Awesome stops by the HD. Seems his laptop needs some help – he’s been having trouble charting from home and can’t figure out why. He said he’d gladly stick around while I worked on it, so I set him up in the cubicle next to mine and got to work.

It was an easy fix – just update his VPN client and reinstall that pesky ActiveX control. I’m tapping away when the phone rings. I look over and it’s my boss, ContractorX.


&gt;Awesome: Hey man, I can answer that if you want

&gt;Me: …. sure, but put it on speaker 

&gt;Awesome: Thank you for calling IT, this is Dr. Awesome, how can I help you?

&gt;Cx: Uhhhh….what? Hi Awesome. This is Cx. Did I call the wrong number?

&gt;Awesome: Nah, this is the helpdesk. What can we do for you?

&gt;Cx: Oh. Uh. Can I speak to Bacon?

I piped up and answered his question and he hung up, sounding more than a little confused.


I was still working on Dr. Awesome’s laptop when ContractorX walked in. He saw Awesome sitting next to me and blinked hard. I guess we really threw him for a loop. Maybe he thought he imagined it.


&gt;Cx: Dr. Awesome, nice to see you. You guys really had me going. ROFL.

&gt;Awesome: Yeah, I always wanted to do that


I laughed, Dr. Awesome laughed, ContractorX laughed, the refrigerator laughed, I shot the fridge. All was well.

"Short and silly user story:

I worked as a CRM admin for a couple of years and spent a lot of time doing support for end-users regarding application-specific problems.

The salespeople were always the neediest users. One of my favorite scenarios unfolded thusly:

Salesguy: Sends email complaining about a perceived problem. This is something he has brought up before. It isn't a problem and is merely how the system works based upon the rules of the business.

Me: Sends a moderately detailed email back describing why the CRM application worked this particular way.

Salesguy: Sends a response to the effect of ""I don't have time to read this (*no doubt bc he had SALES-ING to do!*), I'll just come over and talk to you"".

"First time posting here but thought you might like this one:  

Edited: definitions at the bottom of the post, it would break the flow to explain it in the story.

So I am essentially tier 3 support at a managed service provider, anything from on site discovery to rebuilding networks is in my scope.  
Yesterday one of our clients submitted a ticket stating their SAN had some ""blinky lights on it""

 Before going further it should be noted that we inherited this system from their on site IT support before they opted to use a MSP for IT, so alot of the design was out of our control.

 One of our support techs informs the client of their support contract for the SAN and to request some replacement drives (we verified that all of their VMs were online and that no ESX datastores were offline).

 Several hours later our monitoring platform alerts us that one of the clients VMs has gone offline.  It just so happens to be their file server, so they are appropriately concerned.  We look at the SAN (fwiw this SAN is VMWare aware, so it hooks directly to ESX and is aware of its datastores) and see that the file server datastore is inactive and critical.  Do some digging and discover that the datastore is essentially like 12 drives in....raid5.  There are 2 hot spare drives on the system, but from the logs it looks like the hot spare was correctly engaged, but the datastore still shows offline, even though only 1 drive has failed.  

At this point our familiarity with this particular brand of SAN is fairly limited and they have a support contract, so we decide to engage their support.  At the same time because we have been doing this awhile, we decide I should drive over a 15tb QNAP and get it on their network and begin restoring the file server from backup, this way if vendor support cant bring the datastore back online, we at least have a plan b.  

So I get the QNAP installed on site, configure an iscsi target and iscsi lun on the device, then configure the ESX cluster to see the iscsi lun as a datastore, point the backup software at the lun and kick it off.  

The time is now 9:30pm and we figure the restore is going to take around 15 hours (the file server is not all that big, just over 2tb, but the SANs iops (input/output operations per second) are being crushed by array rebuilding and whatever else vendor support is doing, plus the backup data lives on the same SAN because I'm sure budget constraints lead them to believe that was OK.  Couple that with a single 1gb nic on the QNAP and you can see there are alot of throttles).  

Cut to 2:30AM and vendor support is still working on the issue, they had completed their ""Equalization"" process and were attempting to bring the datastore back online when they decided ""hey, we need to **turn off iscsi on the LUN**....  

Up to this point they had been remotely connected to, of all servers, the backup server (which inherently isn't the issue here), and as soon as they issued the command, the backup vm died.....which also killed their connection to the SAN.  Turns out the LUN that the file server lives on also houses the entire...backup...array...  

It is, at the time of writing this, 6:20 am and the sitrep is that an entire LUN is offline, 3 core servers are dead, restores are impossible to perform, and vendor support is, and I kid you not here, typing commands that aren't real into the cli for the SAN multiple times hoping that maybe the second time they issue the exact same command it will work... 

root@(none) spb:\~&gt; server\_mount all

\-bash: server\_mount: command not found

root@(none) spb:\~&gt; server\_mount all

\-bash: server\_mount: command not found

Maybe third time will be the charm there guys...

tl;dr Vendors are idiots and always put your backup data on a different SAN, or at least it's own LUN.

Raid5 - redundant array of independent disks, just a logical structure of drives where, in a group of drives, 1 could fail without dataloss.

Hotspare - like it sounds, a drive in the SAN that can take over for a drive that fails.  Hot meaning the system remains on and spare being spare.

QNAP - brand of network attached storage, just a device with drives

"Hi everyone, long time lurker, first time poster!

I work taking tech support calls for a security camera company. The line I work in is specific to installers, distributors, and technicians. There is, however, one exception to this policy, where we HAVE to support end users: which is when the units are purchased from a specific distributor.

Cast: 

\- Prad: Me, humble tech support agent.  
\- (Inner Prad: My thought process)  
\- Caller: Angry man with two cameras that aren't working but is not on site.  
\- Wife: Angry woman who is in front of the unit. 

Prad: Thank you for calling tech support, I'm Prad, what can I do for you?

Caller: Yeah, my cameras are grey.

(Inner Prad: Gray? They're probably stuck in night vision)

Prad: No problem sir, let me verify some information and I'll help you!

Caller: \*Verifies information, specifies that he is end user from the one exception\*

Prad: Thank you! So, when you say your cameras are grey, do you mean the picture is in grey scale?

Caller: \*Takes 10 minutes explaining how the cameras are just a blank grey screen\*

(Inner Prad: Oh, easy, we default the cameras, change the cable and we're good to go)

Prad: Ok sir, please connect a WINDOWS laptop to a port on the unit. (Windows is necessary to access the cameras via IP address on IE)

Caller: Oh, I'm not in front of the unit, but my wife is! Let me get her on the phone.

(Inner Prad: \*Sarcastically\* Yay, conference calls, nothing could go wrong)

Caller: \*Says hello to Wife, explains that he's talking with tech support in an angry tone.\*

Wife: \*Replies in angry tone and asks for instructions\*

Prad: Do you have a windows computer with you?

Caller: \*Repeats the question to Wife\*

Wife: I heard him!, yes I do.

Prad: Ok, please connect the computer to any port on the unit with an ethernet cable.

Caller: \*Repeat the exact words Prad just said\*

Wife: What?

Prad: \*Provides detailed explanation of the connection, along with descriptions of what the cables and ports should look like, specifying we need a windows pc\*

\*Pause, 2 minutes\*

Caller: So, how's the connection?

Wife: It's rebooting now?

Prad: Sorry?

(Inner Prad: How did we go from connecting a cable to rebooting the unit?)

Wife: Well, Caller told me to restart the unit, so I did that.

Caller: I did not!

\*Verbal argument starts, lasts a while\*

(Inner Prad: This is awkward, I don't want to be here)

Caller: I did not tell you to restart the unit. Prad, did you tell her to do that?

"I'm a developer at a mid-range BPO company. I recently made an in-house password management application because our phone agents can't remember their logins. It's particularly bad in our line of work, because a forgotten login can keep them from being productive for 30 to 60 minutes while it's reset. Before this they were storing their passwords in text files, but due to a company wide mandate all of our agents had their access to any kind of text editor removed. Naturally, I field basic support questions for the application since I'm the only one with any real familiarity with how it works.

I got an email a week ago from a manager (Mgr) absolutely livid with me and the application. He has an agent who claims their passwords are just gone. This is how the conversation proceeded:

Me: Okay, give me some quick reproduction steps. I need to know what the agent did.

Mgr: He just had them one day and the next they were gone. You need to fix this right now. They're not being productive and it's your fault!

Me: That doesn't explain anything, I need step by step what he did.

Mgr: He says they were there last night when he left, and when he came in today, they were gone. I checked, there is nothing in the application.

(Repeat this same loop 4 times)

After that fruitless conversation, I tell him to have the agent re-enter the passwords he can remember. At the same time, I use our remote monitoring software to watch his screen. The manager comes back 10 minutes later.

Mgr: They're in there now.

Me: No they aren't.

Mgr: Yes they are, I saw him typing.

Me: Well I watched the screen. He didn't even open the application. I've got the video if you wanna see it.

I play back the recording. Mgr watches, eyes wide, as the agent moves the cursor around for a few moments, and then the highlighted icon on the desktop shifts around, indicating that they're typing on the desktop. Pretty sure I got the guy fired. I did eventually get an apology from Mgr over the ordeal. The application is used by 1500 people on a daily basis and has been for months... so an odd out of the blue catastrophic failure is beyond suspicious. As best I can tell, the guy wasn't using the system at all, and when he got caught (probably by forgetting a password), he panicked and said my application was at fault.

EDIT: Quick update, While it's clearly easily possible to defeat the mechanisms in place, I had no hand in how they went about banning text editors. The general idea is to make it difficult for the vast majority of people, and catch those few who are smart enough to pull it off. Anyone who knows enough to bypass the restrictions, isn't likely to hang around in a job that pays $10 an hour.",My passwords are gone and it's your fault!,0
"So where I work we got a 4 floor building with several multifunctional printer/scanners spread out over the building, I think a dozen in total. When their inkt cartridges run out or the waste toner gets full, we get a mail message to warn users and us about it. Most of the time we place cartridges and waste toners in cupboards near the multifunctional printers so users can change it for themselves (being a 24/7 workplace and all). The printers auto-order new stock as needed.

Recently we noticed empty waste toners piling up in our supply so we figured that we had been overlooking the need to place them in the building. Shortly afterwards we get a notification mail that a waste toner was almost full and would soon require changing. One of our IT-team members goes out with a new waste toner to the multifunctional printer. He goes to the menu of the printer to check how much waste is in the waste toner.

0% full. No waste was present in the toner. He figures that that is strange and figures he will need to check notification settings on the printer. Before leaving he tells people that he will place the new empty waste toners near the printer. He opens up the cupboard and sees a pile of waste toners laying there unopened. He goes to ask the people what they do when a waste toner is full.

""Oh, we just dump the waste in the trash bin.""

The highly flammable and cancereous waste....is just dumped....in the trash bin. Apparantly they found a way to open the waste toner (normally for safety reasons it only opens when inserted into the printer) and used it to dump it in a trash bi We are very glad we don't have any users that require us holding their hands through everything, but this might just be a bit too much of the ""we'll figure it out ourselves""-mentality.",We just throw it in the trash,0

Normally they call IT when there is an issue with a computer in the library (we have over 500 computers, so calls go out regularly), however they decided to call IT to come and look at the microwave.The ticket in the system was blank, so somebody from IT came here and thought that there was a ""normal"" computer issue.

"I got my start in support in the pre-personal-computer era while working for a cable company in Southern California.  We had a few actual computers, but mostly there were dumb terminals on a token ring network.  I was supporting the in-house PCs (80286@16MHz), but my main responsibilities were as backup to everyone.  I was trained to do everything, so when someone called in sick - I was the fill-in guy.  If an installer called in sick, I knew how to do installs.  If the dispatcher called in sick, I dispatched.  My normal schedule put me in the office at 11AM and I was there until closing.

As the closer, I had all the keys, and all the codes for the alarms.  I also took the last two hours of support calls before shutting down the phones.  That meant I got calls from every person who forgot they had an installation appointment and was pissed that they had to wait 3 or 4 days for the next available install slot.

Then one night, I got THAT call...the one that opened my eyes to the possibilities of the power I held in my pocket (the keys to everything).

The customer called in a near panic. He just moved into his apartment, invited all of his buddies over to watch ""the big game"", and while he was busy taking care of the minutia in preparation for his party - he forgot to be home for the cable guy.

What opened my eyes was something he said.  ""Don't you have someone who lives in the area who can come and install this?  I can pay him! What will it take?""  It was then that I realized - I live in that area....and I'm going to be off work in 15 minutes....and I have access to all of the equipment I need...it's in the warehouse....I won't even be taking anything out of a service vehicle...this is all the extra stuff.  I can take the paperwork, fill it out like a normal install, and put it into the system tomorrow when I get to work......nobody will know...it will just magically be completed.

This customer had awakened my inner schemer.  I told him that I'd get in touch with a tech that lived in the area and see if he was available.  The guy said ""tell him I'll pay him $50 if he can come right now"".  So I put him on hold for about 5 minutes, and when I came back I said ""The tech can be there in 30 minutes (about how long it was going to take me to get there after locking up the shop).

Not only did everything go as planned.  The customer got his install, I got $50, but I also had a couple of beers and pieces of pizza when the install was complete (it was a party after all).

That became a regular gig for me.  I would lay out all of the local missed installs in the dispatch office after everyone else left for the day and wait for someone who was desperate for an immediate install and quietly suggest that there was a tech who lived in the area who might be willing to make a late night call.  Eventually it expanded to people who were non-pay disconnects.  Someone would forget to pay and wanted a reconnect after-hours.....I'd take their check and an extra $whatever-they-offered to take care of it.

For a 19 year old kid, making an average extra $200 per week under the table in the early 90's was awesome.  Some weeks I made more in after-hours service than I did in my regular paycheck.",Sort of a side gig,0

I launched a file recovery program we keep, and started the scan.  Two minutes later, the client was nagging at me to ""hurry up and just recover the file.  It's not that difficult!"".  Five minutes after that, they are yelling at me to ""speed things up, because you're going to make me late!""

I tell them that these scans can take three or more hours and that they cannot use their computer in the meantime.

"I work in a tech support team for a decent sized organization. We get a lot of interesting questions, a lot of them about printing and photocopying, but I think these stories are my favourites:

# Printing Videos

&gt;User: Can you help me print a video?  
Support guy: How would that work?  
User: I don't know, that's why I came to you guys

(they weren't wanting to print a still frame, and it took them about 10 seconds to realize what they were asking wasn't possible)

# Photocopying into Colour

&gt;User: I printed this photo \[in black and white\]. Can I photocopy it into colour?

# Fallen Exit Sign

A few years back one of those (unpowered) green exit signs fell down at reception during a two week break. Someone found it and rested it on the bezel of the receptionist's screen, leaning the sign against the LCD panel.

I had a call from the receptionist

&gt;Receptionist: Hi David, I've got a green exit sign picture on my screen that won't go away  
Me: Uh.. an exit sign.. picture?  
Receptionist: Yeah, you know the stick figure running out the door on a green background? That. I can't get rid of it, even when I turn the screen off and on. I think it's burned in.  
Me: That's interesting. I'll pop over and take a look

By the time I got there, the receptionist had worked out that it was a sign and was having a good laugh about it. 

I believe she did the same thing with a post-it note someone had left on her screen, but I didn't field that query so I don't know for sure.",Printers and exit signs,0
"Yet another installment in the tale of the evil $RegistrationHead and her many employees.

Thanks to some recent 'improvements' at the helpdesk, we were down to 2 people on day shift. Ordinarily, that might suffice, but $Hospital was small enough that helpdesk handled phone calls, PC deployment/repair, and application support...



It was 7am and I felt like a man treading water with a brick on his head. The phones were ringing incessantly and our wonderful schedule meant that, for the next few hours, I was THE IT department. 


I was dealing with $RN1 and $Doctor1 when the phone rings again. Caller ID says **FRONT DESK #2**. 


F$cking great. That was Cathy's office. Just what I needed. She was just going to have to leave a message, and I'd get to her when I had the time. Probably just can't figure out how to login. 


A few minutes later, I'd managed to stem the tide of phone calls, so with a sigh, I girded myself for 
battle and dialed into the voicemail system.

&gt;VM: Hi, this is Beth. I'm working in Cathy's office today and the computer won't start. Please call me back.

Relieved that I weren't dealin' with Cathy today, I called her up.


&gt;Me: He11de$k, Bacon speaking, got your voicemail, how may I help you?

&gt;Beth: Hi, this is Beth. I'm up here in $front_office and the computer keeps shutting off. Every time I restart it, it says something about cooling fan failure. Can you come look at it? We've got a room full of clients waiting and $RegHead is getting flustered already.

&gt;Me: *f$ck* Tell, you what, that's not good. I'd go ahead and shut it off before it cooks itself. 

&gt;Beth: Well, it has been running for a little while already. I'll just leave it alone until you get here

*sh!t* At this point, I still had hope. They didn’t open until 7am, so there was a chance that it hadn't been running long.

&gt;Me: OK. Honestly, if it is the fan, the computer might be dead already. How long is 'a little while'? Five minutes? 

&gt;Beth: Hehe. More like twenty minutes. I got here early today.

*le sigh*

&gt;Me: OK, I'll be up there as soon as I can. Go ahead and shut it off in the meantime.

&gt;Beth: OK, thanks! 

*click*

Of course, as soon as I started to walk out the door, the phones blew up. After a solid ten minutes of password resets and going Schwarzenegger on Citrix sessions, I finally headed up to see Beth.

As I walked down the hall, I noticed a smell, but I couldn’t name it. By the time I got to her department, the smell of hot plastic filled the air. Strange, I thought, it doesn’t *smell* like burning PCB...


I walked in and sure enough, the smell was coming from the PC. I leaned over to to unscrew the PC from its mount on the back of the monitor, but it was wayy too hot to touch. It’s dead, Jim. At that point, I started having nightmares of $RegistrationHead bursting in and screaming. Dead reg PC’s were bad news. Then I realized it had only been a day or two since the training room incident and RH was very much a ‘shoot the messenger’ person. Dear God, don’t let her show up now...if she shows up while I’m in the middle of unhooking this PC, she’s going to loose her mind.

As I stood there waiting on it to cool, RH burst into the office and immediately started yelling. She was quite insistent that it be fixed ASAP, wanted a guarantee that it would be fixed in a few minutes, etc, etc. 

This made me sweat. Getting it resovled in a hurry would be near impossible; registration PCs needed a lot of specialty software loaded, but due to software licensing issues, we deliberately didn’t keep a hot-swap PC for them. RH knew this, because she did the UAT for their software when it was implemented and wrote the workflow for her staff, but that didn’t temper her anger when I told her it would be a few hours before we could get Beth back up and running.  To Beth’s credit, she was defending me and trying to explain the situation to RH, but RH was having none of it.

Right about the time she reached peak unhappiness, my phone started ringing. Caller ID said it my boss, ContractorX. He wanted to know if we notified the COO that there was a registration PC down.  Why would the COO care? Why did they expect me to call them? When did this policy start? We’d never done that before. To this day, I have no idea, but I was losing it inside. The pressure of being the only IT staff was bad, Cathy’s PC being dead was worse, RH’s screaming was making me grit my teeth, and Cx panicking in my ear over the COO’s unhappiness was about to make me clock out and never come back.

I took a deep breath, and mumbled a few halfhearted promises to RH, tucked the hot PC under my arm and nope’d out of the situation as fast as possible.

I got a new PC setup in record time, and we had Cathy’s office (mostly) back in action an hour later. Autoprinting still had some quirks, and RH made sure to let us know how unhappy she was about that, but that was a known issue, and at that point, that was small potatoes to me. Given the shambles that was our registration software, as far as I was concerned, doing it in an hour was a minor miracle, so I was happy that that was all they could find to nitpick.

In the end, the new PC ended up being a bit more trouble free than the old one, but it didn’t stop Cathy from being our most frequent caller for the next several years. Small victories, right? 

Thankfully, this incident was the end of RH’s rage fit. As time went on, RH actually became an ally to IT, and under different circumstances was quite reasonable, but that’s another kettle of fish entirely.

"Just had one that made the think - what are some analogies you guys use to explain computers to the non technical types?

For example: Yesterday I had a user rush out of a team meeting and grab me mid DHCP migration because ""the (presentation) screen is all jumpy and flickery"".  I halt my work and walk to the meeting room where indeed the screen is all jumpy and flickery. Not due to any fault of the physical gear or PC itself, but because they were trying to run a 3D rendered VI type design demo (I work for a construction firm) on a low level meeting room PC designed for powerpoints and word documents. 

I initially blurted out ""Oh I see, this PC's CPU and lack of GPU can't handle anything that demanding so it's causing the screen to flicker and jump"". After a dumbfounded look from the initial reporter and all meeting attendees I switched to analogy mode:

""Ok guys - right now you're trying to pull a very large caravan down a highway with a Nissan Micra. You might get there in the end but it'll jump around like crazy and stands a very high chance of crashing en route."" 

That seemed to click with some so I went on my merry way.

"Sadly, no pictures, will add it if I can find it. 

A while back I was working as an IT provider for a major cable company down here in Mexico. As part of my duties, I was also in charge of documenting and determining fault in cases where problems in instalation on part of our workers had, in fact, damaged our user's personal property. This is one of those stories. 

So, it started when I recieved a mystifying note on one of my ""damages"" jobs. "" Electrical fault, damaged tv"". Usually the notation is not that specific, its usually ""Tv may have problems"" when the screen got smashed to bits by Dan the Repairman for the second time this week or so. The Damages people never try to admit fault. 

So I arrive, greet the customers and before I even note how unimpressed they are I notice the smell. Its an intense penetrating smell, like when you left your  silly plastic spatula on the open fire of your stove and melted it. So the guy leads me to his living room, and I can kinda see the problem.

The cable box caught fire. Apparently it burned very fast and very insensely, because it made the underside of the tv where it was installed catch fire too. By this time I am aware there is zero to no chance of the cable company not admitting fault here. 

After talking to the client and watching the damage I piece together what happened. Dan the Repairman klutzed it up again. The  coaxial cable that goes into the box was installed from the pole. It carried a couple thousand volts from another line down to the cable box, which promptly died and catched fire. The HDMI port on the tv was also badly burned, and the main board of the TV was probably also fried, so there was no way anyone was gonna fix this tv.

"Just recently went to a small office site with  3-4 employees to help out a co-worker and was delighted to be told by the one of the staff ""I know more than you about this than you"" and ""You don't know what's involved in doing my job"". They are a clerk- data entry, reading emails, word processing and some spreadsheets.  They only call when they need something- ie its broken, fix it and  they have no regular maintenance.

The reason we were there? They managed to get hit with one of the crypto infections  kissing their CSM database goodbye and we were getting things cleaned up and restored. At least they had a semi-current backup. Windows 7 machines and a CSM about 7 versions out of date. Sweet. A main feature of their business is receiving unsolicited 3rd party email, with attachments on one of the regular networked PCs.

Now for the good news- CSM is too old to validate the license for their version, support ended 3-4 years ago. Guess what- you are going to have to go with the web version of CSM and pay for the conversion of your data to the newest schema. Also you need to update to latest window OS,  Maybe your hardware will be above the min requirements, but you will definitely have to pay to get updated (labour and license). And they still plan on opening email and looking at attachments from people they don't know, cause, hey ""I know more than you about this than you""","I know more than you, and you don't know what I do",0
"Early in my career, I used to work for a small public library as the assistant to the IT Manager. What that usually meant was taking care of the people who used the public computers. I have many stories, but this is one of my favorites.

Users without a library card could ask for a guest pass from the Information Desk. We would generate a one-time password (alphanumeric) for them that would print out on a receipt. They would take said receipt to the computer, type in the password and have access.

Easy.

One day an angry woman comes in and demands a guest pass. Done. She stalks over to the computer, plops down and starts to type out the password.

"I've written about the $2/minute help desk before.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the most expensive call ever received at that desk (up until the point when I resigned)

&amp;#x200B;

My position on the per-minute help desk was that of a manager. I was promoted up from a phone tech several time, and given an elite department to manage. I was basically the highest point of escalation in my help desk organization.

&amp;#x200B;

Callers had to go through the regular per-minute techs (superstars), to senior techs (computer gods), and if they couldn't figure it out - that's when I received the call (the smartest guy in the room). I spent a good portion of my time screwing off, because when you've got a team of the best-of-the-best techs, not much escapes them. I only answered the phones on a 2nd escalation (super rare) or when we were getting slammed (because $2/minute isn't beneath me.)

&amp;#x200B;

The twice escalated caller had purchased 2 top-of-the-line computers (like $2500 each), and professional in-home setup. Her first issue, the store delivered the computers to her driveway, in boxes, and drove away. She was pissed. I don't recall the exact amount, but I want to say it was more than $1000 for the installation - and they just drove away....they didn't even take it inside.... That was the first part of the call - a good old fashioned rant. I listened to everything she had to say, because $2/minute.

&amp;#x200B;

She was not a dumb lady. Not a computer person, but not dumb. Most computer peripherals are keyed, so she didn't have much trouble unboxing and setting up the computers. One in her office, and the other for her kids. I liked this lady because she wasn't helpless. The setup didn't happen, so she did it herself; for the most part everything was set up correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

Her order included 2 complete computers, monitors, keyboards, mice, speakers, HPNA (phone line ethernet) and internal PCI DSL modems. I questioned her about the DSL modems, asking if she had 2 separate DSL lines and she confirmed that she did NOT. So, a salesperson didn't understand how DSL worked and assumed that she needed 2 modems for 2 computers - this was not a surprise to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Then we got to the actual reason she called for support. Both computers worked, but not at the same time. She could have the computer turned on in her office, but while it was on - the kids computer would not turn on. When the office computer was off, the kids computer would turn on - but while it was on, the office computer would not turn on.

&amp;#x200B;

We spent time going through all of the wiring. She verified that the office and kids rooms were not on the same breaker. They were physically separate, because it took the woman 5 minutes to walk from one computer to the other (She spent $6k on 2 computers, I assume she was made of money and had a house to prove it). It was ridiculous! I knew both computers worked, but what was the issue causing them to fail to power on at the same time?

&amp;#x200B;

It was then that I decided to take care of a problem I noticed when we were going through the wiring. Having spent a few years supporting DSL service, I knew there was no point having 2 DSL modems on the same line. Judging the office PC to be the most important, I sent her to the kids room to adjust the wiring of the DSL and HPNA cards. I explained what we were doing, and she agreed that the office computer should be the internet gateway and the kids would share internet via HPNA. So we proceeded to reconfigure the wiring on the back of the kids PC to eliminate the DSL modem.

&amp;#x200B;

That turned out to be the key to the whole problem. I don't have the electronics knowledge to explain how, but I believe that a sync'd DSL modem on one computer would cause something to fault in the PCI bus DSL modem of the other computer, preventing it from powering on. Whichever computer powered on first would cause this error in the DSL modem of the other computer. She could now power on both computers at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

That was the first two hours of the call. The other 8 hours involved configuring networking on the HPNA cards, ICS, VNC (now she didn't have to spend 5 minutes walking back and forth), web content filtering, installing MS Office, kids programs, her work programs...yadda yadda yadda. She had this vision of she wanted everything - and I was going to spend every minute she was willing to pay for to get her set up to do it.

Players in today's story are Me and the Office Manager.

A while back the office manager brought me a walkie charger to take a look at, it's been sitting on my desk for a while, but today I decided to open it up and take a look inside. First hurdle is that it has stupidly deep screw holes (deeper than my usual screwdriver will fit) so first I have to hunt around to find a screwdriver that'll fit in the damn thing.

When I finally get it open, the first thing I notice is that one of the ICs is looking nice and toasty. On second inspection, I notice that all of the ICs have the same halo of doom surrounding them. I figure the unfortunate charger has been the victim of a power surge and go up to the office to reenforce the concept of surge strips.

&gt;Me: Hey Office Manager  
&gt;Office Manager: Hi Vespum, what's up?  
&gt;Me: Well, I took a look at that charger, I think I found the problem.

One of our locations handles payments.  We use Square on a tablet mostly but the manager there also logs in occasionally via PC to check reports, etc.

One day, I updated the passwords and business was as usual.  No problems with the tablet.  However that afternoon, she calls me in a panic because she can't log in via the PC.  I remind her about the password change but she is adamant that she's typing it correctly.

I log in remotely and it's all working fine.  She's frustrated but thanks me and does whatever she needed to do.

The next day, the same thing happens so I go visit her in person.  I ask her to show me and sure enough, it doesn't work.  I watch her type it in and see it fail.

Then I try it and it works.  Huh?

I log out and ask her to type it slowly while I watch closely... and Aha!  I see exactly what is going wrong.

She does most of her work on mobile.  The password has a few capital letters and on the PC, she was hitting the shift key and then letting it go before typing the letter.

"Hey all.  I work as frontline tech support for a SaaS company in the midwest. We handle accounts all over the US and talk to everyone from business owners to ""IT people"" to actual IT support. We help guide these gentle souls through the hell that can be our software when it fucks up. Mostly.

So yesterday, while praying that the 10 people we have working the tech queue are going to be enough for the busy Friday we've been having, I get a call from one of our clients IT people. I love talking to IT because it generally means that I can cut out the hand holding and tell the person who to fix it.

Not today.

IT support guy called in because he has been seeing an error with our software and Outlook. You can email directly from our program using any email program that can handle the mailto: command. Most users choose Outlook because that's what Windows recommends (*cough***pushes***cough*). I still see Thunderbird occasionally though. I digress.

So the user is getting an APPCRASH error when he goes to email from our program. I remote in and take a look (he's still using Windows 7 Pro, FML) at the error. As soon as I do, I can see that it's not our error, it's a Windows side error. We remote in for everything, we're told do do it when we're in training and after a while it becomes habit. User said that he's been dealing with the error sporadically for months and that if he closes everything and reboots the software and Outlook, they play nice.

I tell him that this isn't our error. Almost all of our errors have a code attached to them that we can research. I refer him to Microsoft for more assistance.

The IT guys tells me it's our error and that we need to fix it. While he's bloviating about how long he's been dealing with this issue, I pull up the error in Google and get him a solution. I then tell him how I found it in Microsoft's Knowledge Base. I then get a rant about how all they are is link after link and no solutions (I agree, but I have Google skills this guy doesn't have apparently).

I work for a medium sized company that has multiple plants across the country, my boss and I are based in the same location and are the only two sysadmins/techsupport guys for the whole company.

So we're having a pretty cruisy day, and week so far, only had a user account and mobile phone to setup for a new user when suddenly we have a call come in from one of our plant managers (PM)

&gt;Me: ""Hi, it's Animosus speaking, how can I help?""

&gt;PM: ""Our whole plant is down, WiFi, network cable connections, printers, even the mixer, it's not working and there are 5 trucks in line to be loaded up!""

&gt;Me: ""Ok, it sounds like there is a network issue, are you able to send someone down to check out the coms cabinet?""

&gt;PM ""Yep, I'll get &lt;Plant worker (PW)&gt; to go check it out""

About 30 seconds pass

&gt;PM ""According to PW, it's all lit up and running""

We do some more investigation on our end, speak to the ISP and they confirm there is no network outages on their end, so we book an urgent last minute flight, and unfortunatlely for me I am missing out on my two weekly coffee meet and dinner with some friends, so a little peeved.

4 hours later I arrive at the plant am I am escorted by PW (mentioned earlier) to the coms cabinet, which as it turns out is a little cutout under the stairs where the wall has just been bashed away and network equipment stuffed in there.

Straight away I can see that there is no power running to it, so I turn around to the worker that showed me there. 

&gt;Me: ""You said that it was completely lit up and running?""

&gt;PW: ""Oh yeah it was when I had a look earlier, before my shift, but it doesn't look like it is now""

&gt;Me: ""Ok, but I thought you told me it was lit up after the network went down?""

&gt;PW: ""Oh I thought it'd still be ok, didn't really want to go downstairs again because it's kind of warm""

&gt;Me: ""Well it's not running now, let me have a dig around ""

So I dig around the spaghetti cabling of network cables, power cables and general bullshit in there that has been piling up for about 5 or 6 years, to find that all of the power cables went to a powerboard, which was a cable run through the wall into the locker room, to a powerpoint with a label on it that said:

DO NOT FUCKING REMOVE, DO NOT FUCKING TURN IT OFF, IT WILL SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE FUCKING PLANT (Little harsh but I guess the old old technician really wanted to drive in the point NOT TO UNPLUG IT)

Low and behold, it is unplugged, with a phone charger plugged in it's place, I am completely dumbfounded and just stared at it for what felt like a good five minutes, I've flown across the country, missed out on my coffee meet,  because someone just wanted to charge their phone and didn't bother to read the label??

PW walks in, asks ""Everything alright?"" and then grabs the phone and unplugs it

&gt;PW ""Oh sweet, phones charged!""

I just stutter over my words until I manage to get out

&gt;""y-you unplugged the power cable, that specifically said DO NOT FUCKING REMOVE, DO NOT FUCKING TURN IT OFF, IT WILL SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE FUCKING PLANT.......to charge your PHONE????!?! Did it not occur to you that this is the reason the plant hasn't been able to work for the past 5 hours?""

PW just shrugs and says 

&gt;""Nah not really I guess, thought it was just some of the lads having a laugh, you know what locker rooms are like haha""

Well I just am left speechless, I plug it back in, walk up the stairs and make sure that everything reconnects back to the network, then drive to my hotel and expense a shitload of cider to my work because fuck, I wasted an evening I was looking forward to for someone charging their phone.

Since then we have had a power point put into the coms room, and upper management has told all plant workers that they are not allowed to charge their phones at work anymore and must get a manager to check the coms room if we have network outages in future.

TL:DR Worker unplugs power to the coms room to charge his phone and doesn't think the label on the power socket is real because ""It's the lads having a laugh""",Our whole network is down but at least my phone is charged,0
"One of my IT jobs was client-facing phone support for a company who supplied consumer and business PC postage solutions. We sold scales too so people could weigh their shit.

This is an account of my favorite call. 

Entities: Me, Caller, Company.

*Auto-attendant beeps

Me: Hello, this is Me, thanks for calling Company, what can I help you with? 

Caller: I can't get this scale to weigh anything. You guys sold me this scale and I need it for my business. I'm going to cancel this account because your product sucks.

Me: Yikes, OK, let's see what we can find. Is it connected to both power and the computer?

Caller: Yes, both, I just traced the wires and I see blinking lights. I know it's connected right.

Me: OK, great. Let's validate app and driver status.

[Remote in: Nothing wrong found in settings. Customer removes item, replaces item on scale: 0 action.]

Me: Huh.  Can you find any identifying information on the scale so I can look up the KB for this model? A model or revision number?

Caller: Well it's gray, square, flat, plastic, has a power cable and another cable that goes to the computer. It doesn't have a readout but it does have blinking lights. I have a heavy box on it RIGHT NOW and the computer isn't reading it. Are you sure you know what you're doing?

Me, politely: Are you sure it's our scale? There are third party scales which might not be compatible.

Caller, not politely: YES ITS YOURS I PAID EXTRA FOR IT 

Me: OK, well let's get that model number. It's on the back [describes location]

Caller, even less politely: IT'S NOT THERE. I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

Me: Let's back up. What words are written on the back?

Caller: [pause] Link System.

Me, frantically waving at the QA desk to audit my call: Do you mean, Linksys?

Caller: Yes, Linksys. That's who made this scale.

Me, calm as you like: Can I place you on a brief hold? I need to verify something. Thanks.

[Verifies that no, in fact, Linksystem doesn't make scales. I just had to be sure. CYA people.]

Me, back: Hi Caller, I think we have it. There's no easy way to say this, but that's not a scale, that's your internet router, and you may want to remove the box from on top of it.

Caller: [mortified soul death sounds, shameful weeping] 

Me: I can see how you might feel that way, let's get the scale installed. [Describes scale just to be sure.]

Caller: Oh is THAT was that what that other box was. 

Me: 

Caller: You're going to post this online, aren't you? Tell everyone how dumb I am?

Me, lying: No ma'am, we are professionals here. [Installs scale] Looks like you're good to go, thanks for calling Company, have a great day.

"This week I was working on a project to move an industrial facility. I'm an industrial engineer and our job was to make sure the expensive automation equipment didn't get damaged in the move and was unloaded in the right place. As I was walking through the offices of the new facility with a colleague, C, an older shipping clerk who we'll call Dorothy stopped us and needed help.

Dorothy: ""Can you two help me, I need to print this paperwork, it's extremely important to print today and the new printer doesn't work""

C: ""Did IT come by and set up your network printers on the new server""

Dorothy: ""I thought you guys are IT""

Me: ""No, we're IE, industrial engineering, different department, I don't know the new server address off the top of my head but there are some IT guys in the server room, I can get one of them for you""

Dorothy: ""You sound like IT guys""

Dorothy: ""We're in luck, the UPS driver is here! he's an IT guy.""

Me: ""Umm what?""

Dorothy: ""Yeah, all UPS drivers are IT, they have to carry around the little hand computers""

It was at this point that we realized that she did not know that IT was a specific profession, but rather, she thought it was just a generic term for anyone who was proficient with a computer.

"I spent a few months moonlighting as a technical consultant for a network hardware manufacturer....actually...they make everything, but I was representing them for their network hardware.

A couple (Joel and Susan) was directed to me regarding some network hardware for their business, and I helped them out as best I could (making recommendations, suggesting topology, etc).  By the end of the conversation, they seemed confused - and that's because one was the owner of a light fixture company and the other was his girlfriend and a lawyer.  Neither of them had any experience setting up anything like what they needed done.

So they asked if I was available to set these things up for them; my contract made no restrictions against doing that work, so I accepted. 

It took a couple of days to get all of the cables run and routers/switches configured for their POS and inventory systems, but it went well and everything worked out as expected. In their minds, it went so well that they invited me to be their once-a-week-or-so on-call tech.  For their part, they were pretty consistent.  I'd get a call around the end of the week to pick up some piece of hardware and install it, or repair something, or run some new ethernet....

I would go to their office, or either of their homes (I'll get to their homes in a moment) and do general maintenance or installations about once a week.  Sometimes they would be out of town, or they might not need anything done and I'd get a week off - but they were generally pretty consistent.  I'd get paid travel time to their location, and then an hourly rate while I was there.  It was good for a couple hundred dollars a week for an afternoon of work.

If I happened to be working at one of their homes around dinner time (Susan bought the house next door to Joel after they got serious), then I was invited to dinner - which was super weird, because Joel was a big meat-eating manly man, and Susan was a vegetarian.....but Susan did all the cooking.  She made great steaks!

One evening, I get a call about 8PM (way later than normal for them) because their printer wasn't working.  Joel had a big presentation to a client the next morning and needed to print out a bunch of things - but couldn't get it to work.  I went through the normal phone stuff, network connectivity, power switches, printer queue....and Joel said ""no man, I tried all that - please come right away, this is really important.""

So, I packed a bag with some gear and drove the hour to his house.  When I got there - I shit you not - I walked in, pressed the power button on the printer, and pages started shooting out. I looked up at Joel and he said ""huh...are you hungry?  We have steaks!"".  Susan was behind him with a smirk, shaking her head.

To this day, I'm fairly certain that he was playing dumb so I would come to dinner and he didn't have to eat steak alone and that Susan was shaking her head at the lengths he went to to have a meat-eating buddy over for dinner.

Joel and Susan were weird, but I really liked them.",More money than sense...,0
"I work support for an ISP. Had a call yesterday after a cable had been cut due to someone being a bit careless with a digger. Customer called in around 6pm.

C = Customer

M = Me

&gt;C: Hello. My internet isnt working!!! Why hasnt it been fixed yet?! Someone is digging in the street outside and i think they've cut the cable.

&gt;M: We've been informed of this and our technicians are on it and will have it back up as soon as they can. Given that it is late afternoon they wont be able to do anything aobut it today.

&gt;M: Neither were we. This wasn't planned in any way, the people that cut the cable called us 15-20 minutes ago to let us know. And like I said the technicians are already informed of this. 

&gt;C: THEY CUT IT ON PURPOSE?!

&gt;M: I'm certain they didnt, and that it was an accident.

&gt;M: If it is not fixed within a reasonable time(1-3 working days for regular customers) we always adjust the payment on the next bill for the time you were without our services.

They apologized on the spot, but that was not good enough in my books. I closed the door in their face, went back to eating lunch and went down at 1400 to their office.

"A little background to get You around:

I worked for a hotel company that got divided into four parts, three of them got transferred to other owners and the fourth one was left with things no one really wanted, and was prepared to dissolve. Since I worked as sysadmin in the divided company, I managed to stay in touch with those freshly created ones, because in fact they were made from departments taken away from the divided one.

All of them used one hotel management system, which was also a pain, because of GDPR and other privacy and economy-related issues (It was basically one, big database, that would be shared among 4 different companies. It doesn't sound well right as it is, and it would get worse). I've migrated those companies to their own servers, and by this one simple trick, I became sysadmin in all of them.

So here I am, about one month after successful migration, going to the one of the new companies HQ, to check if everything is working properly and eventually discuss some things with their own, hotel IT-administrator.

The first thing that's off - he is on holiday. Okay, I've been there many times, I can handle myself. Due to traffic jams, I came a little bit later than expected, so everyone was already gone, except for one receptionist, who gave me the keys to my room. Having some free time, I plugged my laptop to the TV (ah yes, always have some additional cables in my backpack, and HDMI has proven its usefulness once again) and watched some movies.

Then I heard a loud ""BANG"", which caused power outage everywhere in the hotel. Ok, since I don't have anything better to do, I check at the reception in the lobby. Surprisingly, they also heard the bang (I was on the 4th floor), so it must have been something big. After a few minutes, I got a call from other department of this company:

\[Dept.\] -The reservation system is down, cause we can't login.

\[Me\] -Yes, I know, you have power outage in the HQ, we are currently working on it.

It turned out that the power box (i.e. that box with meters and main connection, where ""Power company lines"" become ""our lines"". It works this way that their technicians can't touch our stuff and vice-versa), simply exploded. It did that in a funny manner of exploding right before the connectors, so it took a while before we managed to prove the power company that the problem is on their side, so they have to send their people to fix it.

Okay, the power is back on line, I'm booting up reception PC to check if nothing crashed, my new receptionist friend checks fire alarms and other devices- everything seems to be working.

Then I get another call from that department which called earlier:

\[Dept.\] -Eh, guys, how long will it take you to fix it, cause we have guests that need to be checked-in to the system.

\[Me\] -What are you talking about, it should be online right now.

At this moment I'm trying to login from the reception PC, which is in the same network as the server- I get no answer from it.

\[Me\] -Okay, hold up a sec.

I go to the improvised server room this other guy made up in a control room of a bigger conference hall and see servers being out cold.

YES - that guy just set up a server containing peoples' personal data, on a floor in a room where everyone can waltz in, provided they need access to microphones and projectors (and they usually need it during presentations in huge hall) AND didn't even set it up to turn on after power outage- **something I told him to do personally (I remember that), since I cannot just ""teamviewer into"" the BIOS**. There was some UPS standing on top of the server, but it quickly discharged, cause it was the only one, powering 3 servers and a NAS.

Hadn't it been for my arrival, those poor guys would just sit there offline for at least two days, until someone switched the server back on manually. Also, the server with personal data, was just standing in a room without any bigger access control, secured only by some PC-designed UPS...

Whats worst in it, is the fact that I told him to do it- I migrated all the data remotely by myself, set the server up and installed all the required programs on it. His job was to simply pick a safe spot to place that device, plug it in and enter the BIOS to set AC-power recovery, and yet he failed it...",Lucky exploding box reveals how not to let people set things up by themselves,0
"This happened a few weeks back. It was a quiet afternoon at our company for our helpdesk, which gave us time to do all the paperwork that usually is being pushed aside during busy times. Who am I kidding...we were forming balls from wrapping paper and throwing those at one another over the cubicle-walls that seperate us. The two bosses were out, so we could do whatever we wanted to.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly a random phone call appears. I take the call and do the usual greeting. It is a new employee at one of our customers and he is lacking printers on his laptop. I do the usual, check print-server, check the GPOs and his AD-account. All are fine though. Because he sounds somewhat familiar with IT, I ask him to open `cmd` and hit `gpupdate /force`. The printers appear and he tells me that one of his female colleagues is having a similar issue. I tell him to do the same at her computer and call me if that didn't fix the problem. I prefer not to remote into their systems if I don't really have to and try to teach them to fix minor things by themselves. Things like `gpupdate /force` will never harm them. We don't charge them for short calls and if they call us less, then they see us in a better light and stay our customers.

&amp;#x200B;

As I got targeted by my colleagues during that call, I assume for sh!ts and giggles, it was time for payback. I wasn't missing ammunition thanks to them, but sadly I have poor aim. But as one of my IT-teachers (Thank you, Jim) used to say:

&gt;You just have to throw enough sh!t at someone. Some of that is gonna stick!

After a while of throwing wrapping-paper balls around, we proceeded to play with the employee of the month, although (s)he is our newest member in the deparment. The floor-cleaning Roomba.

&gt;Start working!  
&gt;  
&gt;Have a rest!  
&gt;  
&gt;Go charging!  
&gt;  
&gt;Charging!

Those are pretty much the only things it can say and we are trying to come up with a plan to link those sounds with our helpdesk-hotline. So in case that all four of us want to have lunch together, we can still keep that hotline working by letting the Roomba handle those calls during our absence.

&amp;#x200B;

Another call appears and this time it is the female coworker of the previous caller. Since ~~my colleagues cannot wait to target me again~~ I'm already familiar with the problem, it is decided that the best option is to let me handle the case. My colleagues are ~~such bastards~~ so wise.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`I cannot print anything. None of the printers work.`  
&gt;  
&gt;So, you can see all the printers?  
&gt;  
&gt;`Yes.`  
&gt;  
&gt;What happens when you try to print?  
&gt;  
&gt;`Nothing.`  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok, I guess I'll have to login to your session with teamviewer.

I try printing a test page, but nothing happens. I try to check on the print server whether the printer has print-jobs in its queue, but nothing there. The printers are also marked as online and I can ping them from her computer. I open a document and try to print, but before I can actually get there her Word freezes up on me and can only be killed by taskmanager. Just to be sure this wasn't a coincidence, I try it again (and maybe another few times because I'm neurotic), just to meet the same result over and over again. Since I had taskmanager open, I switch to the Service tab and check the spooler. It isn't started.

&amp;#x200B;

Victory at last!!! I start the spooler and try it again, but same result. After a brief period of about another 20 failed tries of the same procedure, I switch to the Service tab again to see that the spooler is still not running. This is odd...well, let's try again. Not starting. I open the services in the proper way to see whether I will get some kinda error message that way and I do.

&gt;0x8..... The endpoint is a duplicate

Since I live in Germany, I get the German version of that message and I put that into Google, as I had no clue what the heck that was for. I usually google with English terms to get better results, but for some reason I stayed with German that time and got weird results. It was mostly about audio not working because of some driver- and faulty-registry stuff. Since that applied to this case in a limited way, I was left with no real clue, but `Something with audio`.

&gt;I know this sounds unrelated, but have you installed an audio device to your system lately?  
&gt;  
&gt;`No, I haven't...wait, well I brought my headset with me and plugged it in. But...`  
&gt;  
&gt;Could you unplug it please?  
&gt;  
&gt;`Uhm...ok...`

I see on the screen that the device was unplugged and start the spooler. It works. I open Word again and go to Print and it actually opens. I select the printer and start it. She hears the printer go to work and then she screams.

&gt;`How fricking awesome is that?! How the heck and what the heck is this?`  
&gt;  
&gt;To be quiet honest, I got no clue and at this point I'm too afraid to investigate any further, as I don't know how long this would take. Are you satisfied with the current solution of unplugging your headset if you want to print?  
&gt;  
&gt;`Hahaha, yes, I still cannot believe it. I doubt I'll ever forget this one.`  
&gt;  
&gt;Me neither. Have a good day.  
&gt;  
&gt;`Have a good day!`

The reason I didn't delve further into this case was that I'd rather ask the customer whether they are satisfied with the current state/solution. They know that making one look into will cost them money. And since we charge 120€/hour, I'd say quite a bit of money. Sometimes you'd rather unplug your headset when you need to print than spending I dunno how many hours worth of troubleshooting in order to fix that problem.

&amp;#x200B;

To give a little context, I'm not working in any kind of commercial tech support but I have been part of my school's tech support back in the days. We've been a group of half a dozen students and we were responsible for cleaning and maintaining overhead projectors as well as handing out notebooks and video projectors to teachers. Having computers in each class room has not been common in our school at this time.

One day, my geography teacher needs a notebook and video projector for her class. She usually uses old wall maps and is not tech savvy at all. She told me, there would be students to help her out if she runs into trouble. So I only reminded her that the battery will only last half an hour, so she has to plug it into a socket.

GT: PS was just about to start her presentation and everything went black. It has worked fine at the presentation before.  
Me: It shut down. Why didn't you connect the notebook's power supply to a socket?  
GT: There is no free socket anymore. There is only one in here and the video projector is connected to it.  
Me: There is a second one under this cover down here. You usually connect your overhead projector to it.  
GT: Oh, I didn't know you can use it for other devices, too. It thought, those projectors are the only thing, you can connect there.

*I rebooted the notebook and was about to leave because I thought, my job was done. But I was wrong.*

&gt;PS: Hey! Stop! The video projector isn't working. I guess, you broke something.  
Me: I'm pretty sure, I didn't, but let me have a look. Maybe the video output is disabled after the restart.  
GT: You know, you are supposed to fix it, not to break anything. Get on with it!  
Me: I know. The video output is turned on. I'll check the cable next. Erm... why did you connect the video cable to the projector's output instead of its input?  
PS: Well, as GT left to get you after the screen went black, I tried to fix it myself but obviously, I couldn't.  
Me: You know, the video input is where the video signal gets into the projector, so you it has already been connected properly before. Just out of curiosity, what made you think that this would help?  
PS: It said 'video out', so I thought, this is what to do if the video... well, goes out.

Me: You don't understand. That's only a link to your file on that flash drive. I'm sorry but I cannot fix it.  
PS: There must be a way to fix it. Please help me. I need a good grade for this or... *she starts whispering* I will fail this class.  
Me: Did you save it somewhere else? If it'll be graded, you have to upload it to the online learning platform. Did you already do this?  
PS: I did. Can I download it from there?  
Me: Yes, you can.

*I did not try to leave this time. I knew better and decided to wait now until she starts her presentation. Instead, I chatted with my geography teacher. She didn't seem angry anymore and was back to her usual smile.*

&gt;PS: Dang it. I can't download it. It won't connect to the internet.  
Me: The reboot might have disabled the connection to the wireless network.

"Tech support is perhaps 5% of my job and things are usually quite smooth.   I manage about 40 devices across 6 locations but it's rarely a headache.  Sometimes, there are things that just make me laugh though.

A number of years ago, we all had our own desktop printers.  They all took the same toner and I usually kept several new ones on hand.  That day, I had coincidentally given those out and was going to pick up more during lunch.

A coworker came to me an hour before I left.  She complained about getting faint printing.  I asked if she knew what a toner cartridge was.  Most of our office is fairly good with technology and they are quite capable of replacing their own toner.  She sounded offended that I'd even ask such a question, saying ""yes, of course!""

So I explain I'd have a new toner for her in the early afternoon but she could probably get some decent pages in the meantime by shaking the toner cartridge a bit first.  I showed with hand motions how I thought it would be best.

A few minutes later, another coworker pages me.  Apparently, there's something I just gotta see for myself.

I make my way over and the lady is really going to town on the toner.  She's working up a massive amount of sweat too.

However, she didn't take the toner out of the printer.  She had picked the whole printer up and was trying very hard to shake it, cords attached but extra paper tray dangling below.

I just stood there stunned in disbelief for a good 15 seconds before telling her to stop.  

I was very polite to her, partially because I didn't dislike her and I can appreciate her taking initiative.  I also very much respected someone of her stature that could do that to a printer that size at such an awkward angle (I forget exactly but it was one of those old boxlike HP laserjets)",Faint printing solution,0

What had happened was that when her husband passed, she called our company to change the name on the account from her husbands to herself, and due to a glitch in the order, the system thought she was a new customer and was being billed as one as well as still being charged for the old account and was being charged late fees, as well as being charged a month in advance for being a new customer.
But that’s not all, she was also charged for moving home.

As I’m looking at this monumental cluster fuck of an account, I see what her bill was supposed to be £20 per month for a phone line, it was now over £200! WTF.

As this is being told to me and I’m seeing it in front of me, i can hear the poor SW crying on the phone, she only had a tiny state pension to live on, how the hell was she going to pay for this bill?

ME: oh my god!...ok, let me tell you the good news first.

SW: alright.

ME: I’m sure I can get rid of most of the charges, the bad news is I’m going to need you to hold the line for quite a while as I deal with all the departments involved.

Note: I cannot call her back as the system automatically switches the account as soon as the call ends.

I then spend the best part of an hour talking to my manager, the credit department,retentions and the moving department, AT THE SAME TIME! On multiple lines all the while I’m still talking to SW.

Finally after talking to all those different departments for nearly an hour and missing my lunch break, I got back on the call.

ME: hi, I’m back again.

SW: oh, hello... did you manage to do anything?

She was such a sweetheart and was so patient with me.

ME: yes I did, ( I say like I’ve just conquered a nation ) your husbands account has now been shut down and all charges have been erased, I got my manager to refund the advance charge on the new account as you are not a new customer, I got the moving team to refund you the moving charge and I took care of the late fees, so now you’re direct debit is back to £20 per month as usual.

SW: oh that’s amazing, thank you so very much.

ME: it was my pleasure and once again I am so sorry about this ( I apologised a lot throughout the call).

After that, her son comes on the phone and firstly thanked me for getting her account settled, and then payed her bill for that moth, so in the end the £200 bill that she was looking at turned into absolutely nothing.

This call really hit me hard because I had lost both my parents earlier that year, and just like SW my dad had everything in his name and my mum didn’t have a clue what to do.

*Yet another installment in the tale of the evil $RegistrationHead and her shamefully inept employees. This little episode happened at least a year after Cathi ruined her PC, so we had been using $EMR long enough for everyone to know better.*


I’m sitting at my desk. Lunchtime had come and gone. The phone rings and who could it be but RH. She’s nearly screaming. From what I could make out, she was in the training lab, trying to train her new staff on $EMR and it’s fairly vomiting errors. Thank god they’re right down the hall?


Sighing, I ambled down to the training lab, and RH accosted me as I walked through the door. Writing this today, I don’t remember what she said because all screaming sounds the same to me at this point, but it wasn’t pleasant, and she kept yelling the whole time I was working.


She was on to something though, as I looked at it, the errors were bizarre. It looked like most, but not all, of the servers were shut down...you could connect, but everything was blank, no data popped up, no matter what you clicked. With the realization that this was over my pay grade, I started spam calling our software team and finally, thankfully got $Rainman to answer. This guy was laid back, very smart and with his slavelike devotion to facts and figures, gave not one single fsck. 


&gt;Bacon: Hey dude, RH is trying to do training and $EMR is broken. Are you guys working on the test environment?

&gt;RM: HAHAHAHAHA. Yeah I’d say they’re having problems, I shut that sh#t down to do a database upgrade.

&gt;Bacon: LOL OK. Was this planned?

&gt;RM: Nah, we just went for it.


RH was *remarkably* unhappy when she got that news just then. She started screeching things like “this is completely unacceptable” and “what am I supposed to do?” before looking around, and proclaiming “Well, I guess there’s nothing we can do here guys, let’s call it a day”. 

As she spun on her heel and stormed out, she was threatening to complain to our manager, etc, etc.

I didn't think much of it then, but this must have really put her in a mood to raise Cain, because her reaction to what happened next was...excessive and ended in her Nth attempt to get me fired.

"I've worked for almost everyone in the big box PC industry.  I got my start in the early 90's, when you could bounce from company to company in search of better benefits or higher salaries every few months and nobody would blink an eye.

When I worked on the Toshiba help desk, I got my favorite call ever.

The woman on the line said that her laptop screen was broken.  RED FLAG!  I informed her that we don't ship them with broken screens, and that unless she received it broken - then it wouldn't be covered under warranty (we could get away with being snarky on the phone back then).  She proceeded to give me her serial number and I started looking things up.

The serial number revealed that the laptop was delivered over a year prior, and that the cost of a screen and labor to replace it was more than the cost of a comparable laptop.  She starts to beg me to make it under warranty, but I really couldn't do anything for her.  This is when she says ""Let me tell you how it happened, and maybe you can find a way to make it under warranty.""

I figured, maybe she has a note from God or something....hearing a story can't hurt anything.  So she begins her story with ""My boyfriend is abusive....""  She goes on to explain how her boyfriend was punching her and she tried to use the laptop as a shield.

Really, I did feel bad for her.  I told her that it still wasn't under warranty, and that's when I gave the best tech support advise of my entire tech career.

"I feel like such a dumb-ass for letting this happen...

So, my uncle bought a beach house on the east coast and organized a large family vacation, to which my wife and I were invited.  Hell yeah! We're going to the beach! The house is HUGE, and every room is decked out with wall mounted TVs, DVD players, and Roku sticks for video streaming.  

The biggest downside is definitely my neurotic, antisocial, suuuper needy aunt (lets call her Nancy), who clearly has no social graces or sense of personal boundaries, and zero chill...she reminds me of folks I've met who have Asperger's or mild Autism except, in her case, dial the ""neurotic and annoying"" meter to 11 and you've got my aunt Nancy. She decides that she's going to spend this whole vacation flitting about, working on and stressing out over every single little item at the property in need of repair.  This includes appliances, furniture and, yep you guessed it, electronics.  She was going to stress and freak over this stuff for the entire 9-day vacation, though I didn't realize it at first.

So we arrive and begin to unpack, greeting our family members as they come in and getting a feel for the place we'll be staying.  Nancy tries to switch on the living room TV, but the remote isn't working.  It turns out the Roku remote needed to be re-paired with the TV.  It's a simple fix; I offer to check it out and get it working in short order.  And then, my friends, I uttered the thing that would haunt me for the next 9 days...I couldn't stop myself...it all happened so fast...

I turned to my Aunt Nancy and (oh you poor, ignorant fool), looked her right in the eyes and I said:

""Hey, I'm an IT technician! Just let me know if you need help with anything!""

#####**UPDATE:**    
Some of you asked for updates/examples from the trip, so I'll copy/paste one of my responses from below.  And yes, she pestered me for the entire 9 day vacation - the worst of which was, I shit you not, the day we were leaving, just as I was in the middle of loading up the car. Anyway, here's more info, including one of our little moments:

&gt;**""Most of it was really, really basic stuff like mis-matched remotes, dead batteries, wrong inputs, and of course the other IT-adjacent stuff like her gas station iPhone charger not working.**

&gt;**Periodically, she'd insist on my help with something, and then once I was there she'd get totally side-tracked, dragging me along as her unwitting hostage. Here's one example: There was a TV witch multiple inputs but she couldn't tell which was which. So instead of just leaving it be, (ffs, just hit INPUT until you get to the one you want!), she insists on taking a deep-dive into the TV settings in an attempt to relabel the display interface itself for each specific input (defaults HDMI 1, HDMI 2, COM, etc) to reflect exactly what was plugged in to each of them (DVD, PC, Cable, etc). And hey, she's got every right to spend her own time fiddling with those settings if she cares that much about it. Unfortunately, she barely understood the remote/TV and had major issues navigating the menus. So she starts trying every single menu option, trial-and-erroring her way thru it, and all the while insisting she needs me there to help.**

&gt;**And I'm just standing in the room with her the whole time, trying to get out of there with a ""Welp looks like you've got this under control"", but she won't let me leave until she's done her little OCD trip. I mean I could have been a dick and just noped the fuck out, but I really didn't want to start any drama with this already clearly neurotic lady...""**

"Okay, so this is my first time... Please be gentle.

I work for a relatively massive IT company in a role that would mostly be considered customer support, but we are a weird hybrid with tech support. The following is a condensed version of my long struggle with corporate to get us some upgrades, since we are a legally vital, country level department.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Okay, so, we need some upgrades. Best would be completely new office PCs everywhere(about 200), but I realize that is unlikely to happen. Can we at least get a second 4 GB RAM stick and a small SSD in our current PCs? (those are our bottlenecks for various reasons)

Corporate: Oh, no no no, that would be expensive.

Me: Those are literally the cheapest computer parts. It would be a drop in the bucket.

Corporate: Sorry, that cannot be done. Besides, your team has the newest set of PCs anyway. If we did have a new batch, you would have to be the last ones to get it.

Me: Wait, what? How old are these?

Corporate: 5 years.

Me: ...what? How old are the rest?

Corporate: Only 10 years.

Me: .....We are supposed to be a first rate IT company... Actually, nevermind. Okay, fine. Then can we at least get an upgrade to \*second most important program\*? You literally have to wait 5 seconds at the very least after every single click, and it is full of things we do not even need, which are slowing it down.

Corporate: What do you mean? We even held a poll and put in the things you wanted.

Me: Literally no one asked for those things. Everyone wanted it to be faster though.

Corporate: Well, we did tell you that that is not a valid request.

Me: ......And what about \*most important program\*?

Corporate: What about it? It is literally the most modern in the industry.

Me: The developers stopped support for our version 2 years ago... It is so slow, we are literally spending half our time just waiting for it to do something.

Corporate: well, we still have a contract to use it for some years...

Me: .......I dread to ask, but do you know all that admin stuff you force us to do besides everything else?

Corporate: Yes?

Me: Here is a list of simple things that would be easy to implement and massively boost speed and efficiency.

Corporate: But we would have to pay the developers to do those, no?

Me: Alright, then here is a program I wrote. You literally just have to get IT security to nod on it, and everyone just has to  run it. It costs nothing, I volunteer as support, and it should make life much easier for everyone involved. It just simulates a very fast user.

Corporate: You are not allowed to put any outside program on these computers! That is strict corporate policy!

"Hi all! So excited to finally post here!

So about three years ago I got hired at a small electric brokering firm to help them develop a new IoT hardware product that would report electricity usage in real time. The grand idea was that by receiving minute-by-minute updates, we could more accurately bill customers and also try to help them save money by sending notifications whenever their usage was abnormally high.

Over the course of that project we went down a ton of rabbit holes to try to interface with power boxes: IR receivers, proprietary wireless protocols, proprietary hardware devices, and finally, the clear winner: magnetism.

See, inside every circuit box in a building, there are 2-4 ""poles"" that current runs through. This current happens to be strong enough that it actually projects a magnetic field around the pole; you can measure said current with special Current Transformer clips like [these](https://www.neur.io/wp-content/uploads/Press-Release-Banner.jpg). If we hooked these up to an Arduino we could measure current usage in real time - problem solved.

Except, we needed to make sure the problem actually was solved. This involved opening up a live power box and installing our clips so we could get readings off of them, to make sure the data we were getting was actually sensible. Now, I'm not an electrician. I just pounce on a keyboard a bunch of times and people seem to be happy with that. There's no way I was going to *clip a piece of metal with my hands to another piece of metal that is carrying power directly from a __freaking power plant__ and connect it to a __$25 Arduino__*. 

Luckily for us, the nice thing about working for an electric company, they actually tend to have a few electricians around.

Scene. Location: Our electric firm headquarters. Basement. In front of the power box.

* Three of my coworkers, who all happened to be friends I had made during my freshman year of college and convinced my bosses to hire. Two CS, one EE who convinced us that completing a direct connection from a power plant to an Arduino was actually a reasonable goal to strive for. 

* Me, a wide-eyed 18-year-old wondering if he is about to watch a man die. Trying to calculate the most optimal place to stand that would avoid most of the fallout from any haphazard explosion / flying carcass while still appearing to be brave enough to stand near the power box.

* Our hero, the electrician, who we'll call Ryan, although his real fake name was George. Ryan was a middle aged guy who listened to punk rock while welding parts for his motorcycle, so I had come to like him in the few minutes that I had known him.

We quickly briefed Ryan on the job, and he nodded as if to say ""this is crazy, but I do crazy."" He set to work while the rest of us watched. Basically [this](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse3.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.U1yLltML_Z1Ly_AnkYOl9wHaJk%26pid%3DApi&amp;f=1), but George was Andre. Tensions were generally high; this was probably the most dangerous thing any of us had ever witnessed at a workplace before.

To be fair, as long as there was no current, the poles should actually be completely safe to touch. Not that I was willing to test that theory, but hey, *science*. What made it scarier is that there wasn't really a good way to verify it: normally with any live wire you can just put a multimeter to it or at least execute the tried-and-true technical operation of putting your hand on it, palm facing outward (so the shock didn't cause your fingers to wrap themselves around the wire.) But with the current and voltages at hand, palm facing outward or not, the resulting force would immediately kill anyone and anything, including most run-of-the-mill $15 multimeters. I'm sure they make industrial multimeters for situations like these, but we didn't have one at the time.

Now, being in the power field, we happen to also run a solar installation business. As such, the building is 100% solar powered on a good day and even on most bad days. As part of the installation, we had this big red switch that disconnected us from the grid entirely, allowing us to be self sustaining. We also had fancy ""smart"" batteries that ran web servers to display their dashboards, so you could set advanced parameters and set up charging schedules and all that good stuff (these become important later on). That made life much easier for Ryan since all he had to do was hit the switch and power down the solar batteries. Once everything was done, it was show time.

Step one: Disconnect from the grid. Red switch flipped, now running totally on solar. Yell into the office for everyone to save their emails and unfinished Word docs because the lights were about to go out.
 
Step two. Kill the batteries. Each battery pack had a power button and an LCD screen; all we had to do was hit the power button twice for the screen to say ""SHUTTING DOWN..."" We shut down all three. Emergency floodlights and cellphone flashlights ON; building lights, printers, punk rock radios, and monitors OFF. A bunch of sensors and random devices start beeping to signal they've switched to UPS power. To reiterate: not only are we scared shitless at what is occurring in front of us, but we are also now totally in the dark with a ton of mysterious beeping noises.

Step three: Cover off. Flip all the breakers just to be totally sure that there is nothing feeding into the poles. Grab the clips.

Step four: Clip the left side first. Approach carefully and, with expert precision, wrap the clip around the pole.

Step five: Boom. Loud bang. Several bright sparks cascading around your vision. Near electrocution. Good, good, all according to plan. 

You know how in CoD your screen turns bright white whenever you get hit by a stun grenade? Yeah. Something like that.

""Now, kids, how come I didn't just die?""

Ryan killed the silence with a sentence only an experienced electrician can be proud of. We are still speechless.

He walks over to the the third battery pack, and points at the LCD:

""UPDATING...""

*Motherfucker.*

My God, I had just become an adult and nearly got a front row seat to watch a man explode because of the IoT equivalent of fucking Windows updates.

""Why...uh...why didn't you die, Ryan?"" I mustered. 

""Well you see,"" he said, powering the third box off for good, ""if you don't work it like it's hot,"" clipping the right side (*without an explosion this time*), ""you're gonna drop it like it's hot."" He grinned the type of shit-eating grin you could only grin after clearly kicking the Grim Reaper in the balls in front of four college-aged bystanders. To this day I still have no idea what he did to completely avoid getting hurt during that fiasco.

And just like that, the clips were in and power was brought back up. The Arduino, thankfully, also did not explode. In fact, our readings were flawless.

What a time to be alive when batteries come with their own computers. Back in my day it was the other way around.

This just happened today. the company I work for does IT support and installations of biometric access (fingerprint readers, photo id badges, access cards) and CCTV systems and different software packages for different needs (door access, time and attendance, etc) but the license on one of the time and attendance programmes we supplied a branch of one of our biggest clients (smallest company we service is about 10 to 12, largest is several thousand spread throughout South Africa and Southern Africa) is about to expire and each user of this program has to email us once we've sent each user steps, in super clear instructions that even my young daughter can understand, how to get the 'activation request file' just so that we can pass it along to our supplier of the program to supply us with the activation code. Below is a briefed up version of the chain of emails between ME and Jack\* (not persons name)

&amp;#x200B;

Me - Good day there Jack\*, my name is willbeonekenobi from &lt;my company name&gt; and according to our records, &lt;Time and Attendance&gt; software is about to expire (14 days left on your install) on your pc. I will need for you to follow the steps below to send me the activation request file that is unique to your pc.

1. Open program and log in
2. Click on 'Configuration' then scroll to 'Registration'
3. Click on 'Save Activation Request File' button. Save this file to your desktop.
4. Reply to this email with just the file that you just created as an attachment.

&amp;#x200B;

Jack - Good day willbeonekenobi. For past few days I've been getting this error message that is in the picture (attachment is a pdf of a printed photo from a potato camera showing that the program is about to expire and will need to re-activate soon)

&amp;#x200B;

Me - That attached picture is why I am asking you to follow the steps in my first email (the one you replied to) as the program is going to expire in 14 days.

&amp;#x200B;

(25 minutes later)

&amp;#x200B;

Jack - Where in the first email are the steps you want me to do? Why can't you do them?

&amp;#x200B;

Me - The steps are at the end of the first email and we do not have access to your pc as that is against your companies IT policy.

&amp;#x200B;

(2 minutes later)

&amp;#x200B;

Jack - And do I have to do this now or later?

&amp;#x200B;

Me - We can do this now or whenever you feel like during the next 14 days to avoid any downtime.

&amp;#x200B;

(35 minutes later)

&amp;#x200B;

Jack - &lt;reply is 424 pages of garbled mess, like user had opened the contents of the file in notepad, and copied its contents into the reply&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Me - Unfortunately that is not what I requested. Please send me the file itself as an attachment.

&amp;#x200B;

(15 minutes later)

&amp;#x200B;

Jack - When I opened up the file I saw it like this. Is this not good enough?

&amp;#x200B;

Me - I need the actual file to pass along to the supplier. I dont need the contents. Please send me the actual file. The file name will most likely be &lt;companyname\_branch\_user&gt;.arqf.

&amp;#x200B;

(3 minutes later)

&amp;#x200B;

Jack - I deleted it. How do I get it back.

&amp;#x200B;

Me- Recreate it using the steps in the first email.

&amp;#x200B;

(5 minutes later).

Jack - Okay I have recreated the file please re-activate. &lt;there is no attachment&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Me - Unfortunately we still need the file.

&amp;#x200B;

(2 hours later)

&amp;#x200B;

Jack - I thought I had attached it, I apologise. &lt;file is attached&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I then immediately send it off to our supplier. 2 minutes later I get a reply with the users activation code.

&amp;#x200B;

Me - Okay Jack, your re-activation code is XXXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXX. To reactivate using this code you just need to follow the instructions in the first email again but instead of clicking on the 'Save Activation Request', you must click on the 'Registration' button. Once you input the code the 'Activate' button will 'light up' and when it does you must click on it. Then your program would be licensed for another year.

Jack - Thanks, software is now working.

This happened recently. Our company provides support to a smaller sister company (more like ugly stepchild).  This includes fiscal, administrative, and internal tech support (among other things).  Their archaic Mitel system was dieing and we were prepping a migration to Cisco, matching what we already have/support.  We were about a week from cutover when the old system died. Luckily we had the new hardware at ~99% config'd (the week away was mostly waiting on paperwork, training scheduling, and a service cutover) so we rush deployed in under 2 hrs.  It also happened to be a minimally staffed week so we only had to train the Administrative Secretary, two Admin, and a few others on site.  I was on site and helping the AS get familiarized with her new phone.

Me: now that the main line is setup on your phone you need to get a voicemail message on setup on it.  All you have to do is select the main line like this [*presses line button*], hit this voicemail button [*presses voicemail button*] then follow the prompts.

*Welcome to Cisco Unity connection...*

Me: [*hangs up call*] your temp passcode is 1234.  When you log in it will prompt you to change your passcode and walk you through recording your greeting message.

AS: ok.  But we should probably have voicemail on the main line.  How do I set that up?

Me: [*stares blankly then shakes it off*] Yes, we setup voicemail on that line.  As I wa...

AS: [*quite interruptingly*] Well then I really need to set that up.  How do I get into the voicemail. It's very important I get that setup soon.  How long until its ready.


Me:  you press this button to select the line [*points at button*] then this one to enter voicemail [*points at other button*]

AS: but what do I press to make sure I'm getting into the main line and not my peronal voicemail.

Me: [*questions reality; points at line button*]

AS: ok, but which button is for voicemail?

Me: [*takes a deep breath to try and hide the sigh*] the button that looks like a tape reel [*points at button*]

AS: What is my pin?  Are they the same as before?  How am I supposed to get in if I don't know my pin?

...I wish I was making this up or over exaggerating it... but this is verbatim, as well as I recall it (from about a week ago).  This conversation went on like this for about 20min for voicemail and transferring calls.  I was later told she recorded her personal voicemail on the main line and the main line voicemail on her personal extension (she had insisted on recording them *after* we had left which is why I hung up after demonstrating dialing into voicemail).

We spent the next few days writing up both detailed and quick reference guides and, after receiving them, every call from AS was her swearing what she needed wasn't on either then us meticulously hand-holding her through horribly simple guides (I should point out, the system is being used successfully yet we have had only one other call since sharing the reference guides, and it was because we forgot to setup their voicemail box).

It warms my heart knowing that she is also the self-appointed tech liaison at the facility and tries to intercept all tech requests before they get to us because she's *oh so good at it and her staff is horrible at communicating anyway*.

TL;DR: walked user through how to use voicemail in new phone system then they proceeded as if the conversation never took place.

"Alright, storytime from when I worked at the worlds worst ISP... TL, DR, Can you read the round dots?   


I worked as upper level tech support, getting the cases tier1 and tier2 couldn't fix...   


phone beeped, as it does to alert me someone wants to talk to me, and I go through my company required paragraph introduction, about how I'm here to help you, and save the day, then give you a loving kiss on the forehead as I tuck you in for the night.... then I hear silence.  Nothing.  well, almost nothing... I hear a very faint whisper just real quiet like... so, I inquire if someone is there, can I help you?   


The whisper comes back, only slightly louder this time...   
Me: I'm sorry, I'm  having a hard time hearing you,   
Her: (still whispering, but at least audible right now)  They're listening, we have to keep this conversation quiet.    
Me: Who's listening?    
Her:  SSSShhhhh  KEEP QUIET THEY'LL HEAR..... (back to whispering) I'm being hacked.  I can hear them on the phones.  little clicks and beeps.  I know they're there.    
Me: ( slightly quieter voice, this is not my first rodeo with someone who doesn't understand how internet and phones work)  What seems to be the problem?  Who am I speaking with?   
Her: I can't say, they'll know then... I already told you, I'm being hacked.  I think they're outside cutting into my phonelines...   
Me: well, if you can just give me your first name, and last initial, I can start account verification...   
Her: Helen J  
Me: ok, would it be ok for me to call you Helen?   
Her: No, I prefer Mrs. Jones...   
Me: ... Ok... No Problem Mrs Jones   


It is at this point, I send a message to my manager that I have an interesting call that I might need help on... He sends a message back saying ""yeah, I got it on speaker back here, and we're all cracking up.... Just keep doing your thing, and don't forget to verify the account..."" Thanks for the support Chris, you're one in a million   


Me: I will need to verify your passcode before I can open your account.  Can you please let me know what that is?   
Her: I can't tell you that, Then they'll know! I know they're listening right now!    
Me: well, if you're afraid of this, what I can do, is verify the account, then put a note on it saying not to accept the current passcode.  Then tomorrow morning, you can go into a local store, and have them update your passcode... but without it, I can't get the account open, and won't be able to fully assist you with your issues.    
Her: They'll hack my cell phone and get the passcode from me again as soon as I leave the store! Plus, what's going to keep them from going in and changing it before I can get there?""    
Me: Well, we require a photo ID, as well as a copy of your bill to make an account change like that.  I can also note the account that no one should change the passcode until you show up to change it...   
Her: &lt;very rushed, and muffled&gt; 3432   
Me: Alright, one moment while I pull open your account please...   


It is at this time a large information flash pops up on her account.... a rather long one, appended multiple times, by multiple departments...   


\-3/22/xxxx-Member says being hacked, hung up phone when I asked her who she thought was hacking her.  tried calling back, no answer.  Modem went offline shortly after.   
\-3/23/xxxx-Member called in on cell phone, said computer not working, and digital phone service not working. I noted her modem was down, and asked her to reset it.  she said it was unplugged. asked her to plug back in, member screamed I'm the hacker, and hung up.   
\-3/24/xxxx-Member demanded we send dispatch to check for hackers on line When tried to set date, she refused to tell me when worked, because hacker would just not be there at that time. hung up.   


\-3/26/xxxx Field tech called in, member modem was missing. Found in closet, along with cable boxes.  set equipment back up, looked around for hackers. assured customer none were here.   


\-3/28/xxxx Field manager called in, DO NOT DISPATCH UNTIL YOU VERIFY MEMBER HAS NOT UNPLUGGED MODEM AND HID IN CLOSET AGAIN.  5TH DISPATCH FOR SAME ISSUE

Well... this just got interesting fast... and of course from the back of the office, I hear my manager laughing as the account flash shows up on his end, followed by ""Hey Sonya, come check this out""   Seriously, thanks for the help there Chris...  


Me: ok, Mrs Jones, I see in your account history that - 

Her: DID YOU HEAR THAT CLICK!! &lt;whispering&gt;they're back in there... it's illegal for them to do this... tell them it's illegal to do this... 

Me: uhh... It's illegal for hackers to do what they're doing. 

Her: tell them you'll find them... 

Me: ... well, we will find you... We can do that 

her: THAT'S RIGHT YOU BASTARDS HE'S GOING TO FIND YOU, AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO PRISON FOR A LONG TIME! HA!  TAKE THAT! 

Me: Alright, so what else can I help you with today? 

Her:  My TV isn't working, and my phone isn't working... I had to call in on my cellphone! 

&amp;#x200B;

I quickly check her modem status, and it is of course offline.  

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I notice your modem is unplugged... can you check for me and see if the power has come unplugged from it?  

Her: I unplugged it so they would quit hacking my computer!! 

Me: well, your modem is where your phone services come from as well.  If it's offline, then your phone services won't work.  It's also not possible for them to hack your phone line, because it's digitally encrypted, then sent from your modem directly to our system office, where it is directly connected to the person on the other side...

Her:  ... ... ... YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE BOXES THAT READ THE ROUND DOTS!!! 

Me: ... Ummm  

Her:  YOU'RE ONE OF THEM AREN'T YOU!! 

Me:  no, no, of course not.    
Her: I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN YOU MY PASSCODE! 

Me: as I said, you can go to the store tomorrow, and get that changed.  If you plug your modem back in, your phone services will begin working again.  If you leave your computer off, there's no way they can hack into it.  

Her: Oh, they're tired of seeing me at the store!  

&amp;#x200B;

It is at this point, she hangs up on me, and my manager calls me to his office to give me a call observation (in Jest) about how I could have improved my customer service in this situation, and provided a better resolution to the service...

"One day, I received a call from a client.  I work phone support for small to medium sized businesses with a few enterprise level ones in there.  We probably have like.... 70000 actual seats (computers with our support software on it).

&amp;#x200B;

Call comes in and the guy is unable to print some kind of PDF or document.  I don't remember exactly what type of document it was, only that it won't print.  So after gathering some info, I remoted into his computer to see the problem.  He couldn't print.  When he clicked the option to print the document it would freeze up and crash the program.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone's worked with printers before, you'd know this is sometimes indicative of the printer itself just having an aneurysm or going offline and is unreachable.  So naturally the first thing is to check the printer to ensure it's online and printing.  It was, everything else worked fine.  So I printed some other documents for a test on his machine and they worked.  At this point, I was convinced that there was a problem with this one specific document.  There was nothing outwardly wrong with it.  No weird texts, no pictures, no macros, no special formulas, no HTTP links, nothing that would be unassuming to the average user.

&amp;#x200B;

Now prior to me getting this issue, this has already been worked on by half a dozen other techs both from my company and the company we contract out from.  The company we contract to, we'll call them Tier 4, is the one we send the big stuff to such as server setups, physical onsites, purchases, etc.  The issue has been going on for TWO MONTHS and apparently no one has been able to figure out what's going on here.  The company who called was getting a little agitated about it.

To put it into perspective, I'm a Level 1 tech.  But in my company a Level 1 tech does far more than a traditional L1 tech on a helpdesk (which ususally just does passwords and other pleb tier work).  I don't like to brag about anything I do because I Feel it's inappropriate but I don't get paid enough for what I do based on what I actually know.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this issue has been through L2 techs (who are allowed to spend HOURS researching these problems, I can't), T4 techs and probably some other L1 techs.  So it's been through the gamut of experience and knowledge ranges.  Anyway, 2 months, no printing, got it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a habit of finding ultra-abstract ways to solve problems.  I'm talking, putting like 3 and 5 together to get 22.  Yeah, that statement makes no sense and neither does some of the things I do to solve issues.  So I open up another document, a blank one.  I take all of the data from the busted document and move it over to the new document.  Save it, try to print, failed.  Made a new document, moved the data in, didn't save it, printed, failed.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point the voice in my head is like ""all right, the problem is with the data in this document, it has to be.""  But then I ask myself, ""Okay, but there's nothing in the document that's out of the ordinary.  What gives?""  So I just start hacking half the data off.  I would basically just arbitrarily cut the data in half (if it's 4 pages, I'll take 2) and then copied that to a new document and print.  It worked.  Sweet, so now I smell blood.  This errant data wasn't about to hide from me.  So I zoned in on the half that was broke and kept narrowing it down.  I eventually got to one offending paragraph.  There was NOTHING wrong with it.  It was a paragraph.  So I'm thinking.... okay, wtf else could I do?  So the voice in my head is like ""Just flipping wing it and see what happens"".  All right, birdman time.  So I just started doing random stuff.  Changed the font, still gave the issue.  Changed font size, still the issue.  The only thing left to do was the color.

The font color.  Are you kidding me?  COLOR?!  Normally, I'd write it off.  But then I realized that sometimes things done to documents can freak printers out and they'll print gibberish, mess up the letter e on page 16 line 36 character 42, or outright crash and shut itself down.  I don't know how or why, but they do.  Anyway, I changed the color from the black that it was to 90% gray, which is pretty close.  Printed... and it worked.  It somehow worked.

&amp;#x200B;

I recompiled the whole document, printed, it failed.  Swapped the entire document's color, printed, and it worked.  Needless to say I got a praise from both companies and 2 recognition cards for it because evidently NO ONE could figure out what this problem was.

TL;DR - When dealing with a document that randomly doesn't print or operate properly, try taking the data and moving it to a new document.  If it does the same thing, the problem is with the data.  Keep cutting it in half until you find the bad section and just try WHATEVER comes to mind.  Even if it seems outlandishly ridiculous.

"I've mentioned this before, but I work for the fruit-based company as a T2 advisor. This was the last call of the week last week and came in about 20 minutes before my shift ended. This is a long one.


A customer calls in because his Hotmail account has been hacked (already a red flag, usually when they say they've been ""hacked"" it's all hooey) and his contacts have all gone missing from his devices. He had spoken to a colleague previously who had restored from a backup from before the contacts disappeared and everything was there again.


When he called, he wanted to get his contacts back on his other iPhone and his iPad. Should be a case of logging in to the accounts and have the info sync, right? Yeah, no.


During the process of the ""hacking"", the customer changed his Hotmail password. This meant that the device where his contacts had been restored to hadn't taken in the new password. When we logged in to his Hotmail on his other iPhone, no contacts were there. Then, he noticed his contacts had gone missing from the first iPhone. And here began the battle.


As soon as the first iPhone took in the new password, it saw that there were no contacts on the Hotmail account and deleted them again from the phone (iOS only asks if you want to merge when you enable iCloud contacts and doesn't merge others stored on 3rd-party accounts).


So, we had to erase the phone and restore the backup again and this time make sure we don't enter the new Hotmail password.


Since we don't have a way to move contacts between accounts and they are not locally stored on the phone either, I decided to use a 3rd-party app that saves all the contacts and stores them in a vCard file that is then emailed and can be opened or imported.


We do that (after having to pay 2,99 for the pro version) and send the email to himself.


Nothing. Minutes go by and the email is not sent, it's on the outbox.


We check on the Outlook app - Nothing on the outbox. We check on outlook.com on a desktop version - Nothing.
I try to do the backup and send again - Nothing. The customer, conveniently, doesn't have any other email address.


I try resending from the outbox on the Mail app and... ""Unable to send email, your mailbox is full.""


*headdesk*


I try deleting all drafts, junk and trash - Still not enough and the man had 23000+ unread emails, nevermind the read ones.


At this point, I was already 1h30 past the end of my shift and I gave up. I told him: ""Talk to Microsoft and ask for help to free up space or buy more space on Outlook. Call us as soon as you are able to receive that email with the vCard file.""


*end of act I*


Cue this morning. I hadn't thought about the man when a call comes in. I recognize the name.


""Oh no...""


The case number populates with my notes. It's him again.


*insert GTA meme here*


The man hadn't spoken to us over the weekend and didn't recognise my voice despite us having spoken for 2 straight hours 3 days prior. He still hasn't gotten rid of the clutter on his Hotmail but has now created a Gmail account.


I set up the screensharing on all 3 devices again, open the email that was still on the outbox and sent it to his Gmail. Sent and received, praise be.


Try to open the file directly on the iPad - Nothing. It says it's a vCard file but no options to import.


""I'm pretty sure iOS asks if you want to import contacts when you open a vCard"", I thought innocently.


We set up the Gmail on one of the iPhones and use the native Mail app to open the file - Same thing, no option to import.


I then decided to go to icloud.com on his iPad and import the vCard directly to the server.


We sign in, import the vCard and it imports... 49 contacts out of the hundreds he had.


*headdesk again*


More outside-the-box thinking led to instead import the vCard to Gmail, see what happens and if there's more contacts, export the vCard from there and then import to iCloud.


We go to gmail.com desktop version on the iPad, import the vCard... 600 contacts imported. icloud.com is such a POS of a platform.


Anyway, let's export the vCard. We select to export and then... Nothing. The vCard doesn't go anywhere. It's not saved and iOS doesn't ask where we want to save it. FFS.


The customer then noticed his contacts appearing on his iPhone because the Gmail account was syncing. At that point, I noticed his happiness and told him to connect the Gmail account on the remaining devices and have his contacts sync and just let it be like that. He agreed, and 45 more minutes later, we parted ways.


Tl;dr: Empty the crap out of your inbox every now and then.",Good old issue snowball.,0
"So as previously mentioned, we use $FinalPassword Enterprise extensively. By now, I class it as business critical - I couldn't do my job as a sysadmin without it. Most of our business applications use Google SSO, but for those that don't, $FP is invaluable for its random-generation and automatic save feature. We also use it to share passwords for things like Twitter accounts.

So, after doing a trial of $FP Enterprise in 2018 and being impressed enough to pay for it, I got an invite to a webinar ([I've mentioned this before](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8heeb8/thats_not_really_how_youre_supposed_to_use_a/)) where $FP people outlined the power of Policies. As any good admin knows, being able to enforce policies to everyone in the company is an extremely bulletproof way to avoid problems down the line.

One of the policies I really liked the sound of was the Shared Folders feature. Normally, under $FP (and I'm sure other platforms), users can share passwords directly with each other. This is all fine and dandy, but the critical problem is that the password resides within the original user's account. What happens when the user leaves and their account license is reused? One, two and ... ... poof! $Company forgot $Password!

So the policy exists to force users to share passwords in folders, by disabling direct sharing. By doing so, the password moves from an individual account to the shared folder and is not directly tied to an account. There's also a policy that every shared folder is implicitly shared with an admin. So I happily switched both features on. I keep all my shared passwords in folders (things like CCTV cameras, web UIs for internal devices, those sorts of things) and I thus have granular access control. Everybody wins!

Except...

So last week I get a message from a colleague via our CTO:

&gt;$Colleague: err, did we delete $ExColleague's $FP or something recently? I no longer have the passphrase for the release scripts in my vault

Interesting. I sit with $Colleague to go through what he's trying to find. Sure enough, there's no trace of the password where he expects it. Nor is there any trace at all that I can see as an admin.

$ExColleague left in March. I check through the logs and I deleted his $FP account in April, all routine. $ExColleague also set up the release process $Colleague is trying to use. But if he shared it through $FP, he would have been forced to create the password in a shared folder, so there's no way it would get lost, right?

Right?

Every so often, when I'm in the admin console, I poke into the Shared Folders tab, which shows me what folders are being shared and how many passwords are in them. Mine are all there and have several password entries, as expected. There's a few other shared folders, but some of them are empty. At the time, I never thought much of it - most of what we do is SSO'd after all, so the need to share passwords is quite small. This time I take a more critical eye to it, and then delve into the Policies.

&gt;Policy                                                                          Value  
&gt;  
&gt;Prohibit Sharing Except for Shared Folders    Disabled

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;$me: Oh you have got to be KIDDING ME.

So then things begin to fit into place. I dig into $FP's excellent auditing logs:

Ohhhhh !""£$%\^\*().

When an account is closed, $FP has an annoying habit of deleting all references to the name from the logs and thereafter only referring to it by user ID - so the person who changed the setting has left. Unfortunately there is no easy way to figure out someone's user ID. So I can only go by an assumption - someone who has left, and had admin access to $FP. The only one who fits the bill left last month. They had admin access because they were the person with the credit card.

So here we are. Nothing we can do, the account has long been purged, we've lost contact with $ExColleague and the password is protecting a GPG signing key. So we'll have to generate a new one and go through the same validation hoops. The last time we released something was in January, hence why we didn't notice until now.

I've switched the policy back on but it's not retroactive, so I have unknown shared passwords that can go bye-bye when a user leaves. I just spot-checked and $CTO himself is sharing 20 individual passwords without folders. I now have to check and guide many people through this.

Best part is that I have no clue why $OldAdmin decided to switch the setting off. They never mentioned it, and the only indication was in the audit logs. I never get more annoyed than when I pre-empt something, do something about it and it happens anyway.

"One of my biggest clients has two offices: a home office about 10 miles away and a remote office 175 miles away. 

The home office is run like any ""proper"" business of its size: Ubiquiti networking gear, a Windows domain, multiple backups to external hard drives and the cloud, Dell 3060 Micros for the users, Office 365 Business Premium, etc. And I have these users trained pretty well: they're good about rebooting their computers first, about calling me before opening sketchy emails, about writing down (or screencapping) error messages. Pretty much the best you could hope for from non-technical folks.

The remote office, on the other hand, is treated like the red-headed stepchild. They used to get the home office's hand-me-down PCs (when I took over IT in 2004 one user was still using a Pentium 266! No, that's not a joke). They don't have a server 'cos they don't need one. They're using an Archer C9 router 'cos it was cheap and ""good enough"". And since the only user-specific app on their PCs is Outlook, I have them logging in as COMPANYUSER with the same password. The ""same password"" thing was an explicit request of the owner, but the same user was my idea - if someone leaves the company, all I have to do is uninstall Office 365 and OneDrive, disconnect the old O365 account from Windows and reinstall Office 365 and OneDrive for the new employee. It's not perfect by any means, but since the office is a three hour drive (and there's no real reason for them to have individual profiles) it works.

Or, at least, it did. A user left recently, so I removed her Office\OneDrive install and reinstalled it for the new user. It seemed to work fine on my end. Until Thursday, when I got a text from the office manager up there. She said the new user ""couldn't save any files"" and it ""looked like the computer has been wiped!"" She said that she ""needed this fixed ASAP!""

One problem with that office is that its understaffed. More than once its taken a whole day to do a fix an issue that ideally should only take 20-30 minutes... because users will get a customer or phone call, and it'll take them 45 minutes to get back to their computers. Then they'll go to lunch, even if I ask them to wait, 'cos it'll only take a few more minutes if they'll stick around for a couple minutes. So, despite asking for help ""ASAP"", it took 35 minutes to finally get in touch with the office manager.     

I accessed the computer remotely and found Adobe Reader wouldn't save a file because it was locked up. So I ended the task, and noticed the OneDrive wasn't running... in fact, it looked like it had been uninstalled. So I installed it for the new user and set up file protection, because if anyone needs it, it's this office. After that, I asked the office manager (OM) to show me what was wrong.

&gt;OM: ""Well, look at this!"" 

[she opens the Documents folder, which is empty except for the default folders and some RDP files they use to connect to the home office] 

&gt;OM: ""There's NOTHING here! It's like it was wiped! There should be HUNDREDS of documents here! This office DEPENDS on these documents! We are literally DEAD IN THE WATER without them!""

&gt;Me: ""Well, [old user] didn't use the Documents folder. She kept everything on the desktop. Here, look..""

[There are only, like, four folders on the desktop; I open one to reveal *hundreds* of documents and templates; I then open another folder to show OM hundreds *more* documents and templates]

&gt;OM: ""Well, OK. That's a relief! But the computer still won't let us save files!""

[I open Excel, type some gibberish and save the file to the desktop. It works. I open an existing Word doc, type ""THIS IS A TEST"" at the top and save it as EDIT-[FILENAME.DOCX]. That works, too.]

&gt;OM: ""No, not Office! Reader!""

&gt;Me (annoyed at her ""not Office, you idiot!"" tone): ""Why don't you show me the problem.""

She opened Reader, and I watched as a box popped-up that said something like ""We recovered one of your documents from a program crash. Do you want to restore it?"" Before I could even finish reading the textbox, OM clicked NO. She then clicked through the recent items and File &gt; Open dialog. 

&gt;OM: ""See? I spent HOURS working on this PDF with [new user] and now it's GONE. I can't find it ANYWHERE! WHERE IS IT???""

&gt;Me, dumbfounded: ""Why in the world did you click 'No' on that box that popped up when you opened Reader?""

&gt;OM: ""Oh, I never read those things!""

&gt;Me: ""Well, I couldn't read the whole thing since you clicked ""No"" so quickly, but it said that it recovered a document from a crash, and asked if you wanted to restore it. That was almost certainly the document you spent HOURS working on.. and it saved a copy for you.. and you clicked 'No, I don't want that file.' So now it's gone.""

&gt;OM: ""Like... *gone* gone?""

"I just remembered this special interaction I've had. It has become my number one tale to scare my users into backing up their files and I thought I'll share it with you. Excuse any grammar errors, english is not my first langauge.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a couple of years ago, I was fresh out of my apprenticeship in my first real job at a big university in Central Europe. My team consisted of 6 people, every one of us has a couple of faculties to support. We also have a help desk, that routes calls from those faculties to the right supporter and that answer the general problems from students.

&amp;#x200B;

At that time, my faculty was the law faculty. Now, law professors are a special breed, on par with doctors in their God complex. But everyone knows the secretaries are the people that actually run this joint and even the profs are scared of angering them.

To make my life easier I made a point to befriend them. This was made easier by the fact that I am their first female supporter and they were so fascinated by this, that they regularly invited me for their daily coffee and cake breaks.

That also meant they sometimes ask me for things that I'm strictly speaking not allowed to provide.

&amp;#x200B;

Enough of backstory, let's get to the story

$me = obviously

$HD = student that works in help desk and routes/screens calls

$favSec = my favorite secretary, was a sweetheart but not very computer savvy. Had to explain her a lot of things again and again, but she reigned in her professor for me, so I didn't mind

$PhD = student working for $favSec and simultaneously working on her dissertation. Not computer savvy either. Manages to hard shutdown her computer during updates EVERY SINGLE TIME.

&amp;#x200B;

It's 1pm, I'm watching the clock tick by and contemplate what I did wrong in my life to end up in the public sector with a boring job that every monkey can do in an infrastructure that is stuck in the 80s.

&amp;#x200B;

The phone rings, a frantic $HD is on the other end

&gt;\&gt; $HD: ""Oh good, you're in. I have $favSec on the phone for you, but she doesn't want to tell me what's the problem. And there is someone crying in the background.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""OK, just give me the call, I'll see what they have done now."" - ""Hello $favSec, this is $Me, what can I do for you today?""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; $favSec: ""Oh thank God, you're in today. I know you're not allowed support private usb sticks, but this is really REALLY important. $PhD can't see her usb stick on the PC anymore.""

The crying in the background get's louder. Please, tell me it's not what I think it is...

I normally would tell them to drop of the usb stick and I'll get to it in the next couple days. But it's a slow day and I think we all know where this story is going.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; $Me: ""Well, I won't garantuee anything, but I'll come and take a look at it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; $favSec to $PhD: ""Dont worry, $Me is coming and will get it working again.""  
&gt;  
&gt;(Thanks lady, nothing like a little pressure to save the day)

&amp;#x200B;

I inform my boss of the impending fiasco and make my way to the law faculty building. As I enter their floor, I see secretaries like meerkats popping out of their door and just as fast disappearing again. That seems slightly ominous.

I get to the office of $PhD and see $favSec wringing her hands and another student worker consoling a crying $PhD.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""so, what's the problem exactly?""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$PhD: ""I came in this morning, put in the usb stick and I can't see it! It has my dissertation on it!!! I have to submit it next week!!!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Motherf\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I take a look at it and sure enough, nothing in explorer but I can see an unidentified mass storage device in device manager.

But surely this is not the only copy of her dissertation. She probably lost like a couple hours if work, but not her whole dissertation. SURELY! Because who would work on a dissertation for a couple of years ond only save it on one usb stick?!

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this idiot did. She worked on it on her private laptop at home, but never saved a copy there. For years she was working on the same document, reading and writing on this usb stick.

She never saved in on another usb, never saved in on a pc directly, never mailed it to herself (*I spend 5 minutes explain to her that mailing it to herself would be a fast and easy way to save it. She did not understand this, to her this would not work and she was stupified I suggested this*), never used a private cloud storage, never used the faculty file share, never used the university's own cloud storage.

&amp;#x200B;

While I was getting all this information from her, I tried everything to access the USB stick, no dice.

&amp;#x200B;

Even $favSec cringed at some of the answers from $PhD. During this $PhD kept getting more and more distressed.

One last try, maybe she just didn't understand my questions for a backup.

&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""so you never saved a copy of this file anywhere else, ever?""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$PhD: ""no, why should I?! I never needed to, this usb stick was working perfectly for the last 8 years.""

&amp;#x200B;

Well, yes, it did. Now it doesn't anymore. It was one of the first intenso rainbow usb sticks. Honestly, I was amazed it held for so long, it just reached its EOL with all her writing in this file for years.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""Have you saved it in ANY other way?""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; *Now, in my language 'saved' can also be interpreted as 'protected'.*  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;*$PhD stops crying and her eyes light up.*  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; *Hallelujah, we are saved.*

&amp;#x200B;

It was all just a misunderstanding. Of course this 20-something student knows better and backed it up somewhere.

She hold up [this freaking leather pouch](https://www.google.com/search?q=usb+leather+pouch&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_deDE844DE844&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi48bjW9cXjAhVHxaYKHR2ZBAcQ_AUIEigC&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=578&amp;dpr=1.5#imgrc=AEFNsFvVmveN0M:)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;$PhD: ""Oh yes! I always protected it with this. Everytime I unplugged the usb, I put in in this. Does this help?“  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""No, unfortunately this does not help…at all…“

&amp;#x200B;

This is when the wailing starts. I'm sitting there, wondering how this is my life. The other student worker proceeds to half drag $PhD out of the office into another one, while $favSec looks at me with wide eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""I want to make clear, that this is nothing my department could have prevented as she is responsible for her dissertation and we don't support this. We also don't support data recovery as you know. Everything important should be either on file share or on the university cloud.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$favSec: ""Understood, $Me, I make sure nothing falls back in you. Just please see if you can save anything.... I'll go and make a new pot of coffee. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Bless you, $favSec.

It was the truth when I told her we don't recover data. We have backup team for the fileshare and cloud, but desk side support has no tools for data recovery. And everyone knows this. It actually means 99% is saved correctly and the other 1% is on their own. But the crying.... So I consult my boss and my coworkers and try every freeware we can think off. After about 3 hours I actually have a couple of old file version recovered.

Bad news: they are around 5 months old.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after 3 hours and around 3 pots of coffee, $PhD has become slightly manic with a Coffein fueled glimmer in her eyes. I show her the files I recovered, send them to her mail and save them on her work pc and advise her to either buy the full version of the freeware or give it to a data recovery specialist.

&gt;\&gt; $ME: ""Honestly, go with the data recovery. It will cost you, but the probably can save all of it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$PhD: ""no no, I can do it. No problem. I will just rewrite 5 months of work until my submit date next week. No worries.""  
&gt;  
&gt;*She keeps mumbling while walking to her pc.*

I'm slightly unsettled and just want to get out of her office ASAP.

$favSec gave me some muffins as a payment.

&amp;#x200B;

I get back to my office and find my coworkers on a smoke break. I still can't believe what just happened and tell them about the leather pouch. They were all equally mystified as I was, about how stupid users can be.

&amp;#x200B;

But as I said, it has become a good story to scare users into saving and a great icebreaker when meeting new IT people.

And as far as I know $PhD managed to get an extension on her submit date.

"So I've got a good one for you all! About 5 months ago I had just started at my current job, Technical support for Point of Sale systems. This also happens to be my first IT related position. This happened about 3 weeks into the job, so I'm fresh meat with a whole lot to learn yet. For the sake of the story let's call this restaurant Bob's Restaurant and the User Kevin.


Call from one of our partner dealer sites, Caller ID says 'Bob's Restaurant'

Answers phone: ""POS Support, How can I help you today?""

User:"" Hi, this is 'Kevin' from Bob's restaurant, I'm trying to delete an account in the back""

Me:""Ok give me one moment to get logged in and assist you.""

We use a remote connection program on all of our sites, the back computer acts as a server for all the POS Stations.
Gets logged in

Me:""Alright sir, could you show me which account you're trying to delete?""

User:""Yes it's this account here."" User hovers mouse over an account with more than 3000$ USD of balance. It's important to note that accounts act as tabs, customers can come in and put items on their accounts, and then come in at a later date and make payments on their accounts to reduce the balance owed. So for this account to have a 3000$ balance means that that account owes 3000.

Me:""Ok Kevin, give me a moment here.""

Me to my supervisor:"" Hey this guy wants to delete an account with 3k on it? No way we are allowed to do that correct?""

Supervisor:""Nah, not without a whole lot of security questions  and documentation to cover ourselves in case of an audit.""

Me to User""You said you name was Kevin? Could I please get your last name and position at the restaurant? ""

User:"" My name is Kevin *******, I am a General Manager.""

Me:""Ok Kevin, what is the reason for deleting this account?""

User:""What's with all these security questions? I shouldn't be getting interrogated. I have a request and it's your job to do it.""


At this point I knew some fishy stuff was going on.

Me:""I apologize Kevin, but I am going to have to discuss further actions with my supervisor as I cannot authorize the deletion of an account.""

It's company policy to not do any actions that could compromise a restaurants profits or cause legal repercussions. This is a huge red flag.

ME to Supervisor:"" So the guys says he's the GM, but this seems a little off to me, he got real defensive when I asked him some questions.""

Supervisor:""Ok let me take a look at what we've got.""

Looks over my notes, we discuss the possibility of fraud. As we are discussing it I hear over my headset: ""F**k this, I can do it myself."" Kevin immediately selects the account and hits delete, hits the confirmation. And boom just like that a owing balance of 3k gone. He immediately hung up afterwards. My supervisor told me to log everything, and be as detailed as possible including time stamps and include the call log. This was forwarded to my boss and later to the restaurant owner who confirmed with us that that account was held by Kevin's close friend. I am not aware of what happened to Kevin but I have my assumptions.

That was my first taste of how awful people are at times. He cost that restaurant 3k. Moral of the story: note down everything no matter how insignificant you think it is, it may very well protect you in the future.",I Watched a User Commit Fraud,0
"Relatively new Reddit lurker, first post. Recently discovered this sub, and thought you might get a quick laugh out of this. I swear this riveting tale is a true story, hand on heart. No TL;DR, read it or not.

So, I work in tech support, and have been for a year and a half, we deal with issues with software on personal phones and computers. This happened straight out of training, just about a month in, when the guides (other employees listening and helping our calls in the beginning) had let go of the reins, and we were taking calls on our own. Still a bit new to procedures, but for the most part, things are going well.

I have a few other friends in tech-support (not the same firm), who sometimes tell me about idiotic or rude callers, fun stories which I sometimes dismiss in my mind, because a few of them sounded exaggerated and embellished. Even after landing this job, I still held on to those beliefs for a while.

""For a while"" lasted until I got this particular caller on the line. This caller is polite, generally likeable, follows exact instructions (important), and just wants her issue resolved. Nothing wrong with that, right? She calls, because in the past week, her phone has been unable to connect or receive calls, no error messages. She is calling from her office phone, making troubleshooting a bit easier.

So, I go through a bit of basic troubleshooting with her.

You know, stuff like ""Is airplane mode turned on?"" (No), ""Does carrier data display websites?"" (Yes), that stuff. We're about halfway down the list of to do things prior to getting her to contact her carrier/Tier 2, when we reach a step I assumed would go by in a jiffy.

No chance.

The step was to simply remove the SIM card, to see if it was okay, and if the gold-plating had fingerprints or anything on it which should not be there. Unlikely, but we do need to check it anyway, and told the caller as much, she complies.

She has one of those phones with the SIM card tray. One opens the slot, pulls out the tray and inserts/removes SIM, reverse process to put it back. Even if you've never seen this exact SIM insertion system in your life, the process is self-explanatory if you've ever owned a cellphone, and this caller had had her phone for a while. It cannot get complicated, it is the simplest thing in the world.

Or so I thought.

She opens the slot, pulls out the tray, removes the SIM. She takes a good hard look at it, cleaning it with a dry cloth for good measure. So far, so good. 

Then I tell her: ""Alright, now please put the SIM back in the phone, and we'll see if anything changes.""

She replies: ""Ok.""

There's a five-second break in the conversation, and just as I am about to ask if she has reinserted her SIM, she asks me this: ""...By the way, should the SIM card be *in* the tray when I put it back in?""

A bit hesitantly, I reply: ""...Yes.""

She replies, without skipping a beat: ""Oh, because I put in the SIM without using the tray, the tray is still on my desk.""

Now it is my turn to have a five-second break in the conversation, as my brain struggles to process and comprehend this new piece of data it has just received, and how ANYONE could actually do that. 

Of course, I don't tell her that, the next words out my mouth is: ""Can you get it out?""

She can not get it out. 

She struggles a bit with the phone, but the SIM is firmly lodged in there, and the callers attempt to pry it out with pointy items and tweezers only pushes it further in, and the SIM gets more and more stuck. Luckily, she did not take her ire out on me, still as polite as ever, never even cursing. Similarly, I kept cool and professional, despite the overwhelming urge to slam my head on my desk.

I know we cannot continue the troubleshooting until we get the SIM out of the phone and back in the way it is supposed to be, as it is rather necessary in order to troubleshoot the whole ""calls will not connect"" issue. I tell the caller as much, and she is understanding of the conundrum.

In the end, we agree that I would provide her with a case number so that she can call us back later, when she has managed to dislodge the SIM. She agrees, and tells me she'll get the phone to an electronic store, and see if they can help her with it, and we agree she should call back later, no hard feelings.

The last thing I hear before the line drops, is:

**\*THUD\* \*THUD\* \*THUD\***

And I realize she is slamming her phone on the desk, not her office phone, but the one she has been calling about, in an attempt to dislodge the SIM the only way she could think of, brute force. (Pro-tip, fancy smart-phones does not deal well with being repeatedly slammed against a desk.)

Never did learn what the end result of the case was, but I did learn to properly use baby-steps with other callers going forward, and got my very own ""inept caller"" story to share with friends.",*THUD* *THUD* *THUD*,0
"As always, I work Enterprise fiber. 

I had a call, VERY recently, where a lady was complaining about excessive noise with the equipment in her equipment closet. The way she was describing it, I thought that the voice gateway (VGW) was burning out or overheating and about to go into a critical failure. I log into the Cisco and, as I'm logging in, she says, ""Yes, the fan is a little louder than normal. I think it needs to be checked by a technician.""

I type ""show environment"" and everything is normal. I check the logs for alarms on the VGW and the layer 2 switch the VGW is connected to and there isn't a single issue with anything. I tell her, ""Ma'am, I'm not finding anything out of the ordinary. The fan may get a little louder if the temperature in the room is a bit higher than normal.""

She says, ""Well, the increased noise is disruptive to our work environment. We can't work with this noise. Can't you hear it in the background? I'm standing next to it."" I can here dozens of fans going off but, most importantly, I can hear other people on phone calls in the background. 

""Ma'am, it's not unusual for a fan to get louder if an area is hotter."" She says, ""Well, I think a technician needs to look at this because this noise is louder than usual and it should not get any louder."" I'm INSTANTLY irritated by this as she's demanding a technician for this issue. I tell her that I'm setting up the dispatch as she asked. 

I submit the ticket to the tech and he doesn't respond (I already know why). I reach out to dispatch to make sure they are aware. Dispatch looks at the ticket and I say, ""Yes, you read it right: no alarms, no abnormalities, no historical or current logs for issues."" They let the tech know and he doesn't respond. I tell dispatch to just let him get there whenever. 

He contacts me and is like, ""Are they serious?""

"I've got two quick stories from my current position as a technician for a small ISP. This time, dealing with some of our customers' IT people and their understanding of electricity. One of these stories is a few months old. The other from just this morning. Both of these customer are among our largest, each with employee counts in the hundreds.

**Story 1**

A while back, we got a call from one of our major customers. They had experienced a power outage, but their backup power had come online and their internet was still down. Of course, the first thing I check is our monitoring system to see the status and history of their ONT. This ONT showed a warning that it was on battery power. In this state, the ONT will disable all services other than phones, in case emergency calls need to be made while the power is out and to keep the ONT online as long as possible. I asked the tech that had called us to check on the ONT and confirm that it's actually connected to power. The tech hangs up to go do so.

&amp;#x200B;

About 20 minutes later, I get a call on my direct line from the same tech. Not only did the ONT have no power, but the entire networking room lacked power. They had forgotten to connect the circuit that room was on to their backup power grid when it was put in.

They had experienced a power outage earlier in the morning, but now that the power was back on, they still had no internet service and were wondering why this was the case. The tech stated that it was important that they get internet online again soon in order to continue their work. Our monitoring system said that their ONT was online and that it had gone down around the time of the power outage. Story checks out. However, the port that their firewall is connected to showed no DHCP leases (static IPs are also shown in this section of our interface), indicating that it was either not powered or had failed to grab an IP after booting, as it may have booted faster than our ONT did after the power returned.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing I suggest to the tech to try is to reseat the ethernet cable in the firewall or to reboot the firewall to try to convince it to grab it's assigned static IP address, but, of course, he's offsite and is 20 minutes away. He'll go onsite and try that right away!

&amp;#x200B;

50 minutes later, he calls back and says everything is working again. I thought you said it was urgent, bud!",Third Party IT and the Concept of Electricity,0
"TL;DR: Lady destroys her printer due to an almost-correct troubleshooting run.

&amp;#x200B;

One day my girlfriend met a very kind elderly woman in a Cafe. Let's name this woman Lost Lady since she is the only person I know that is both a great scientist and completely lost if the subject isn't pure theoretical science from her field.  Up to the point that she treats Nigeria spam serious, doesn't fall victim to it (as she isn't greedy) but instead finds a person who is happy that someone is willing to listen about the problems of life in Nigeria. She even tried to run a campaign to get one of the candidates for the elections for the Major of the town in order to change things in Nigeria.

Turns out she is in need of a printer. And that she is big friends with Great Professor. Both big Red Flags as this professor asked me to repair an Cockroach-infected printer from a friend. As a popular supermarket happens to sell an all-in-one inkjet with low power consumption (and therefore low appeal for cockroaches, lest they still exist in her flat) and Lost Girl has no car my girlfriend asks me if I help transporting the thing and to install the drivers.

&amp;#x200B;

The woman has DSL (which isn't bad). A Router the TelCo has delivered with the password being identical to the network name and a Windows XP Computer that is slow, because constantly swapping =&gt; If the printer will work, then by pure chance. Luckily I have brought my Netbook (which was my only Computer at that time) so I can prepare all the downloads needed on an USB stick. Whilst I am installing the two women discuss about a letter Lost Lady got that states she has won ONE MILLION DOLLARS: Lost Lady wants to call the (very long foreign) number on the envelope as even as she doesn't remember to have played in the lottery: What if she still has won? And that she cannot just throw away the letter. What would the other people living in her house think (?). All the time I fight with my Netbook's Touchpad bug: The thing works fine unless you fail to touch it for more than a minute. In this case it increases the sensitivity to a point that it seems to spot movements more than a centimeter away and invents random clicks. Most tools that suppress taps while typing seem to tell the touchpad to disable taps. Which this specific touchpad ignores. But in the end the printer works and we go home.

Several calls follow, months apart, about adjusting the print-heads after changing the ink. Then in a really busy time for me she calls me and tells that there is a paper jam she cannot resolve. Two weeks later I am finally  in our town again, turn on the printer and instead of the complex print head and paper feed handling sound it just gives a uniform hum. I open the device and the print head is missing. Lost lady says that she had found out that this was the part of the printer that always hit the jammed paper so she hat taken it out. And thrown it away.",The Printer II,0
"Quick back story, Fairly important User calls and is having an issue printing from one specific program. She can print just fine otherwise. I tell her that I do not have access to fix the issue that she is having and give her the phone number for the software team that can. (Our line is more for hardware and general windows issues, any issues with in house programs we use have to go through another group)

She calls back 20 minutes later saying that no one is answering the phone when she calls claiming that I must have given her the wrong number. I confirm with her the phone number I gave her was the right one. (had her repeat back the number I gave her to make sure she has the right one and it was). They just werent asnwering the phones. She calls them again and same thing. She calls back and asks why I cant just fix her issue. And I explain again that I am unable to fix her issue as I do not have the access nor the training required on how to fix the program. She needs to go through the people that administrate the program to fix the issue.

Fast forwards to the 5th time she calls I am starting to get a bit annoyed at the situation. Its apparently my fault that they arent picking up their phones and that I need to fix her issue right now. 

Now I would like to think I have good patience when it comes to problem users. I try to put myself in their shoes and understand that they dont know all the technical details that we know. But when I encounter a user that just will not accept the fact that I am unable to solve their issue needless to say I get a little upset. At this point I am running out of nice ways to say I have no way to fix this issue, please contact the support number I gave you. If they arent picking up there really isnt anything that I can do. If they arent picking up for you, then they certainly wont be picking up for me. I dont know why they arent answering their phones its a completely separate department that we have very little to do with each other outside of making sure users can open up the software teams programs.",A user reported me today for being rude.,0
"I feel like the title serves as a pretty good tl;dr for the situation, but essentially, our corporate mobile software forces the user to enroll an MDM profile on their phone. It comes with some minor security requirements, the most major one being that it requires a 6-digit PIN for your phone's unlock screen, if you currently have a 4-digit one. 

Well, this user was really upset about this. She says it's ridiculous that she has to change her password, despite our company being hit with a major breach a few months ago. She doesn't care, this is about her convenience, not about the sensitive corporate data that's housed on her phone. 

Anyway, she finally manages to change her lock screen PIN, and I shit you not, literally forgets it seconds later. Her having the memory of a goldfish and being completely unable to adapt to any sort of change in her work environment is now our fault, and she goes to complain to cybersecurity about how I, the lowly level 2 support agent, made her change her lock screen, and not, you know, the management software that she was free to opt out of at any time. 

I don't usually have any issues with my users.

"This is one that 2 years and 2 jobs later still irks me to no end. Back when I was working for the MSP I mentioned, the staff was myself &amp; a co-worker (!CO), as well as the owner and 1 or 2 on-call contractors we would escalate tickets to and the owner (!OWN), so !CO &amp; I were basically Tier 1 &amp; 2. I'd been there a few months at this point and had helped this company ($C) in question a number of times.

&amp;#x200B;

One day one of their employees ($E) call and calls for an issue with her Outlook display font changing to a different, smaller one, which didn't look good on her screen. I fix it up, she tests it out &amp; is on her way. A few days later, $E calls back with the same issue. Fixed it and she was good. It seemed like every 2-3 days for 3 weeks $E was calling in about this. Every time she called, you can sense she was getting more &amp; more frustrated that it wasn't getting fixed &amp; I agreed with her. Kept searching ticket history, knowledge articles, Google, nothing would give a long-term fix. !CO was normally at other client's site when these calls came in and after the 5th or so call, I finally got a chance to explain everything to him to pick his brain, but he was as perplexed as me.

&amp;#x200B;

She calls again and luckily she gets !CO this time. He tries everything he can think of and anything not posted in my past tickets, but sure enough she calls in a few days later as it returned. One day !CO is actually over at the $C site and checks on her computer too see if the settings we're seeing on the remote tool are different then what she is seeing, but it's the same.

&amp;#x200B;

$E finally stops calling after nearly a month, so I'm not sure if she just gave up or what. A few weeks later, !OWN stops in after visiting them. He tells me that the client has requested that I no longer work on their account since $E complained that I wasn't getting her issue fixed and said I was a joke of a technician. !CO was right there when !OWN was explaining this and stood-up for me saying if he reviewed the ticket history for $E, he would see that it's not because of lack of effort and both of us worked on her case, not just me. Didn't matter to !OWN, if $C said jump, he would say how high &amp; I was to never work on their account again during the rest of my time there.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was having my exit interview, !OWN asked if there was anything he could do to make the company better. I told him that he needs to stand-up for his employees more and not just cave in if a client says something. I also told him was, when they said I was a joke, he should've said ""Don't talk about my employees like that because your insulting me as much as you are them. Let me look into the case in question &amp; I'll get back to you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to !CO a few months after I left and he said that !OWN never changed, not that I expected it. Moral of the story, have your employees backs and they'll go the extra mile for you, not bail as quickly as they can.

"Hiya TFTS, its been a while since my last post. Long story short there is my last hell desk fired me (laughed all the way to unemployment that went on too long) and have since been at such greener pastures I honestly haven't had a story worth sharing (seriously, any 'bad' user apologizes shortly after and/or brings treats)

This story is like 25% $user and 75% coworker ($CW) headache. And I'll be $Me, as if you needed that explained.

To set the table we're a large company with a sprawling multi-building campus in a downtown area. Due to cost of that the majority of IT was moved to a satellite office a few years ago with a small desk kept in the main building downtown for in person issues. When I say small think the repair desk at your average small cell phone store staffed by the Executive Support tech and a tech rotating from the satellite office every couple months. I'm that rotating tech at present, and I'm the primary support for the 2k+ people on this campus as most don't bother with the help desk line even when trivial.

In this case $User came by to schedule a time to upgrade their computer to Windows 10. Its gonna be needed soon anyways so I'm glad to help, and $User even planned it for a day they're on PTO! That kinda forethought would deserve a prize normally, until they get into the specifics. 

Its a desktop that even they don't know why they need it over a laptop.

They also want a bevy of applications installed that generally can't be done without being on their profile, or we don't have (like a 6 generation old version of Firefox that they still think is needed for a webapp that we've repeatedly proven isn't) So I explain this to her as clearly as I can. Its clear its not understood, but I do my best to get it noted that it was explained and move on with my life.

A few days later $User drops off the computer. I notice it booting up slow so I open it up and find they're still rocking a 3.5"" platter drive. So I sigh and back it up, then swap them for an extra SSD for my own sanity in copying the data. I image it to Windows 10 and the company policy, set the user with the needed permissions, copy over their backup, and even give them current Firefox out of the goodness of my heart, or to at very least limit the complaints later.

$User's colleague picks it up since they were out. I tell them again about the software and that the backup was copied but $User needs to login and call the Help Desk to merge it with the profile once her profile downloads from the server. And all is right with the world...or so I thought.

A couple days later $User comes back by.

&gt;$User: Hey me! So I called the help desk and they asked me who upgraded it to Windows 10. Also, I didn't see our old Firefox on there and they couldn't find my email archives

&gt;$Me: *Eye twitches a bit* They asked who at the downtown office upgraded the computer? The Help Desk knows we're the only technichians here...but let's get back to that. I told you about the Firefox, we don't have that version on file and it shouldn't be needed. As for the Archives, they should all be there. Please call the Help Desk again and if they have any issue with finding them please let them know that the Tech Desk did the reimage and ask us if they have an issue.

&gt;$User: *Eyes glassed over a bit* Oh, umm, ok. I can do that. And you said tell them the tech place?

&gt;$Me: The Tech Desk downtown, at the Main building. They'll know it.

&gt;$User: Ok...sure, thanks!

And with that $User walked off, and I again thought all was right. And it was. For another 2 days at least. Then I get a message from $CW

&gt;$CW: Hey $Me!, Do you know $User?

&gt;$Me: Hi $CW, yeah I do. I reimaged her computer a couple days ago. Even upgraded the drive.

&gt;$CW: Great! Because I can't find her archives anywhere! Do you still have her backup?

&gt;$Me: I still have her backup, and her original 3.5"" drive with pretty much all of her data possible on it. But I'm sure I moved over the archive. Have you checked all the backup and AppData?

&gt;$CW: I have, I swear. I just want to be able to close this ticket. Can you check the backup?

&gt;$Me: *Sigh*

So I go and grab the backup drive and plug it into my computer. As I do so I remote into the computer with /C$/ to move the data. As I do I see the archives are clearly in the Outlook Files folder in the backup. I also see on the user's drives that $CW hadn't deleted the ""$User.backup"" profile I copied over. I take a look inside and there are all the backups

&gt;$Me: *Facepalm so hard that the Exec Support guy looks up concerned* Hey $CW, its definitely on the backup drive, but its also on the computer. In the Outlook Files from the ""$User.backup"". Looks like you didn't ensure the whole thing copied over.

&gt;$CW: Oh, wow! That's great! I didn't think to check the backup on the computer 

&gt;$Me: You don't say? *Further plans for the happy hour when this day is done* Glad to help $CW

"I'm not technically tech support, but I handle all support calls regarding the company ERP system.  Usually forwarded from actual tech support, but some VIPs tend to approach me directly.

Yesterday, on my lunch break, my personal cell phone rings.  It's the Director of Production.  I don't answer, because I don't get paid enough for that. He leaves a voice mail.  For context, his office has just been moved from one building to another, and since most desktops are slated to be replaced this year IT replaced his as part of the move.

"Hi TFTS! I posted quite a while ago but this one I feel is worthy for your reading pleasure. (Hence the Unsolvable Problem name - big payoff at the end!)


Background: So I am a technician that works for a company that specializes in electricity. We primarily design and manufacture Earth fault protection equipment for the mining industry, municipalities, rail, medical etc. The market at the moment is struggling and my company is also struggling so I thought instead of having our CTO do the IT stuff (which takes a lot of time due to his real work load) I would help him with it. Now I am the electrical technician as well as the IT guy.


We always bought Dell laptops for the after sales service they give. With new office employees and the low funds, our previous (not with us anymore) IT guy bought Asus Laptops. These laptops HDD's tended to fail after 2 years and slowly but surely I would just buy and swap them out with 250GB SSD's when the inevitable occurred. To date, 4 out of the 5 Asus laptops HDD's have failed within 2 years. I know it's not Asus themselves, rather the cheap HDD's they put in these laptops. These laptops are office laptops and stay in office, so little to no abuse on them.


Queue our MD's PA who has a Asus. I already swapped her to a SSD. She complains her PC screen randomly shuts down and she has to press a button to get it back again. This goes on for a while and its extremely difficult to recreate. I check all the power settings as well and later outright disable all power saving features. The issue is still ongoing but I try every tip and trick Google and I can think of. Shortly after we finally move to a Domain and I have to redo all user profiles for application to the Domain. I tell her I could format the entire PC and start fresh and also put her on the Domain, then just add her files again from backup (I explain to her this effectively eliminates the software side of things , thereafter we can start looking at hardware). She says great she is off for a week in future and I agree to redo the machine. I wanted to do it this way just to make sure the laptop had no weird windows settings on that was screwing with her. She also had a Win10 Home install and not an Enterprise Win10 so it was perfect time for me to start from the beginning and do everything my way and not the previous IT guy's way (which had no way).


I format and install and for a week this laptop does not recreate the screen switching off bug. Next week goes by and I give it back. Over the course of the week the laptop screen dies even more. I am setting up external screens but still. It gets to a point where the MD is up in arms and asking me what is the solution? At this point I am so frustrated with the laptop (and the HDD's failing) that I just want to buy her a new one and send this laptop to a repairs place. He says go ahead but get it fixed she needs to work. I decide to take one final look at the laptop.


I tell her to start working while I sit next to her and just observe. Sure enough the screen goes off and comes back on. Eventually I can hear that the entire machine is switching itself off (Fans and all). The penny hasn't dropped yet but its edging to the ledge. She begins again and surely the machine shuts down. I start to press hard on every single key on the keyboard and all around. I'm thinking the keyboard is shorting on the motherboard (or something is) and the laptop goes into protection mode. When I touch it the laptop doesn't bat an eye - all business. This woman is literally hated by this laptop and the penny is tripping on the edge. She starts again and the laptop switches. This problem is literally with her. I tell her to use her left hand to type. Laptop says NO. I tell her use her right hand. Laptop is a happy camper. Finally the penny drops, I see she has long sleeves on and ask her to roll them up. What do I see? She has a smartwatch on her left arm. Smartwatch off please. Start typing. Laptop loves her and graces her with more than 10 seconds of screen time. 


FINALLY get to the cause: She had a smartwatch with a small strap that had a magnetic lock. This magnet was resting on the laptop at the exact spot that would trigger the magnetic switch of the laptop (which says to the laptop the screen has closed) and the laptop would go into sleep mode. I kid you not. A month of frustration was literally the laptop thinking she was closing its lid and it was happily sleeping for her. Lets just say the amount of mind blown was epic, lots of high fives and MD happy he can get work out of her and not spend money.

$Me: yours truly
$Ow: Office worker
$Cw: My amazing co-worker

Our story begins with me rushing to get out the door and swearing I wouldn’t forget my key cards by staring at them, only to walk out of the room right after to leave for work (Cue sleep deprivation, this bites me in the ass later).

Eventually, I realized this after I got in the elevator at my office, and couldn’t get to my floor :P

Luckily, the 15th floor of my building has public access as it’s the reception area, where I managed to text $Cw to come and get me.

Right as we get in, there’s an urgent ticket waiting for us. Instantly $Cw recognizes the ticket, as both of us have answered it several times before. It’s a mind boggling ticket really, as the issue is always the same. $Ow tells of a flickering screen that cuts in and out frequently, and that he needs it done ASAP as he needs to get his work done by noon.

We’ve previously fixed it by reinstalling drivers and whatnot, as $Ow has a thunderbolt dock that constantly has a USB-C conflicts with his monitors and laptop. 

$Cw and I head over to try and fix it for good.

$Cw: Hey $Ow, hows it’s going?

$Ow: Pretty good except for my stupid screen. Hopefully you guys can fix it this time, it’s going crazy and I just don’t know what to do anymore.

$Me: We’ll see what we can do. I take it the usual is happening?

$Ow: Yeah pretty much, it’s seems to have calmed down now.

$Cw proceeds to do the usual driver fix, only for it to do absolutely nothing.

$Me: Maybe it’s not the drivers?

$Cw: Have you dropped your monitor or hit it with anything lately?

$Ow: Nope, just moved those thick cables at the back so I had more room.

$Cw and I both peer around the corner only to see the display port cables contorted and almost flattened between $Ow’s desk and the wall.

(Commence internal screaming)

$Cw: I think I see the issue. Can you go back and grab a new cable?

$Me (not remembering I don’t have my key card): Yeah sure!

I ran back to our little office space and grabbed a new cable, only to trap myself as our “IT room” is secured, and my supervisor had let me in through one of the glass doors while he was leaving, but left before I could get through the other. 

There I was, realizing I was a complete moron for not sleeping earlier, forgetting my keys, and the worst part; leaving my phone inside the secured area. 

Long story short, I spent around 20 minutes staring at my phone through a glass door hoping $Cw would come get me. 

Eventually he did after realizing what I’d done (I swear he’s telepathic, super great guy) and we did get the cable to $Ow, and showed him how to move the cables without breaking them.

EOW: Good morning (she stretched that for no reason) I can't help you, you have to wait until the boss is here.

Me: No Problem ill wait.

&amp;#x200B;

So I sat down in the waiting area until the Boss arrived 15 minutes later.

I introduced me again and the conversation went like this:

Me: Hi I’m Nerofuia I come from a generic IT company, I’m here to migrate your PCs.

CB: Hi, didn’t EOW showed you my office, I told her you should start with my pc.

EOW: I did. He said he wants to wait until you are here.

CB: oh okay no Problem

(I was new at the job and didn’t want to escalate the situation so I let it slip)

Me: So I start with your office? Could you show me where it is?

CB: EOW will show you, I have to go to a meeting I will be back in 2 hours, It would be nice If I can work again then.

Me: oh no problem.

(A usual migration will take depending on the hard drive 1-1:30h if I’m fast)

The boss left and I was alone with EOW.

Me: Could you show me where the boss’s office is mam?

EOW: you should do my PC first, he won’t be back for like 2 hours and I have work to do.

Me: one PC will take nearly 2 hours and he told me to do his fist.

EOW: bullshit you IT guys just work slowly!

ME: No, sometimes we have to wait for the PC before we can proceed.

EOW: Fine! The boss’s office is locked. I’ll give you the key when I can work again.

(I was so done at this point but I had to remain friendly because I did not want to lose my job)

Me: Mam, I can try to do both PCs parallel, but you have to open the boss’s office, please.

EOW: NO! I. HAVE. WORK. TO. DO. Do my PC first.

&amp;#x200B;

She went loud, nearly screaming.

&amp;#x200B;

There was nothing I could do. So before I do nothing I started with her PC and the whole time she was standing right behind me and complaining that this is taking too long.

If an IT guy is fixing your PC and its taking longer PLEASE don’t do this!

So I was nearly finished with her PC and the boss arrived.

&amp;#x200B;

OB: Oh hey, you are already on the second PC?

Me: No…

Then EOW interrupted me.

EOW: NO! he did my PC first. And he is working sooo slow. If he wasn’t so slow both our PCs would be ready.

I was shocked, she SAW me working and SAW that I could not work faster.

OB to me: I told you, you should start with my PC, why didn’t you do that?

Me: OB told me to do her PC first.

EOW: NO! HE IS LYING!

Me: No, I’m not. She told me that your office is locked and she wouldn’t open it until she can work.

OB: My office is not locked. EOW is that true?

EOW was so entitled that she didn’t think I would tell her boss the truth.

She didn’t say a word.

I on this point was sure I would lose my job and was shaking.

OB in a louder angrier tone: is that true?

&amp;#x200B;

To my surprise, she said yes!

OB told me where his office is located and told me to go up and begin with my work.

I went as fast as I could.

I heard them arguing loudly but was not able to hear exactly what they said.

I was there two more days and she didn’t talked to me one single word.

&amp;#x200B;

Half a year later, I went there a second time and was greeted by a nice young woman at the reception.

I don’t know if she was fired or simply not there this day, but I like to think, that she got fired.

"This is one that is just unfolding, but my boss literally hit his head against the wall about it.  
We recently acquired about a dozen clients from a guy who had started his own MSP, but got in over his head and wanted out.  
We've been doing a lot of cleanup because he wasn't the best about following standard operating procedures, and this new one is a nightmare.  
One of the new clients had a host server die on them.  We got it back in house, repaired it, and recovered the VMs from backup.  But then the clients couldn't find any of their file shares.  
&gt;Coworker: Where are the host backups?  
&gt;Me: Host backups?  Why would we need those?  
&gt;Coworker: All their file shares were on their host.  
&gt;Me: The file server?  That VM should have been backed up.  It wasn't?  
&gt;CoWorker: No, their file shares are on the host.  
&gt;Me: WHAT?!?    

Shortly after, while in the systems of another of these new clients, I saw the same thing, a drive map to \\\HostServer\FileShare.

"A recent delve into the perils of remote support.

Sometimes, I have absolutely no doubt about the old adage about the crap floating to the top in any pool being accurate...

Last night, I get an out of hours email (support hours are generally 7 am to 7 pm, but we've got overseas users who we watch out for if we're still awake)

**User:** Please install $software_suite on my PC. We have purchased a license for it.

*sigh*. OK, he's kinda a medium fish in a small pond who is prone to arcing up if he's not pandered to with sufficient lesse majeste`, so despite it not really being a major issue, I'll do it since I haven't gone to bed yet.

**HeadAche:** Hi $user. Please download the installer and save it on your desktop and let me know your PC name, and I'll remote in and install it for you.

Our users do NOT have admin rights to their PC's - there's an agent which ""whitelists"" approved software so they can install it without admin credentials, but any software which isn't on the list needs someone with admin rights to install it. $software_suite wasn't in the whitelist.

Our remote access solution identifies PC's by their name - so accessing one is a matter of searching for the computer name. All staff know how to find their PC name - it's part of their induction.

**User:** Yes, I've downloaded the installer and saved it on the desktop

Freddie Uncle Charlie Katie. Did you miss the bit about the PC name?

**HeadAche:** That's great, but I need to know your PC name

Radio silence for 30 minutes or so.

**User:** Can you advise when you will install the software? I've downloaded it and saved it on my desktop like you asked.

Freddie Uncle Charlie Katie squared.

**HeadAche:** Yes, I know that, but I NEED TO KNOW YOUR COMPUTER NAME

**User:** The installer name is XXXX. I really need this software, can you please let me know when you will install it

At this point, I'm ready for bed and quite over this guys inability to read and comprehend what I'm asking

**HeadAche:** Well, since you seem incapable of giving me the information I need to know, and it's now pushing 11 pm, likely tomorrow, because I'm going to bed. I've asked you twice for your computer name. Your induction says when you log this kind of issue you must provide your computer name, and shows you how to find it. Send me your computer name and leave your PC on at the end of the day and I'll do it in the morning.

And with that, I logged off and went to bed.

Anyone wanna take a guess at the result the next morning? if you guessed ""No answer"", you win the bonus prize.

**NB:** For anyone asking why I didn't just search for his PC - we have over 1000 connected to the remote portal, and the names are an alpha numeric string which has no relation to the user - and which I have no means of looking up.",Reading and comprehension is obviously not a skill required to be a Really Important Guy!,0
"One of the roles my team fills is supporting the applications for Contact Centres. This ticket has gone on for a couple weeks now, so the actual exchanges are days a part. This is mostly due to the user being a overnight worker and our own night staff not understanding why this user still has issues.

Slightly more background. To log in as a contact centre agent, they need to enter their username, password, and application they are connecting to (ie phone).

Ticket comes in. ""User was working last night and was unable to log inti the system. They have screenshotted the error message and forwarded it on"". I open the screenshot. Big error message saying ""Cannot find application. Please check details and try again"". Just below this is ""Application: phone2"".

Me: Hey Team, user has entered the application name wrong. It should say phone, not phone2. 

I close the ticket. 2 minute job. User error. Done. 

Nope. Next morning the ticket is back. ""User is still unable to log in and has entered application name as phone correctly. Screenshot attached"". New screenshot. New error message. Just as obvious. ""Invalid username or password. Please check details and try again."" Now a detail I missed previously. Usernames in this software are case sensitive. No idea why, but they are. User has typed in 'USERNAME' but needs all lowercase. I assume most users don't know this, heck even I find it stupid. Alas, I reply.

Me: User has entered username as: 'USERNAME' but the application requires lowercase, ie. 'username'.

User isn't actually schedule again til the weekend, but the next Monday the ticket is back again. ""Still not working. User has tried everything [doubt that] and is still getting errors. At this point, the user has been unable to login for 2 weeks. We have escalated this ticket. Please check your application and configurations to fix this"". 

Ah yes, typical response we get from customers (note the customers go through their own service desk which then forwards issues to us). I check the newest screenshot and they have username: 'Username'. I quickly double check my previous email and see I had in fact typed mine as ALL lowercase. Phew. I go into the config and apply a temp password for the user so I can login as them. I screenshot the login page with all the correct details, and then again with the logged in application. I then attach these to the email and send it back. At this point I'm quite annoyed thst they are escalating a ticket that is clearly user error. This is where I stop being polite with my emails.

Me: ""User continues to type in details incorrectly. This is USER ERROR. Attached are screenshots where I have tested the user's correct log in details. As previously stated, user needs to enter username in ALL LOWERCASE"".

At this stage the user is off until the end of he week again so I haven't heard back yet. But 2 weeks of typing in your details wrong. At this point they are either taking the piss, or complete morons. My money is on the latter.",Surely it's on putpose at this point,0

"So we are doing some OS upgrades and there are two machines in a department. One had a larger multi-terabyte hard drive on it that store a lot of archived images and the other a similar drive with multiple videos on it. The picture ""archive"" has several years worth of photos but then they are taken off to CD or DVD for further archiving for several more years. The picture archive computer had Photoshop and etc to edit pictures and the video machine had Premiere and etc to edit videos. 

After talking with the manager and the digital editor we combined the two roles into one machine. Combined all of the drives and programs onto the new machine with the upgraded OS. The digital editor was more of a camera guy than a computer guy so I assured them that this would work.

Two weeks later the digital editor calls me and says ""What am I going to do I need my old machine back!!""

Me: Why?

Editor: Because we archive all of these files to disk after so many years and now how am I supposed to do that?

Me: There is a DVD burner on the new machine.

Editor: Yes, but I need my old machine.

Me: Why? The new machine can do that.

Editor: What new machine? 

Me: The new machine that we put in place. The video/picture editing machine? The machine on the desk beside you. Ten feet away from you.

Hygienist girl- HYG


Bit of backstory. This is a business in the healthcare field who has 4 locations, 3 are practices and one is a call center/admin area, that each use a separate  VDI specific to each site I set up for them to connect to each location and work from there remotely. Scheduling, notes, billing etc. They need local database access so they remote into the VDIs yada yada.

I get a frantic call from OM 
OM: “Hey we took this workstation from location A and need it set up at Location B right now to connect to %MedicalSoftware% database! It’s not installed on this computer!”

Me: ok well that’s not a problem let me remote in real quick and start the install.

OM: ok great thanks *hangs up*
  
I think nothing special these guys move PCs all the time god knows why, but they’re good clients who are usually receptive to our IT best practices advice and the doctors are good guys. I carry on with the work.

I finish the install and reboot the machine, upon reboot I log into %MedicalSoftware% and send off a message saying to OM that’s it’s good to go.  Log out and wait for the user to sign on. I see HYG now entering her credentials, but she stops half way through, and opens a VDI access shortcut on her desktop to the very same location she’s physically in.

I call in to the main line and ask for HYG.

Me: hey I noticed you’re using your remote access here as well, but the software is installed locally, so you don’t really need to use this connection.

HYG: oh I just needed this PC moved here so I would have my bookmarks with me. (Mind you, these guys are on Gsuite and all use chrome with sync) 

/HeadDesk

Me: so.. you guys didn’t actually need this workstation to move locations?

HYG: what do you mean?

I proceed to show her that she can just login to her Company Gmail and all her bookmarks appear in chrome. She’s all wide eyed and mystified.

"Hello there, so as I read through this subreddit I ended up recalling some stories from when I was in TechSupport and thought it would be nice to share.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened while I was on an internship in the deployment department of a quite sizeable company.

My job was basically to setup computers/printers to connect to our network and ship them while also answering to level 2 support request that involved hardware (failing drives, need more RAM, all this kind of stuff).

So this day one of the level 1 support guys comes to me and asks me if someone sent a printer to one of the companies agency. As I look up the name of the printer I recalled that I indeed setup and sent a new printer to this agency so I tell him to transfer me the call.

Me: Me - L: Lady that called

Me: It's me from deployment. I was told that you have an issue with the new printer I sent you.

L: Yeah. We installed it on the old one's spot but we can't get it to work. It got power and seems to work but we can't print to it.

Me: Ok, so first can I check with you if everything is plugged in correctly ?

(ensues usual verifications: is the power plugged in, is the internet plugged in, do they have internet in their office, and so on)

L: Yeah everything is plugged in.

Me: Just to make sure, could you plug back the old printer and see if it works ?

L: Ok, no problem.

I wait for a while, they put their old printer back and everything works. As everything seems to be ok in terms of hardware (note that I did test the printer before sending it and everything was working just fine) I start checking with them if I might have made a mistake configuring it to work in their agency.

We spent a good hour and a half checking every possible misconfiguration, reset the printer twice and set it back up and so on.

Me (starting to lose it as I can't find any possible cause): You sure eveything is plugged in right ? All cables are working ?

L (as tired as me): Yeah, we used all the cables that came with this printer.

Me: ... Wait, what cables did you say you used ?

L: Well those that were with the printer.

Me (finally getting it as I recall what was in the box): You mean you used the internet cable that was in the printer's box ?

L: ... Yeah, why ?

Me: ...Because there was no internet cable with the printer.

The printers we used didn't come with ethernet cables (RJ45), however they did come with a telephone one to use it as a fax (RJ11). Turns out they didn't notice that their ""ethernet"" cable didn't quite fit the printer nor the wall's socket. That was one big facepalm moment for the both of us.","Wait, you only used what was in the box ?",0
"Our IT department of 4 people caters to about 400 users. Responsibilities are divided in a way that creates little redundancy - put in other words, everyone of us supports about 400 users in his field of expertise.

&amp;#x200B;

My field of expertise is the helpdesk. I care for the users, their client hardware and the client software they are using. I also analyze, classify and troubleshoot everything else up to the point where I'm sure it's not a clientside or user problem, so I can hand it off to the responsible colleague.

Part of my responsibilities is to install software that's not available via our automated deployment system for whatever reasons.

As a rule of thumb, if we have an installer on our official app network share, you just give me a heads up and I'll install that for you. If we don't retain an installer for that app yet, I assume that we have not checked if we can use this software - be it for financial or security or other reasons.

$User: ""Oh, you can get an installer on the internet.""

TBD: ""Yes, I'm aware I can get an installer on the internet. However, I have to check certain things like the license / terms of service, make sure it doesn't come with spyware or adware, and other things.""

$User: ""I really need this quick. I thought you could just install it. We already have it installed on other machines, why are you making this so complicated?""

TBD: ""Sorry, I have to follow protocol, and if we don't retain an installer I have to assume we haven't audited this program yet.""

$User: ""You could just get an installer on the internet!""

TBD: ""Yes. But I can't just download and install any software, even if you show me you have it already installed on some machine. Please write a mail to the ticket system and I will start working on it.""

$User ""So I won't get help quick?""

TBD: ""Write a ticket and I will check, and if I find we can install that software I will install it for you. But I need an official inquiry from you, as a ticket.""

$User: (rambles some more, leaves office slamming the door) TBD: (shrugs it off, just giving my boss a heads up via instant messenger why we are the bad guys now)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What's more, $User did in fact write an email regarding his software problem. Not to the ticket system, though; but to my boss.

He couldn't be bothered to write a ticket, but he had enough time to write a complaint. Ironically, if he had put the ticket system into CC, we'd have a ticket that I could start working on.

My boss simply informed me that he received the complaint, but he has obviously opted not to make it into a ticket. I wonder why... :)

**I Expect You to Read My Mind**

So, a user calls in and unfortunately we mostly support hospitals which means Doctors. If you don’t support these nice folks, imagine the stereotypical User we’ve all heard horror stories about and then give that person a sense of authority that has 0 relevance to you but is everything to them. 

This fella calls in, says he talked to $Me yesterday. FALSE. I’d recognize this voice, but whatever, normally we’d just move on. He proceeds to say he called yesterday about “this issue”, and then vaguely mentions how when he closes a window another window opens in this application they use. I ask if he has an incident/ticket number, and no of course not. Ok fine, I can try and look it up other ways but lo and behold! There are no tickets from this guy any time recently with any relation to that issue. Cool. 

He says the application team he got forwarded to asked for examples of the problem, to which he told them the Help Desk has those examples which is impossible because we have no record of this guy calling us or reporting anything about an application problem. Anyway, he wants us to get those examples and immediately states that he has to go help patients, and to let him know as soon as we have those examples given to the application team. Wherein he vaguely mentioned the problem, gave us no time to remote in and check what issue he might be referencing, didn’t give us a device ID to remotely check or anything. 

Sure thing doc, we’ll get right on that issue you’ve now thoroughly pointed out and shown us, well done. Made me wonder how he’d feel if a patient walked up to him said “hey my insides hurt can you get on that?” and then walked off. 

**I’m totally me, now let me see those patient records**

&gt;$Me: *standard spiel that makes me reconsider existence each time *


&gt;$SecurityRisk: Hey, $Me, I need a password reset on *application that has a ton of patient info* 


&gt;$Me: Alright, just need to verify your identity, whats your security PIN?


&gt;$SecurityRisk: I’ve never had to do that before, can’t you just reset it? 


&gt;$Me: No, ma’am, that’s not how this works. I don’t know who did that for you before but we have to verify your identity since this has access to so much patient information ...*blah blah* So if you don’t know your PIN I can write this ticket over to a Security group and you can take it up with them tomorrow at 7 AM. 


&gt;$SecurityRisk: Well this is ridiculous, I need this right now and I’ve never had to do that before.


&gt;$Me: Sorry ma’am, you’ll have to take it up with the Security folks tomorrow.  (At this point I’m happy to say this because this is the concise version and she was becoming irritable and the tone of voice somewhat rude)


A few minutes later, my colleague gets a call. It’s a slow night so I’ve got one ear on his conversation because sometimes I can help him out or vice versa. Plus, he said the magic words. 

&gt;$ObliviousColleague: ...password reset. Sure we can do that, let me just login to *application with ALL the patient info* 

BOOM. What are the chances 2 of those calls back to back? And guess who? That’s right reader that’s made it this far into my ‘short’ stories! $SecurityRisk is back at it. I quietly motion my colleague to mute his phone and see her name on his screen. I inform him of what happened and say if she gets uppity, send her to his ‘manager’. To be clear, I am not a manager. Just a co-worker that doesn’t want this lady to try her BS this late when she’s already been told she’s wrong. 

&gt;$NowInformedColleague/Co-Conspirator: *goes through the PIN verification and tells her the ticket is being sent to Security already * Ma’am? Would you prefer to speak to my manager about this? 


This wonderful shit-eating grin spreads across his face as we both hear that confirmation that we so wished to hear. He passes the headset to me. 


&gt;$Me: Good evening, this is $ NowInformedColleague/Co-Conspirator’s manager $Me. $SecurityRisk, we’ve now both informed you that you can’t reset your password because we can’t verify who you are.

So, once it was set up, my mum couldn’t figure out how to “setup the flashlight” (which mind you didn’t exist) she passed it to me for help. All I did was go into settings and turn up the backlit screen from off. I explained to mum that it was a backlit screen but she didn’t know what that was so I called in my dad, who can describe things better than me. Once mum knew the difference, she completely denied ever saying it had a flashlight and still does even though she had a friend around who witnessed the whole thing.",Backlit Screens and Flashlights are different things,0

$Me: hello $IWAM, how are you doing today?

$IWAM: Hi, Oh I'm doing just great */s laugh*

$Me: */s laugh* Great, now , correct me if im wrong, you're having issues after BAD UPDATE right? 

$IWAM: Well, I am kind of your perfect storm it seems. Because the helpdesk always has a different fix for my issue and it's never fixed!

$ME: Gotcha, May I remote into your machine? 

I remote into the PC and I open up event viewer and see nothing about his issue. He had been experiencing crashing applications at random, even screenshots would crash. Connecting to our network one way would crash IE and he has to use this method AND IE. Started that day after updates. They were telling him he has to get reimaged. I took this as an opportunity to try to find a solution to the known issue. 

I was transparent about what I was doing, trying my best to put it into terms most people can understand. I had no information for what I was doing. This is technically entry level so we are mostly expected to fix a stray setting or Checkbos. Or to rebuild a profile. 
I saw a random event in event viewer that referenced a dll. Reinstalled the graphics driver cause of the screenshot thing. He didn't have a print driver in device manager, reinstalled that. Ran a system file checker. Had him reboot after each step. I did about another 30 mins of t/s for general usability and cleanup. And had him reboot a final time. Everything started working just like a dream. Finished it up with a convo about dogs and the guy was super happy. 

That is one of the best feelings right now for me. I am transitioning into other things but it is a great experience.

Edit: entire callasted about 3 1/2 hours",IT and Tech Support can feel extremely rewarding.,0
"It was a bright, sunny morning - birds were singing, the call queue was under control, the preventative maintenance up to date, and the office conversation was pleasant and lighthearted.  
In short, it was a perfect day at work.

TOO perfect. Clearly, something nefarious was afoot.

Caller ID flashed; the boss was calling. Time to lance this festering boil of pleasantness, and reveal the pustulent horrors within.

&gt; BOSS: Hey Gambatte!

&gt; ME: Hey Boss. What's up?

&gt; BOSS: Well, I've got good news, and I've got bad news...

Dammit. I knew it.

&gt; BOSS: The good news is that we're taking on a new customer, MAJOR_STORE!

&gt; ME: Nice! Do we have any information on what models of equipment they're using, service manuals, tech logins and whatnot?

&gt; BOSS: Well, uh, this came to us through SUPPLIER because they're using their equipment; apparently the original service provider for MAJOR_STORE just closed their doors and left all of their customers hanging with no notice.

&gt; ME: Uh oh. I have a sinking feeling...

&gt; BOSS: Yeah. The bad news is that we started as of Friday last week.

&gt; ME: Okay, we can...

&gt; BOSS: ...and you have three outstanding faults at your local store.

&gt; ME: Alright. Yeah, I can deal with that. Can you send through the fault information? I'll review it, and then contact the site managers about how we can best alleviate their issues until we can get a permanent fix in place.

&gt; BOSS: Well...

&gt; ME: No, let me guess. Because this is so new, we don't have a way to get the fault information into our system yet, so we know we have three outstanding faults - probably even case numbers - but no idea what they actually are?

&gt; BOSS: Yeah, pretty much. Have you played this game before?

&gt; ME: More often than I like. Alright, I'll head to site and figure out what's going on; the site manager might be able to pull the information from their system with those case numbers.

&gt; BOSS: Cool; let me know what you find out!

---

Less than half an hour later, I walked through the front doors of the store. I located a manager and introduced myself; we walked through the site induction and signing in process, then we started talking about the outstanding issues.

&gt; MANAGER: Well this printer prints funny. And so does this one.

&gt; ME: Okay, I had three case references for faults - do you know anything about this last one?

&gt; MANAGER: Uh... Oh, here it is! Yeah, we called in the same fault twice on two different days, and got two different case numbers.

Oh, this is going to be a fun site to look after.  
I tracked down model and serial numbers for all the equipment that had faults lodged against them, and departed. For now.

---

I found the manuals for the printers online. The poor printing quality was likely due to faulty print heads, so let's Oprah this - you get a new print head, and you get a new print head, everyone gets new print heads! Even the printers that they hadn't reported issues with, because they were in the minority. The one that was printing ""funny"" also got a replacement main logic board.  
In the space of three parts deliveries over about as many weeks, all of the outstanding faults were cleared.

&gt; ME: Hey Manager, I think we're done here - as best I determine, all of the reported faults are now resolved.

&gt; MANAGER: That's great! Does that include EQUIPMENT?

&gt; ME: ...What's wrong with EQUIPMENT?

&gt; MANAGER: I don't know. The screen's black?

&gt; ME: I don't have a call for it, but I guess I can take a quick look. If it's not a simple fix, you might need to log a call.

&gt; MANAGER: Great, thanks!

&gt; ME: ...I don't know where EQUIPMENT is.

&gt; MANAGER: Oh! Uh... There's seven identical installs scattered around the building, so just have a look around, I guess?

Great, I guess I'll just wander around until I find one that's malfunctioning? Well, we charge by the hour, so if they want me to wander about aimlessly, then the Customer Is Always Right.¹

---

¹ In this one, singular, very exact scenario; specifically, where it is at their expense, and I don't have anything else that I'd rather be doing.

---

After a few minutes, I identified not one, but two sets of EQUIPMENT that were non-functional.

The first was a very difficult problem, that took all of my many years of experience to correct.  
I plugged it back in.

The second was considerably more complex. On powering it up, the BIOS splash screen would flash up... then the screen would go black.

&gt; ME: Uh... Manager? I've got no information on this equipment; is that what it's meant to do?

&gt; MANAGER: ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

&gt; ME: ... Thanks.

After a few minutes of the screen continuing to be black, I gathered that the equipment was not in some sort of start up processing state.

&gt; ME: Okay, I think this has got something a bit more serious wrong with it - you'll have to raise a fault call so I can book some time and parts against it.

&gt; MANAGER: No problem, I'll book it right now!

&gt; ME: Great - I'll be back once I've got the job and the paperwork is in order.

&gt; MANAGER: Ha! I'm doing it right now; you won't even get out of the car park!

---

I made it out of the car park.

---

Two weeks later, a new job dinged into my queue. At long, long last, the job for EQUIPMENT had arrived.  
In the interim, we'd finally received the official process for investigating and troubleshooting EQUIPMENT - there was a special USB cable, a SD card, and a whole official and trademarked process detailing how to reload the files. Now that I had a job, I quickly drove back down to the store, extracted the EQUIPMENT, and brought it back to the workshop, so as to better follow the official processes.

Official process #1: Power up EQUIPMENT, connect the USB cable, and access internal storage to reload application files from external sources. RESULT: No dice. EQUIPMENT is completely unresponsive.  
Official process #2: Boot from SD card, copy application files from SD card to internal storage. RESULT: Nada. Boot menu doesn't even present on the screen.  
Official process #3: ...  
Unofficial process #1: Improvise? Uh, I mean, ""fall back on the skills and wisdom developed over years of experience"", aka poke at it and see what happens.

I consulted the manuals again - and again - and again. On what felt like the nine hundredth consultation of the system manuals, I happened to notice a diagram that demonstrated the position of a RESET switch under an almost unnoticeable pin hole. Given a severe lack of other options presenting themselves, I grabbed a paperclip and tentatively probed the recess.

And... nothing. No haptic or audible feedback; I might as well have been pressing a paperclip into the workbench. Intrigued, I reached for a screwdriver...

In moments, the case was open. Inspecting the switch revealed that pressing it produced the normally expected click. However, under the pin hole was a soft plastic cover - which had a small hole through it. The broken edges of the hole looked as if they might line up with the switch... Some short work with a sharp knife and some plastic cement² soon had it repaired well enough to no longer trigger the switch.  
A further few moments reassembling the case, and I was able to power up the EQUIPMENT - and this time, the BIOS splash screen lasted much longer than 10 seconds. After a few more moments, the store application loaded, and the EQUIPMENT appeared to be fully functional once again.

I grabbed the paperclip once again and applied it to the RESET switch. After holding it down for 10 seconds, the screen abruptly switched off.  
I watched, and waited, and watched some more.

After a moment of watching the system not boot up again, I was struck by a thought. I applied the paperclip once again - and the system immediately began booting.

The RESET switch was actually a POWER switch, and after being turned off, it needed to be turned back on again.  
The damaged cover had been holding down the POWER switch, so when it was powered up, it would get 10 seconds into the boot sequence - just enough to display the BIOS splash screen - then turn off.

² That these tools of my hobbies were readily available in the workshop should imply nothing about my utilization of work hours, because as demonstrated, there were *legitimate business reasons* for these tools to be present. /shiftyeyes

**TL/DR: Zero information about a new customer, zero preparation time, zero useful official processes received from on high. Still resolved all reported faults (and few that weren't) in the first few weeks.**

**Addendum:**

&gt; BOSS: Hey Gambatte, how has MAJOR_STORE been?

&gt; ME: Eh... Apart from their penchant for reporting a single fault multiple times, they haven't been too bad. Some of the managers can be a bit grumpy sometimes, but that's no different from any other customer. Why do you ask?

&gt; BOSS: Oh, okay. I was talking with some of the guys from SUPPLIER; apparently when they talk about MAJOR_STORE, the branch that always comes up as the example of the worst customer behaviour is the one closest to you.

&gt; ME: Well... Good to know, I guess? They've been perfectly reasonable, so far. I guess... I'll keep an eye on them, and let you know if they take a turn for the worse.

"So today is the day my uni decided to launch its new authentication server for the network. 

I have given my bosses at a minimum, a month heads up of what’s coming in this change and how to handle it.  

Well, Fast forward to today and NOTHING is connected to the network. As I sit in my summer class taking the first test of the term. My phone starts blowing up with everyone trying to understand why all networking stopped working. I quickly finish my exam so I explain all changes as thoroughly as possible.  

In essence, the change make it so you can only authenticate if you can access a captive portal (usually a networking agreement page) and if your device can’t use a captive portal, you can whitelist all your devices MAC address to bypass it. 

Now that I’ve explained how the new system works. The companies IT admin messages me asking what’s going on. I painstakingly explain the same system over the phone (a lot harder than it sounds especially to someone whose first language isn’t the same as yours)

Currently the system is running via the bypass method and against bosses wishes.  Just goes to show once again. Every university network is still god awful.

I'm the IT guy for a middle sized company. I do everything from managing the servers to responding basic ""How does this work"" questions. All internal stuff.

One day a colleague from accounting ($CA) forwards me an e-mail, forwarded to her by another colleague from controlling ($CC), asking $CA if the matter was taken care of. In short, the original e-mail was from our ISP, stating the requested changes were made as requested.

$CA forwards the message to $Me, asking if I know what this is about.

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: It's about the changes to our accounts that were neccessary.

$CA: Yes. But is it done?

$Me: ... Please don't take this the wrong way, but I really don't know what else to tell you other than what is in the original e-mail, literally stating that the changes were made.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of minutes later, I hear $CC and $CA talking around the corner of my office (I usually keep my door closed because I usually listen to music. Today I forgot my bluetooth speaker, so the door stayed open). Basically that my answer was typically IT and some other stuff I didn't quite made out.

"This is a short one, but it seriously damaged what little faith I had left in humanity.

I work for a company where most of the revenue generators work from home. We are affiliated with the Travel Industry. I am the System Administrator, but I do most of the Tech Support, in addition to System Admin duties.

We have had a string of equipment failures due to improperly protected computer equipment over the last few weeks. Most of these were able to traced back to power strips that had inadequate surge protection when they were brand new, and some of these powerstrips were over a decade old.

I was able to convince the company that a $15 to $20 surge protector was worth the investment to protect about $2,000 worth of equipment. I selected a surge protector on amazon and went through the tedious chore of sending 1 to each person's home. This morning, not even an hour ago, my boss got an email from a user, the subject line of this posting, was the only content of the email.

I received mine, please call me with instructions when you are ready.

A surge protector. So my boss forwards me this email and asks me to email all users who got a surge protector instructions on how to install.

I have this one co-worker, we will call her Liz for the sake of this story, who is laughably computer illiterate and has next to no critical thinking skills. 

One night at work she comes to me and says the computer won't let her login. She brings me to said computer in our back room and scans her badge to login and it prompts her to input her password. (keep in mind, Liz had worked here for several weeks at the time of this story and I had had to help her call our help desk on NUMEROUS occasions to reset her password)

Liz: What am I supposed to type in here?

Me: (facepalming internally) Your password?

Liz: but it's not working! What password am I supposed to use???

Me: The same password you use to login to your email, the schedule, our HR software, and our medical record program. (very secure I know. This isn't by our choice, it literally sets the password for everything to be the same when we have to reset it every 90 days and there's no way to have individual passwords for every program, I've tried)

Liz: I tried that but it's still not letting me in!

She proceeds to hunt and peck type in an all lower case password (our system has a requirement that there be at least one upper case and one number)

Me: (About to headdesk more than just internally) there should be at least one upper case letter in your password. Are you SURE you're typing it in EXACTLY as you set it?

Liz: That matters??

Me: yes.... Passwords are case sensitive for a reason. If you capitalized a letter when you set your password you need to capitalize it every time you login. 

This was not the last time I had to help her with basic stuff like this either. If there's any interest, I can post more stories to do with her as well as some of my other escapades helping people with basic computer stuff here at work. 

Needless to say I had a beer or two when I got home at 8 the following morning. The funny thing is, I am NOT tech savvy AT ALL.

Me: *Well ok we sort of need to know that and ... hey these documents are filled out dynamically based on whomever is logged in, so the documents will reflect whomever is logged in, their name will be on the document...*

"Around 2015 I was working as a Senior Developer (and occasional 3rd line support) at $company, a London-based software house that provides financial software to most of the world's big investment banks. One day I get an instant message from a senior client manager, $bob, explaining that something's gone wrong in $bigbank and they're unable to do any business (specifically, ECM and DCM deals - so they're not able to participate in IPOs, follow ons, etc). They're losing millions of dollars per day. They want to know if it's our software at fault. This is easily the biggest issue I've ever had the pleasure of being involved in - I had no idea what I was getting myself in for.

&amp;#x200B;

Following $bob's instructions, I join a conference call.

Immediately, I hear an american voice saying ""Is that $company? Is the developer from $company here?"" and I introduce myself,

$me: ""Hi folks, Timje here, I'm a senior developer from $company-""

$voice1: ""-Excellent. When was the last time a new build of your software hit our system?-""

$voice2: ""-Is there any reason why X pipeline would start refusing connections to Y connector?-""

$voice3: ""-We're seeing an outage that formed around 32 hours ago where we're not seeing anything in $MysteriousSoundingDashboard ...""

$me: ""Ah, yes, good, I'll have to look into these things and get back to you"" \*I mute myself while they continue to throw questions around, often talking over one another\*. Some of the voices are shouting. I can't tell how many people are on the call, but it's more than ten. I'm trying to write down their questions but many of them are above my paygrade - I'm a codemonkey, they're asking for big picture stuff. Much of what they're asking can only be answered by their internal IT team.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I get an instant message from $bob -&gt; ""Sorry about this. Some of these guys have been on this call for 30 hours.""

The penny drops. Jesus fucking christ, those poor bastards. I'm sure they're well paid for it, but these poor fuckers, the super tech support team, have been trying to work out why they aren't getting any deals through their pipeline and have been calling up every software provider the bank uses, asking for insights. They've been fishing for answers for 30 hours. And in the meantime one of the world's biggest investment banks is crippled.

So I ask them what's changed in their side - around four weeks ago they started blocking all SSL3 traffic because of poodle, but they were assured that everything uses TLS by now. Also everything worked fine after the changeover (until now).

&amp;#x200B;

I bring up the code for the crusty little pipeline we built for $bigbank, $shitconnector.  I was the last person in London to touch it, which is why I got roped in to this call. It was built around a decade ago, and uses c# code compiled into .dlls that are then somehow stored in a SQL database and run as stored procedures - it's a shitshow. The project only opens in visual studio 2005.It takes data from our current system (a ten year old piece of software that organises and manages DCM, ECM deals and mergers / aquisitions) and converts it into data from our last system (retired in the early 2000s) and then maps that and pipes that over to our main competitor's system. It's a secret piece of software that isn't supposed to exist, it's not been properly supported for years, and its existence is secret because our system is Absolutely Not Compatible with our competitor's. Its test suite has 150 tests, 100 of which have never been known to work. Noone really knows how to certify that it functions, as we don't even have documentation about the data formats it uses.

&amp;#x200B;

I pull the latest from source control. One of our European offshore friends made a small change around 6 months ago, to the handshake / login protocols, which includes this line of code:

`ShitConnector.Service.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Ssl3;`

Now this is smells suspicious, but after a bit of digging I learn that this 'upgrade' was deployed to their servers five weeks ago, and their system's only just fallen over now. I ask the chaps on the phone if it's been a particularly busy time lately - no, it's been pretty quiet. Their pipeline's fallen over and our software does make up a key part of it, so we might be at fault. But nothing's happened in the last few days that would indicate that the issue lies with us.

So I message $bob -

$me: I think I see a potential issue. This might all be our fault

$bob: What. Really? Jesus christ this is huge. Please tell me it's not our fault.

$me: I can't prove it yet, the timelines don't match up, but it looks like our latest deployment has something in it that only works with SSL3, which they recently disallowed.

$bob: OK. Let me know when you know more.

So I dig into how the handshake works. It looks like if connection isn't available when a message needs to be sent, it'll reconnect, get a new token and store that in the database, and then send the message. After the handshake succeeds, the connection token is stored in the database and used in future communications, so the handshake's only actually used after the connection is dropped by something else.

So the penny drops. It's been quiet over at the bank.

Maybe quiet enough for the server to go to sleep?

So here's how to build a timebomb. Five weeks ago, our nasty code goes into place. Four weeks ago, they block all non-TLS traffic (I.E. SSL2, SSL3). Presumably they have to identify the traffic to block it, via the handshake. A few days ago, their servers go quiet enough to recycle (or maybe it was scheduled, or something else got in the way). And when our program is called again, it starts up, creates a new connection, and forces the protocol to be SSL3. Boom, millions of dollars lost while everyone panics.

&amp;#x200B;

The fix was trivial, literally a one line fix, but we had to make it sound like it was a big patch - if anyone at $bigbank found out that they'd lost millions on a one-liner, they'd have gone berserk. As I understand it, though, the relationship carried on, and that one rusty $shitconnector is still plugging away today, moving all of $bigbank's deals through our software into our competitors through black magic and duct tape.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT -&gt; I can now recall more of the details, so let me go into specifics -&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://blog.sqlauthority.com/2008/10/19/sql-server-introduction-to-clr-simple-example-of-clr-stored-procedure/](https://blog.sqlauthority.com/2008/10/19/sql-server-introduction-to-clr-simple-example-of-clr-stored-procedure/)

The application was c#, compiled into DLLs and run as stored procedures inside a SQL Server database. It's called a CLR stored procedure. The stored procedures resembled the stored procedures of the old deprecated program (i.e. same name, same parameters... the stored procs were used as the.. interface?..) - so basically our competitors could fire data at what looked like the stored procedures of our old system -&gt; but instead this executes some c# that creates an HTTP client, does some sort of handshake and then starts making API requests to our 'newer' program. So basically it was a pipe for getting data from our competitor's export function into our newer import APIs. I'm sure it was a fuckin mess when it was written, but now?.. It was undocumented, the tests didn't run and noone had a harness to simulate the data that would be coming in. 

  
The timeout means that this poor SQL Server box must have been making outbound calls to our API and keeping the connection open for weeks at a time...",A US bank is losing millions per day.. I think it's our fault,0

"I’ll make this one short because I’m still kinda pissed about being yelled at about something someone else agreed to pay for. 

I work for a company that does a lot of remote network maintenance. I have a new client who recently had their IT guy leave, for what I assume is greener pastures, and they have a server that my Labtech agent detected had not been rebooted in… 1638 days. Yeah, 4 and a half years. I didn’t believe what I was looking at either. It’s Windows Server 2012 with a hypervisor sitting on it. 

So I billed the customer 1 hour of level 1 remote support ($125) and called it a night. Even though that was a solid 6 hours of updates. It’s a fire-and-forget kind of thing and I just watched it reboot a bunch of times while I played Satisfactory on PC. (Check it out, good game).

That was about two weeks ago. So, this morning I get a call from the client, angry as a slapped hornet’s nest, wanting to know why they have an invoice for $125 for a “server reboot”. I explained to the client that I did 4 and a half years of updates overnight and that required several reboots over the course of 6 or 7 hours. I only billed one hour because it’s probably not their fault that it was that way. Your last IT guy was a complete idiot. 

I ended up removing the charge as a one-time courtesy and showing the customer in the contract he signed where we will be rebooting his server every 30 days for regular scheduled maintenance and I will only bill 30 minutes each time ($62.50/month) to keep his server updated. The only reason I billed 1 hour was because holy shit dude your server wasn’t rebooted in 4 ½ years. You want me to just do shit for free?","Don't worry about what it says, just sign the contract.",0
"I'm out at my DR facility for the week with my datacenter admin. He rarely gets to come out here, because it's expensive. This is effectively a lights-out facility. It needs to be 100% remotely managed since we can't just have someone drive up here and fix hardware problems. Yes, we can have the datacenter staff do stuff, but the cost is low and we got what we paid for. I REALLY wouldn't trust them in the cage with anything more simplistic than replacing a failed hard drive. My datacenter admin needed a month to get everything done. Our boss sent me with him to cut that time down. The two of us would need 2 weeks. We got one. Tomorrow is our last day out here.

&amp;#x200B;

The past week has been a flurry of work. Installing some new storage in the array controllers, upgrading our VM hosts, and decomming some unused equipment. Then there's the firmware updates.

&amp;#x200B;

We're an HP shop, and we've got a ton of HP servers at our primary location. Brand new Gen10 Synergy 12000 Bladecenter. Gen8 ProLiants for our DB servers. Good stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

At DR, it's a different story. Gen8 VM hosts with firmware current as of last year when they were upgraded to ESXi 6.5. The Infrastructure and monitoring systems? Those are Gen6 and Gen7 boxes. And they needed to be relocated to a different rack. So I get the Gen7 firmware pack ISO, burn it to a thumb drive (by copying the ISO directly to the raw device), and I try to access the iLO so I can remote console in (it's COLD in the cage), but the iLO doesn't respond. No biggie. Hook a keyboard and monitor to the server and boot from the thumb drive.

&amp;#x200B;

Except the server boots the OS instead. I check the BIOS settings. Boot from USB is at the top of the list. USB is enabled (I know this because this system was used to burn the ISO image to the thumb drive). It just won't boot.

&amp;#x200B;

It's late, so I go back to the hotel and login remotely. I launch the HP Smart Update Manager and point my web browser at it. I tell it to update the firmware, which it does.

&amp;#x200B;

Except the iLO. That fails.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask the all-knowing Intarwebs for help. If your iLO version is below 1.20, you MUST update to 1.28 FIRST. Current is 1.88.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at 1.00.

&amp;#x200B;

It's NEVER been updated.

&amp;#x200B;

Which is probably why the system wouldn't boot from the thumb drive. Apparently there were some BIOS bugs that stopped Boot From USB from working correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

Our DR site is the redheaded-stepchild of the organization. It's neglected and abused. Chained up in the closet.

&amp;#x200B;

I have today to update 6 DB servers, and I've only got buy-in from the DBA team for half of them. If I can get these done, I'll be able to better administrate these things remotely.","Old, Neglected Equipment, OR, This Place Is A Disaster!",0

"But not all bosses are weak, cowardly weasels. Some will eat crow when it's on the menu.

Hapless Hank works for a retail chain with a couple of dozen stores in three states. He's been there since the era of dumb terminals and analog data lines, and he built today's VPN based WAN for the Windows point of sale system from the ground up. He's been with the company for a long, long time, and it has worked out well for the company and for Hank.

One of the reasons it has worked out well is that he has trained his boss well. The boss, who we shall call Bob, because that's not his name, is the #2 guy in the company, and is rather more tech savvy than most execs. But he knows his limits. He also knows that if he asks Hapless Hank technical questions, trying to sound smart for the owner, he'll get technical answers until his eyes glaze over and he asks for an executive summary.

The bottom line is, if Hank is out of the office for the rare vacation, Bob the Boss can handle most of the routine stuff that comes up. And when something needs to be done, Bob the Boss and the owner tell Hank what they want, Hank tells them what it will cost, and they say yeah or nay, and everybody gets on with their job.

Hank has been with the company for a long time because he likes working there, and they keep him around because he does the job well.

A virtual paradise of IT work.

But even the Garden of Eden has its snake. And occasionally, that snake will bite someone. In this case, it actually bit someone who had it coming.

The main point-of-sale server had been spontaneously shutting down for no apparent reason, and going through some acrobatics on reboot. It didn't take long for everyone, including the support desk at the vendor, to agree that it sounded like the UPS was going bad. (The electrical service in the neighborhood was . . . less than perfectly reliable, and occasional blips were not uncommon.) But nobody was certain enough to foot the bill to replace it without a test. So a test was in order.

The server was, of course, running on a state of the art *nix operating system. The sort that really doesn't like not being shut down properly (hence the acrobatics on reboot). Bad things can happen, like corrupted file systems. Hapless Hank knew this, and explained it carefully to Bob the Boss using small words. But this was early in their relationship, and Bob hadn't yet learned that when Hank was certain about something, he was almost always right. And Bob was feeling a little cocky.

&gt;Bob: Let's just unplug the UPS from the wall and see what happens.

&gt;Hank: That's a bad idea. It could corrupt the file system. The server wouldn't boot, and somebody would have to spend the next four and a half hours doing a restore from the backup tape. Then the stores would have to go through the logs and manually reenter all the business that happened before it died. And we'd have to enter all the credit card stuff as cash, so the books would be a mess. You know our controller won't like that at all.

(Yeah, it really took that long. There was a lot of data, and the drive was chosen more for reliability than speed. And it was a long time ago.)

&gt;Bob: Oh, it'll be fine.

&gt;Hank: I really advise against it. We need to shut the server down first (which involves notifying all the stores to go offline, because neither of our adventurers wanted to come in after hours).

&gt;Bob: That'll take a half an hour by the time we call everyone, shut it down, and boot it back up. And the stores hate going offline. And it's dinner time. It'll be fine.

&gt;Hank: If it doesn't boot back up, I'm not staying to do the restore. 

&gt;Bob: Fine. If it doesn't boot back up, I'll stay and do the restore.

You already know the rest of the story. I went out to dinner at a nice steak house. Bob, IIRC, had stale donuts, watching the percentage restored sloooowly count up for four and a half hours, while all the stores were offline. Accounting was unhappy the next morning because nobody could balance the books and do the bank deposit until they'd manually rekeyed everything and uploaded all the offline transactions. Bob the Boss didn't have an especially happy day, because crow is not tasty, even with salt.

These days, Bob the Boss does not *always* listen to Hapless Hank. But when it's a warning of possible technical problems, it's the way to bet.","The boss isn't always right, but he is always the boss.",0
"A long time ago, I was interviewing for a job I start in two weeks. I'd gotten the interview because my side hustle was on the retail side of this company. The specifics of the job aren't important, but part of it was/will be creating an application for the IT help desk. Part of their interview barrage was talking to two people who managed the help desk to see how we got on.

As I we started the interview, we did the same thing as the previous four times.  Who are we all?  I'm $ME, here to find your pain points and use $PLATFORM to build apps to alleviate those, if you all like me.  She's $HARDWARE, czar of devices.  Since we're retail, there are many many computers, scanners, tablets, label printer, etc... across the country.  He is $HELPDESK, helpdesk monarch, and he despairs of all the ways people report issues. He really wishes people would just submit tickets, which is the first I heard of any process to submit tickets, tbqh.

Here we stop and get ready to move on. Unfortunately $HELPDESK has reminded me of something.  I noticed an issue with registers a couple months ago, so let's get this interview off the rails.

&gt; $ME: So, I'm sorry to do this, but you reminded me of POS issue.  There's passwordless Powershell acess as an administrator

&gt; $HELPDESK, Confused: Well, yes, that would be an important issue!

&gt; $HARDWARE: &lt;stares confusedly&gt;

&gt; $ME: Uhh, you guys know I'm a $RETAIL_EMPLOYEE_NICKNAME, right?

&gt; $HELPDESK: No, we didn't. Wait. Are you saying that's something we have?

&gt; $ME: Yeah. Across our entire store.  Maybe others?

&gt; $HELPDESK: Well, this is definitely the weirdest way I've gotten a ticket filed.  That seems important.

&gt; $HARDWARE: &lt;still looks bemused&gt;

And we move on with the interview.  It went well beyond that.

-----

A couple weeks later (two weeks ago), I get my offer and resign from my main gig.  At lunch I drive over to the retail store and give them the news.

They're happy for me but sad I'm leaving.  I am too, they're great people.  As I'm walking out, I hear my manager talking to one of my co-workers, mentioning that helpdesk is sending someone out to do register maintenance. They haven't done that since these were installed a year and a half ago.

Guess it was repeatable. My manager cracked up when I told him that was my fault. I blame him for all this.  He asked me to reset the network connection a couple months ago, and that's when I found the bug.

And yesterday, I was hanging out with a friend in management at another store. Everybody is getting patches for their registers.  Oops!

Edit: One person said they were confused, so in a sentence or two: An interviewer complained about all the unofficial ways he gets tickets.  I proceeded to give him a high priority ticket involving tech support on-sites to 100+ stores across America.",Passwordless Problems,0
"This morning, I'm on a call with someone in another country, and my manager comes in brandishing a 3.5"" floppy disk.

I thought he was about to make fun of my retrocomputing hobby, as he does sometimes, so I ignored him at first - but then he said ""whoever it is, put them on hold"". This usually means a major issue, so I complied.

""All robots in the factory are down,"" says $boss. ""Critical files needed to restore production are on this floppy disk. We are not aware of any backup medium.""

I unmute the caller and tell him I'll call him back a bit later.

I take the disk and look it over. ""Last updated: 8/3/97,"" I muse. ""Just do what you can, and quickly!"" urges $boss.

Floppy drives were phased out in the business 7+ years ago, but there are two legacy servers still equipped with floppy drives.

I skip down to the server room and try the disk in the first server. Open up Windows explorer... drive is not appearing.

OK, let's not waste any time troubleshooting - we'll try the other one. It won't read the disk.

There are no USB floppy drives anywhere on campus (or if there are, they have excellent hiding spots).

As it happens, last Friday I had a retrocomputing meet to which I had taken my Win95 gaming rig (for a bit of multiplayer LAN goodness). And as it happens, it was still set up in my garage, so I screamed home, used the rig's drive to copy the contents of the floppy to the HDD, then zipped up the directory, FTPed the zip to my NAS and then emailed it via OWA on my home laptop directly to the guys responsible for getting it back up and running.

Order is restored!

I don't think I'll be catching crap about my hobby for a little while.

**TL;DR:** Floppy contains critical files. Nobody has a PC with a floppy drive, except for the retrocomputing geek. Production resumes.

"Backstory:

My dad spent a summer during college working at \[insert credit card company here\]. He worked a customer service phone line with a bunch of other teens working this same summer job. They used to get in trouble when customers would complain and ask to elevate the call to a supervisor, so they developed a system where they pretended to be each others supervisors. It worked very well. Now to the story:

Cast: CC: clueless customer MD: my dad PS: pretend supervisor

MD : Thank you for calling \[insert credit card company here\] This is MD, how can I help you

CC : Hi I used your credit card last month, and today you sent me a bill

MD : That can sometimes happen. In fact I'd be surprised if it didn't. What is your question

cc : This bill says I need to pay for these charges

MD : Oh, Are you saying you didn't make these purchases

CC : No, I bought them. I just didn't think I'd have to pay for them

MD : Why would you think that : /

CC : Because this is a rewards card, And I thought I could just go out and collect my rewards

MD : Oh, I'm very sorry. The way this card works is that, like any other credit card you have to pay for what you purchase. What makes our card special is that you earn \[rewards\] on top of what you purchase

CC : That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard! I DEMAND to speak to your supervisor

MD : (smiling and nudging his friend next to him) Just a second ma'm. I'll connect you

...

PS : Hello ma'm, MD has explained the issue you're having.

CC : Yes, and I don't understand how this could be happening!

PS :  Oh, I'm very sorry. The way this card works is that, like any other credit card you have to pay for what you purchase. What makes our card special is that you earn \[rewards\] on top of what you purchase

CC : Oh, I see. And thank you for clarifying. That makes so much more sense. I'm glad somebody there knows what they're doing.

"Another story reminded me about this one.

I was at a place where things were falling apart.  Stale cases built up in our buckets because we kept on reducing the support staff to save budget.  If a customer stopped responding, we didn't chase them down.  We rarely had time to scrape through our queue to follow-up on old cases.

We got a new VP of Customer Success.  She contracted out a support team in India and got rid of our team in Southern California.  She replaced 3 very experienced people with a team of 12.  Sounds good, but this team of 12 was new, and they were put on the phones immediately.

She then handed down a new rule that we (US team) could absolutely do no overtime except for a max of 2 hours a week for on-call escalation consult (we didn't work directly with the customer for these, only the India team).  When our shift was over, we were to warm transfer any active cases to the overseas (oursourced) team.  No Exceptions.  My direct manager tried to push back against this new rule but he was told to pound sand.

I was on a call with a customer who also happened to be an investor and they had a seat on our board.  I usually hand-held them through things, and I did a lot of after-hours stuff with them.  They pretty much just worked with me most of the time.  It got close to 5PM and I told them that ""due to new policies, I will have to hand this call off to the next shift.""  I got a little pushback, however the other guy understood office politics well enough to know that I had to hand him off.  He asked to speak to my manager.  My manager agreed to take the call and I handed it off to him.  I then clocked out and went home.

Well, the overseas team couldn't help the customer.  He asked that the case be escalated and they did so.  It ended up back in my queue, but I was not allowed to even check in with the case.  The guy emailed me directly and I explained that we have new rules and I can't go around them.  I also told him that since was not scheduled to be on-call this weekend, I'm not allowed to work on the case.  The guy that was already on-call had maxed out his 2 on-call hours for the weekend on Friday night.  The case sat until Monday.

On Monday, I jumped back on and got them fixed in about 30 minutes.  The guy warned me that his boss raised a big stink with us, but they explained the situation and that it wasn't my fault since I was following orders - I should be all-good.  Come Monday afternoon (because everybody else comes in later then tech support), I got hauled upstairs with my direct manager, HR and the CEO.  A folder with my name was sitting on the desk of HR.  I'm pretty sure it was my termination letter (because fuck me, right?).

They asked me to explain what happened, and why did I suddenly ""refuse"" to help our customer/investor and board member.  I explained what happened, and that I followed the rules to the letter.  My boss jumped in and said ""He followed the rules as set by VP.  I got on the phone and repeated the rules to the customer.  I also told them that our VP set these rules and that there were to be no exceptions, and they accepted the transfer to the new guys.""

My boss then said ""here is an email I got from the customer, as well as a copy of the phone conversation.  I don't know what kind of bullshit you guys heard, but you can see in the email here, they love our guy, and they want us to fix our policy.""  He pulled out another email and said ""here's the policy from VP - as you can see, she is very explicit that there are no exceptions.""

At this point I was excused from the room and sent back to continue my day.  Later on, my boss comes downstairs and calls me into his office.  He shuts the door and said ""listen to this.""  He played back some of the meeting that he recorded on his phone.

I couldn't hear everything, but basically, they got the VP on the speaker phone and tore her apart.  She tried to back-peddle and said ""I already talked to TS-BOSS (my boss) and he of course knows there are always exceptions, JAZZB54 doesn't know what he is doing - I'll take care of it."" My boss spoke up and yelled out ""bullshit!  Read the fucking email she sent me."" (my boss could be an belligerent ass, but he was always fair).

HR read the email exchange the VP had with my boss out-loud, including the part where she emphasized that there were to be no exceptions.  Recording ended at that point.

Later that week, it was announced that my boss was the interm-VP of Worldwide Customer Success.  The previous VP was moved to VP of Operations.  It was the 3rd time she was re-assigned.

Things went back to the way they were.  Backlog still sucked, but we were at least able to help customers that worked with us.  We got back our overtime and started booking 20+ hours of overtime a week.

A short time later, I left for a job that paid much more, and I only had to work 40-45 hours a week.  I still keep in contact with my former boss.  The stories he tells me... I'm surprised they are even still in business.

TLDR: New VP fucked shit up.  I almost got thrown under the bus but my boss saved me.  VP didn't get fired, but I found a new job.","New VP ""improves"" the process and almost gets me fired.",0
"I am the entirety of the tech department at a large music school. I do everything, from computer purchasing and provisioning, to software support, to admin duties on 5-7 different systems, all deep data pulls and reporting, phone systems, printers, websites, kiosks, lighting, plumbing, fixing door knobs and chairs, staple removers and chairs... and AV. 

I set up (and *fully* tested the day before) a MacBook connected via HDMI to a receiver that feeds audio to surround sound speakers and an HDMI projector: literally plug and play except on some older Dell laptops that die if you connect HDMI while the thing is actually running. Yesterday, gorgeous sound through the sound system, took a minute to realize we had to change the video output from 1080p to 1080i to keep the image from bleeding out of the white screen area (I’m looking up the differences as soon as I’m done posting this). 

So, knowing it works, I set it up the exact same way today, knowing I would have about 120 kids and 60-80 parents watching us screen 3 short movies the kids filmed over the past two weeks. I’m cool, everything is 5x5, plugged in the laptop, instantly got video, let’s do this. 

Director introduces the program, it’s the first time doing short films at this camp, the school finally has the tech, this should be awesome. I kill the lights, hit play on the MacBook, the title sequence plays, the film starts... silently.  F*#%!

Reset the HDMI connection (unplug/replug). Computer audio out shows as muted. It can not be changed. Change HDMI inputs on the receiver. I’m starting to sweat, the director goes back up to do a Q&amp;A (best advice as a film maker? Don’t trust technology!) while I continue trouble-shooting. Other inputs work just fine. Go back to the input for the laptop. Silence. Check audio/sound options. I can pick internal audio or the receiver. Internal audio works fine. Picking the receiver mutes the laptop. Power cycle the receiver. Silence. Reboot the laptop. Can’t get it to login. Director announces his password in front of the entire crowd. I laugh, tell him to change it when we’re done, and still can’t login. Take the laptop up to him on stage so HE can type it in. It finally logs in. Try the HDMI again. Silence. It feels like 20 minutes have passed, but was probably just 5-10. Finally have a brain wave...

Sprint to my office to grab an 1/8”-RCA cable, grab a powered speaker out of the closet where the HDMI receiver lives, plug the laptop directly into the speaker, and SOUND GLORIOUS SOUND!! I get the best/worst standing ovation of my life. Kids chanting my name. Seriously, it should have been awesome. Thinking about it, I kind of want to cry instead. Movies get screened, child filmmakers get mad props, everyone ELSE has a great time, I get lots of congratulations for “fixing” it. Makes me feel worse. 

I just want to plug in that same laptop to that same HDMI cable on Monday and have the f^#king thing work. I have literally never had a problem with this AV setup that a simple unplug/replug, reset the HDMI signal approach wouldn’t fix. Now I’m confused and scared there’s something else going on. Which, if there IS, I hope it’s on the f^#king MacBook and NOT my AV system. 

What I realized: I never tested the **audio** today. I saw the video pop up as expected and *assumed* everything else was fine.

"As mentioned before, I'm an Enterprise Fiber guy so I only deal in a layer 3 connection with a layer 2 switch (most times) a the demarc. 

About three years ago, guy called in absolutely livid about packet loss across his internet circuit. 

Me: ""No problem, sir. Lemme check out the circuit. What's your circuit ID?"" After he gives me the circuit ID, he says, ""Yeah, my VoIP provider says that your route is causing me to drop packets. So you're costing me money on my calls! I've been dealing with this from you for weeks!""

I pull the circuit and, of course, I'm not seeing any issue. I ran a ping test and traceroute from the core to Google's DNS and a public IP from a well-known source as well as from three public looking glasses.

Me: ""Sir, I'm looking at this circuit and there is no issue. The optics are clean, the route is having no issues and all three looking glasses agree with our results.""

Cust: ""I'm sick of this. I'm bringing on my VoIP provider and y'all are going to fix this issue now!""

He puts me on hold and brings on a rep for his VoIP.

Rep: ""Well, sir, we are seeing drops to you VoIP device on site so this is an ISP issue.""

Me: ""Sir, the circuit hasn't dropped once and I assume your VoIP provider is checking remotely. Do you have a connection that isn't using either one of us?""

Cust: ""Yeah.""

Me: ""Ok. Can you run a continuous ping to your gateway's IP and your VoIP provider's IP at the same time? If you want, you can run a ping to Google's DNS and your VoIP provider's IP in the circuit, too.""

The guy starts his test and the rep says something snide but not loud enough to be clearly heard.

Cust: ""Ok both are running. Hold on...what the hell is this?! Hey, (VoIP rep)? Why the hell am I showing packet loss to your IP but not to my gateway?!""

Rep: ""That's because you're using a coax modem to ping and coax connections aren't guaranteed to-""

Cust: ""But I'm not losing a single packet to my ISP gateway and I'm not even on their network!""

Rep: ""Again, that's because you're on a coax connection and-""

Cust: ""Really?! Fine, let's run this on the fiber.""

He sets it up and says...

Cust: ""Oh yeah there's a big difference now. The pings to Google's DNS are much better and you're still dropping packets!""

Rep: ""Well, sir, it could be an issue with the routing-""

Cust: ""That shit doesn't make any sense!! I'm even using a looking glass and packets are dropping to your IP!! You all told me that my performance is great to the internet! I haven't dropped a single damn packet to the internet but your shitty service is constantly dropping! You all told me that it was my provider for weeks and it's been your shit!! I've wasted money on this! How do you explain this?!""

The rep comes up with some answer but I can't hear it because I'm on mute laughing so hard that my leads pull the call to hear it. The rep gets off the phone and the guy says, ""I'm sorry for calling y'all. But can you believe this shit?! They're blaming y'all and costing me money and she tries to blow smoke up my ass while I'm running the test proving her stuff sucks!!""

I don't remember what I said or what happened afterwards other than me laughing for another 10 minutes.",Customer cursed out VoIP provider,0
"i work for a company which gives ipads to to remote users for logging information. we use a third party program to log this information. one of my responsibilities is to mediate the issues between our company's tech support issues and the ones caused by the third party program. in this story i will refer to myself as $Me, the third party support rep as $Rep, and his manager as $Manager.

this morning, i get a complaint from an employee that they are unable to save notes in a certain section. they seem to be doing everything right, so i open a ticket with the third party help desk and tell them about the issue, accompanied with a screenshot of exactly what i'm referring to. 

i get a pretty quick response. they call me directly instead of replying to the support ticket. we go through all the basic troubleshooting that i always make sure to do before hand. ipad is up to date, the software is up to date, and the ipad has been restarted. because of a language barrier i spent several minutes trying to explain to him that my client was not trying to delete a certain section of the notes, but rather they were unable to fill out notes in a certain section. i finally get $Rep to understand my issues and then the following conversation occurs. 

$Rep: everything is working fine from my end. i can save notes without any issues.

$Me: thats great, but my employee cannot do this. 

$Rep: (proceeds to explain step by step instructions on how to add notes)

$Me: the employee is aware of how to save notes, the issue is that after they try to save them, the notes disappear and do not populate in the final report. 

$Rep: im adding notes right now and it's working fine. 

$Me: again, thats great that you can, but why is my employee unable to do so?

$Rep: im not sure, my computer works just fine. could you have her go over this step by step on her computer while we are on the line?

$Me: your computer? our employees only use ipads (the company should be well aware of this. we are their biggest client and we submit support tickets quite often) besides, our employees work remotely and i communicate with them via email.

$Rep: let me forward this up to my manager

*on hold for several minutes*

$Manager: i hear your having issues with notes

$Me: yes, the notes will not populate in a certain section of the report. the employee can add notes to the report, but they disappear when the report is compiled.

$Manager: strange, i can populate notes in that section just fine.

$Me: thats great, $rep said he was able to do so as well, but this does not help my employee. why do you think they are having this issue?

$Manager: im not sure, could we have the employee sit at a computer and do this step by step over the phone?

$Me: No, our employees work remotely and they only use ipads. we cannot sit down with them, and we cannot use a computer. i already told $rep this. 

$Manager: i see, let me check with out ipad development team. (*puts me on hold for about a minute*) This is a known issue and we are working to resolve it.

"So I worked for this 3rd part MSP for a couple of months &amp; lord knows I can make a ton of posts about my time there (&amp; I probably will over time), but wanted to make my first post in this group not TOO long.

&amp;#x200B;

So as the MSP, my boss/owner ($CEO) decided that we need to be our client's go to people for anything with technology, including security camera installation and website design. He was smart enough to sub-contract that stuff out to people who specialize in that so we can focus on the computer/network aspect. Well one day, he decides that the next big thing we need to get the corner on it website marketing &amp; search engine optimization (SEO). This seems like a smart move, considering that we have company next door to us that we could sub-contract that out and have them refer their clients to us for their MSP work.

&amp;#x200B;

The only problem with this, $CEO doesn't feel that he could get what he would charge clients (after a mark-up for profit on our side) to make it work, so he decided that instead of paying a company whatever it was, he could just charge the client that, then have his technicians (all 2 of us) do it to keep us busy. We both objected, but he pushed back with ""well how hard can it be""? I responded, have you ever looked into it yourself? It's one thing to know the concept of SEO, but another to know how to make it work.

&amp;#x200B;

He kept bringing it up for about 2 weeks because he felt that anything you could do/view on a computer, then his technicians should be able to do without issue. Finally we both had enough &amp; said, well if you think it's so easy, why don't you look into it first &amp; get back to us once you're an SEO master that you think we should be. Never heard of it again.",Ordered to learn SEO,0

We've done this a couple of times before with this tech and it should have been simple enough. What floored me was when he stated ""I'm pretty sure all the ports have the same MAC address"" .

[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/c79szx/shamgars_low_budget_isp_4_larting_an_emptyheaded/)  
  
(previously on- I'm starting a low budget ISP with a disreputable businessman. I've just racked two servers in a student apartment with a T1 line. I'm running on a few hours' sleep, badly configured DNS and I'm on questionable drugs. Hit it)  
  
I make my way back from Will's colo/apartment without serious incident. Markus is nowhere to be found. I realize that I have a few things to do before I'm unfit for human company. I tutor freshmen and sophomores in intro Economics and I have two or three sessions scheduled for today.  
  
A few answering machine messages and I'm mostly good. I'm not having visual hallucinations yet, but I keep thinking the voices of people in the hallway or out on the street are talking to me.  
  
I ignore them for now. I've decided to avoid human contact and enjoy the ride. I grab my provisions and entertainment for the day:  
  
* A box of Golden Grahams cereal  
  
* A quart of convenience store iced tea  
  
* A VHS copy of Ralph Bakshi's Wizards  
  
I start to settle in my little room and let Avatar and Black Wolf's antics wash over me when I realize that I hadn't actually finished debugging DNS.  
  
I start my Mac, connect to the Internet and manage to log in to my two servers. I think I see what I did wrong in my BIND config files. A little tweaking, a restart of the server and I think I'm good.  
  
I keep getting distracted by the movie, so I eject the VHS tape and put another in at random.  
  
I run through the domains we bought. They're all bringing up the little animated 'under construction' animated gif. 
  
For a few minutes, I stare at the little stick figure guy digging. I wonder if he'll ever finish his task or take a break.   
  
I feel a little sad. I know he's just a gif, but I tap on the glass to check anyway.  
  
My phone rings. I stare at the flashing thing for a minute, hoping it will stop. The coherent part of me regrets buying the Unisonic 6900 clear phone with flashy lights, but it was only a few extra dollars.  
  
It stops ringing. 
  
It starts ringing again. The only way I can make it stop flashing is if I pick it up.  
  
I do.   
  
There's a voice on the other end of the phone. You know how George Orwell said ""by 50, everyone has the face they deserve"". This person has the voice they deserve. She's earned it by dividing the world into two categories- the people that shit on her and the people she shits on.  
  
me:""Hello?""   
  
Karen:""Is this LawTechie? Ivan told us that you'd make our site a priority""  
  
me (regretting that I picked up the phone):""Ok. Let me check my email to see what's going on""  
  
Karen:""We're a very important customer and we expect your full attention""  
  
I turn my monitor back on and start a browser. I don't want to engage Karen^2 in conversation while I wait for our Rube Goldberg linux box acting as a router and dialup controller to start shoving packets at me. I look at the TV screen and notice that I have bad taste in movies. I turn up the volume so I can hear the TV. 
  
Karen:""Did you hear me?""  
  
me:""Uh, hold on a second. I'm checking something""  
  
TV:""You are my agent. I am your case officer. I, in turn, report to your controller""  
  
Eudora (the best POP mail client ever written) finally opens my email. Ivan's been busy. He's managed to sell a website to our local tourist board for $100/month. I've got to set up email for a few of their employees and he's going to start on a website.  
  
Karen:""What's the hold up?""  
  
TV:""Say, Bill, do you think you could rub some of this bug powder on my lips?""  
  
me:""Ok. Ivan's working on the site. I'm going to set up your email addresses and set the passwords to, uhhh, bugpowder95. You should change them the first time you log in""  
  
Karen (sounding more annoyed than previously):""How am I expected to do that?""  
  
I stop and look at Peter Weller's stony face for a second and turn off the TV. I need to concentrate.  
  
Karen:""Well?""  
  
I Timbuktu into the mail server and start setting up Karen's domain and users. 
  
me:""It's going to take me a few minutes to get everything set up. I've set up your users. Next I'm going to set up your webserver.""  
  
Karen:""You said something about changing my password. Where do I put that?""  
  
me:""Hold on a second, one thing at a time""  
  
I start hearing a rustling on the phone. It takes me a second to realize that Karen is pawing through a bag of potato chips and eating them at me.  
  
Normally this would only be annoying, but combining my lack of sleep, Karen's existence and the chemicals in my brain, it's a maelstrom of awfulness. She's going to start gnawing on the phone and somehow yank me over the lines into her gaping maw like some joke creature in Dragon Magazine.  
  
Karen:""Chloorp. Karggh. Crunch. ""  
  
I look for something to make this stop. For a reason you can guess, I decide the best thing to do is to eat back at her to balance out things. I shove a handful of Golden Grahams in my mouth and start chewing. I can't hear her chewing any more.
  
DNS is set up and a stop/restart of the BIND server looks like we're working.  
  
For some dumb reason, I'm finding it hard to correctly type their domain, since there's a significant lag between my keyboard and the remote control software.   
  
Karen's getting impatient, but she's put the chips down for the moment. 
  
Karen:""What are you doing? How do I check my email?""  
  
We have a dull conversation about finding an appropriate POP client (Outlook Express) and where to put in dull information such as incoming and outgoing email servers on the four different PCs in their office. She picks up some other foodstuff that sounds more chewy/slurpy than crunchy for the username/password part of this drill.  
  
Three of the four systems go relatively easy and I only have to eat a few mouthfuls of Golden Grahams at her.  
  
The fourth takes longer. It's the furthest fromm Karen's desk, so she pulls the phone cradle as far as it can go, puts the handset on some hard surface and walks away from it to the fourth PC. This requires me to yell the user name and password several times at her.   
  
Karen:""What?""  
  
me:""BUGPOWDER 95!!!""  
  
Karen:""Where does that go""  
  
me:""In the box that says Password!""    
  
Karen:""What goes there?""  
  
me:""BUGPOWDER 95!!!""  
  
During all this, her phone is rocking on the table or desk it's sitting on, making an insectile clicking sound that I can hear. I'm imagining it turning into some giant precambrian lobster, waving its awful artificial limb colored claws at me. I look in my translucent phone to make sure it's not crawling through the lines and getting caught in the headset, like in Wrath of Khan.  
  
Karen either makes it work or gives up. I slowly disconnect the phone line from my phone and slide it out of my room.  
  
Markus is in the hallway and sees me, covered in Golden Grahams, flustered and sweaty.  
  
Markus:""What was all that racket?""  
  
me:""Tech Support""  
  
I decide to watch regular daytime TV in the living room with Markus. For the only time in my life, I find Delta Burke in Designing Women hilariously funny.   
  
Amazingly enough, we kept the tourist board, bringing on several hundred accounts over the next few months. Ivan paid me sporadically when I threatened him, but never complained when I ran my friend's web stores, band websites and PHPbb forums off of our servers.   
  
I remember getting the ""Tell us how you dealt with a difficult technical problem and how you solved it"" question at a job interview. I considered telling the Karen story but thought better of it and made up a more conventional story.",Shamgar starts a low rent ISP- I guess we're a business now... (conclusion),0
"This happened a couple years ago, but it is still on my mind. I was doing tech support for a software company. They had crappy cheap software and made money off their support service. The company was based in the United States and the users were working/doing business in the US but they had been born in a poor Asian country and their understanding of English was poor. 

You know when you call for tech support and get someone in Asia and how frustrating it gets? Now imagine the opposite happens all day long... Let’s just say I am very glad not to work there anymore. Anyway here is how that call went:

Customer: I want this client record removed from my program.

*Often they worded things poorly, we had to ask charting questions as part of our call*
T: Do you want to remove the transaction for this client or to remove the client record?

C: Yes, that.

T: Which one, the question presented two different scenarios. 

C: Client record. 

*I explained, in detail, that once removed there is no way to bring it back, including any transactions and information associated with the record.*

C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
*This often was a response that meant “I didn’t understand anything you just said but do what I told you to because I am paying you for it”*

I removed the record as requested

T: is there anything else I can help you with?

C: Yes, I need a receipt that shows I didn’t charge that record anything. 

*At this point I was about to lose it, but I have to remain professional*

T: If you went to a store and left without purchasing anything, does the store give you a receipt?

C: YES!!!

T: Okay, what would the receipt say?

"Over the July 4th holiday we had some pretty severe storms in my area. I have been on a very long, and much needed, staycation from work... which has absolutely nothing to do with the release of Shadow Bringers. Nothing to do with that at all. 

I was enjoying a nice cup of diet cola watching some epic cutscenes from the expansion when my phone rang. ""Ignore it Thelightningcount1. IF you ignore it, they will go away."" I go back to gaming when the phone rings 9 more times. 

I finally pick up. 

&gt; $Me - What?  
&gt; $Friend - Can you come help me out, I can make sure you get paid. My new computer in the new office is not working.

&gt; $Friend - Huh?  
&gt; $Me - Im on vacation and that is my fee.  
&gt; $FB - This is his manager. IF you are worth it, I will pay it. 

I drive out to his office and take a look at his PC. It will post, but will not move past that. 

&gt; $ME - May be the hard drive, going to open er up and take a look. 

I open up the case and immediately see the issue. Every cap is blown on the mobo. Every. Single. One. How this thing posted? No fuggin clue. 

&gt; $Me - Uhh... did you guys have any kind of power surge in the building recently?  
&gt; $FB - The building did receive a lightning strike. (No the irony is not lost on me.)  
&gt; $Friend - Nothing had power for most of the week.  
&gt; $ME - Did you not have a surge protector?  
&gt; $FB - See those strips along the floor, those are industrial power strips. I am told that they protect against power surges. 

The things he was pointing out were those long metal office power strips. The ones that have no, or very little, surge protection capability. 

&gt; $Me - Heh those are not surge protectors, merely... power... strips... 

I look at every single computer in the room slowly. 

&gt; $ME - *The exit is just to my left. I can just walk out right now. I can just walk out and never look back... $FB is sort of in my way, but he is scrawnier than me... I can just bowl him over. No one will ever know.* Try turning on all the PCs in this office please. *WHY!!!! WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?*

Of the nearly 200 computers in the office, 1 booted into windows. It was not plugged in at the time of the lightning strike. 

&gt; $FB - What do you suggest?  
&gt; $ME - You got warranty on these machines?  
&gt; $Friend - Wait what?  
&gt; $FB - The simple warranty. I will have to call dell to see if it covers power surges.  

After a short phone call $FB walks out of his office with no color in his face. 

&gt; $FB - The warranty we have does not cover power surges they said they can send out a tech and charge us for every computer that is damage.  
&gt; $ME - Do you have insurance?  
&gt; $FB - Yes.

I collected my 200 and walked out the door thinking it was over. 

Four days later. 

Phone rings and I am currently watching the MOST EPIC cutscene SE have ever done with one of their expansions as I go to fight Emet Selch. 

I ignore it and focus on the game as the most epic of fights followed the most epic of cutscenes. 

The phone rings as I finish up the story line. 

&gt; $FB - How much would you charge to rebuild all of the computers in this office?  
&gt; $Me - How many? *I should just hang up right now.*  
&gt; $FB - All but 1 of them.  
&gt; $Me - 50 bucks per machine. *There is no way he will say yes to that. Looks like you get to focus on titania extreme this weekend.*  
&gt; $FB - 25 per computer?  

I stop... Am I miscalculating how much money 50 per computer was? Answer was yes... yes I was. I dropped an entire zero on that number. That is a lot of money... but I also REALLY want to play this brand new expansion. 

&gt; $Me - 30  
&gt; $FB - Deal.     
&gt; $Me - *Dammit... I think.* OK I will be right over and get to work. 

I drive out there and see a TON of Dell boxes all over the place. 

&gt; $FB - The warranty guy wanted to charge 85 per computer, after the parts. So I just bought the parts and called you. 

I curse myself thinking I shouldn't have low balled it so hard. 

&gt; $ME - Ok. If I am going to do this, you are going to have to help me get everything organized. Each desk will have the parts needed for each PC next to it and I will get to work from there. 

Every PC needed a mobo and PSU replacement as well as half needing ran or processor replacements. Only 1 HDD was damaged and it was a storage drive, not the NVME SSD. 

I go down the line and remove the side panel from each machine, then remove the power cables from each machine, then unscrew the dead mobos from each machine, and you can see how this went. 

By the end of an 8-ish hour day I had most of the work done. Just needed to boot each machine up and pray. 

Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Only 2 DOA PSUs that came out. Was able to head to Micro Center and grab 2 cheapo PSUs using my own money. The guy said he would reimburse me for it separately. 

By nearly midnight I had all computers up and running and waiting for the logins. There was one thing I forced each new desk to have though. A high quality surge protector. 

I am handed the largest check I have ever seen in my life and walk out the door with a smile.

"First of all I'm not in support, but rather in software development so I usually don't deal with issues like that. Another thing is that our it has a list of email clients they support, but you are allowed to use anything you want, but then you are on your own if it breaks. Everything on the supported list sucks though.

Now this happened a few years ago. While I was slowly packing up my things to go home an executive I've never spoken to for more than a few minutes comes up to me and says that he has a problem with email syncing and the support won't help. I ask about it and feel bad for the guy, literally all he does all day is answer emails and IT is trying to force him to use a shit email client. He also lists what he's tried to do to fix the problem himself and it all seems extremely reasonable. He clearly is not computer illiterate. So I do some googling, stay in 30 minutes after my time ends and fix it.

Next day I had a 6 pack on my desk when I came in with a thank you note on it. A few weeks later I got an email from HR saying that due to executive decision I've received a raise for going above and beyond and to sign the updated contract.

This is why I think you should ignore policy when an important enough person asks to.",Know when to ignore the policy.,0
"When I started working for a local council IT support desk in 2005, we had Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for everything.  This was down to the Investors In People certification, but it made life easier for the rest of us.  Where it came to the service desk, we had to take the customer details and attempt to fix their issue.  This may have been anything from pointing them at our website to a maximum of a 1 hour fix. In 2009, I became the second in command of the service desk - mainly because I was the longest served technician and I was also the one who took on the more difficult customers.  In 2011, our manager quit and they intervieweded several people, settling for a guy we'll call Bob.

Bob spends a week learning the procedures and policies, then proceded to call a meeting with the entire team.  Also present was the head of IT, and Bob's immediate boss.  He told us that as there's 100 jobs in the Open queue, we need to work more efficiently.  A handout went around with new policies and although some of them were beneficial, most of them were either petty or nonsense.  2 in particular were total BS.  The early/late shift pattern was to be replaced with early (7:00-13:00)/day(9:00-17:00)/late (14:00-22:00) shift patterns, with the 7 members split 2/3/2 on the shift.  The new early and late shifts were to act as first line, taking calls and applying quick fixes.  We had 2 minutes to complete or hand off to the day shift - which was to say that we parked the call and waitied for Day shift to get around to it.

I had a few statistics I had collected regarding how the service desk operates.  I bring them up in the meeting and explain situations where the new policies would not work.  As you can imagine, I was over-ruled amd the new rules started the following day. Of all the new policies, the ""2 minutes per call"" rule was the worst. Not only did we have a mere 2 minutes to take a call, we had to attempt some troubleshooting and write up all the notes. If this was a new employee, we also had to add their details onto the system.

After a month, the department was in chaos. Because we could only work 2 minutes before handing it off to the day shift, there were a lot of calls for the three day shift workers to attempt to fix. The outstanding queue went from 100 calls to nearly 2000 in that month. The increase was partially helped by the fact that through a little malicious complaince, I maximised my time on every call. If I couldn't fix the call, I ensured that every call would take just under the 2 minute mark, then dumped them in the day shift call queue. Dropped calls (people who called and hung up) increased drastically, and one of the day shift team went on long-term sick due to stress.

Eventually the boss decided to come in early and see what the problem was. He sees me and another tech taking calls and stands over us while we work through the calls. We both take less than 2 minutes per call, and follow his rules to the letter. He has no reason to complain, but sees that the calls are dropping. With 2 people taking calls, 2 minutes per call and a peak of thirty calls around the 8:30AM time mean that lots of these calls drop then call back later.

Later in the shift, I see him checking call stats and see his face get red. He knows that his policy is not working.

The following day, Boss calls us all in to the meeting room and states that we must work harder or smarter. He tells us that we need to use the on-site support team to handle the logged calls instead of the day shift. We still had the 2 minute rule and the same staffing levels. I mentioned a couple of times that VIP's couldn't wait, and that we need 4 people taking calls from 8AM. I was told that the rules still stood.  We were also told that as several people had breached the 2 minute rule, any further breaches would start a disciplinary process.

The day after, we were told that on-site (desktop) support have no free slots for over a week, which is three times shorter than the dayshift's waiting times. Boss is in and instead of logging on to the phone to alleviate the pressure, he's simply floating around. As 8:30 rolls around, I answer yet another call - this was around my 30th of the day and there was 22 calls on hold waiting to be answered.  I answer with my usual organisational mandated greeting:

*Good morning, you're through to DPG on the IT Service desk.  Can I take your name or reference number please.*

Yes, it's a long greeting, but every customer facing call centre (there were something like 7 of them) had to use this greeting.  Then I hear the unmistakable voice of our Chief Executive.  According to even our new policies, he is given a greater priority.  He explains the problem - he's in a meeting room, 70 miles away attempting to turn on his laptop but he can't get past the encryption software. It's an easy fix, but takes ten minutes over the phone. I can't do it because of the 2 minute rule. I'm torn between dropping the calls or annoying the chief executive. Boss sees me hesitate and asks what's going on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** *Laptop encryption, he's in $distant\_town I...*

The boss shut me down

**Boss:** *Hand it off to on-site.*

I told him that they wouldn't be able to get out for over a week and that the dayshift could fix it, but this is stopping him from working.

**Boss:** *Dayshift is too busy, and you can't breach the 2 minutes.*

**Me:** *But it's ...*

**Boss:** *I don't care who it is, hand the call off, He told me before walking off.*

I took the details and apologised to the chief executive that I'd have to hand the call off. Made the notes on the call and gave the incident reference. After the calls slacked off, I printed the details of the call, ensured that the telephone call had been saved, and replayed it.  Although we had headsets, they actually picked up a fair amount of background noise.  Boss could clearly be heard giving me instructions.  I also printed a copy of the new SOPs and went for lunch.

I had just sat back down at my desk when I was called into the office of the head of IT. He chewed me out for leaving the Chief Executive without anything to present the council's vision of the future for $distant\_town. I was told that the Chief Executive wants someone's head (metaphorically) for the treatment, and that formal proceedings had started and I was to be suspended on full pay, and did I have anything to add?

I told the head of IT, that my boss had told me to do it, and when I started to explain about it, he walked away. I handed him the printed copies of the notes and told the Head of IT that if he pulled my phone log for that call, he could hear the boss shutting me down. Head of IT told me to stay where I was while he checked. An hour later, the Head of IT returned and apologised to me.  He told me that I could take the last hour off and return in the morning with no blemish on my record.

New boss was ""replaced"" (fired), and a new new boss was placed there, who had been promoted internally from a different team.  New new boss was well respected and had the reputation of actually listened to his staff.  We explained what had happened previously and he imediately tore up the new stupid rules and put us back to how it was.  The outstanding jobs queue took nearly a year to become manageable again.",There's always a bigger boss,0
"Not sure if this belongs here, but I guess the mods will take it down if not. 

Also, LTL, FTP, on mobile, yadda, yadda.

Background: I used to work in an outdoors store. The kind of store that sells clothing, equipment, and anything that can be used outdoors. If you live in the southern USA, you know this store.

It was another typical work day. Go in early to open as a Cashier, try to out on a happy face that shows I dont hate my job, leave, and come back in the next day. Again, typical for retail. However, during this all too ordinary day, we had someone try to apply for a credit card. So I called my lead, they headed over to another register to run their information, and that's where this story takes its turn. For some unknown, ungodly reason, the computer was inputting ""I"" and no matter how much you backspace, it would not stop. So being the tech savvy nerd that I am, offered to take a quick peek, in exchange for a snack (and to rid myself of people for 5 minutes). Lead agreed and let me do my ""wizardry"".

I know what you're thinking. It's a company register that rings out sales, what can you do to it? Well, without too much detail, Level 1 support. Power cycle? Nope? Replace keyboard? Nope. Check wires for damage? None. I was going to call it quits, but then a lightbulb went off. Something I should have known but just forgot in the heat of the moment. Like I said before, it was a register, but registers dont usually have a QWERTY keyboard, they have numbers and credit/debit buttons for....well transactions. Since this was also used for credit card applications, it had a QWERTY keyboard attached. Tracing the wire I found it leaned up against a stapler with was, as you guessed, on the ""I"". Move the stapler and all was fixed. Easiest snack win ever, and also looked like a genius.",The Ghost of Register 5,0
"When I worked IT for a school a while back I would typically be in the back room working on user laptops and processing them to our warranty provider to replace broken ones. There was one laptop left on the shelf for a while that no one wanted to send off. After a particularly slow day I decide to pop it open and see why no one wanted to touch this beast.

&amp;#x200B;

I have helped friends and family with IT and have seen many bad customer laptops. Nothing would prepare me for what I was about to see. The screen was bent at a 30 degree angle, the screen was cracked, the ports had brown gunk deeply embedded inside of them, and the keyboard was literally falling apart with the keys disintegrating. I gave the beast a quick wipe off just so I could clean it enough to send it off for warranty. To add insult to injury it turned the wipe multiple different colors. After sending the laptop off to warranty I still remember the beautiful work order we had received.

&amp;#x200B;

""Issue verified, system board replaced, keyboard replaced, top case+lcd replaced, bottom case replaced, keyboard replaced, battery replaced""

We did follow up with the user and asked him why his laptop was damaged so deeply but I never heard of what came out of that.",Abused Laptop from Hell,0
"I, again, work Enterprise fiber and we only have layer 2 switches (most times) on site for delivery at the demarc. 

A guy calls in and states that they are having network connectivity issues. I'm think, ""Ok, maybe packet loss or something along those lines.""

He says, ""We're having issues with some browsers loading slowly and some email taking too long to open in outlook.""

I'm irritated at this point but I'll look at it. This guy has 10 circuits on 4 sites!!

Me: ""Sir, which circuit is having the issue?""

Him: ""It's one of them. Don't you have notes on the circuit. ""

Me: ""Sir, you gave me an account number with 10 circuits on it.""

Him: ""You should still be able to find it. Let me go see what's in our equipment room.""

He gets the circuit ID and says, ""I found it. It's going to this device that's flashing red."" 

I log into the switch. Alarms are blaring for layer 1 issue on the handoff. I change the speed to auto negotiate from 100full. Link is down.

Me: ""Sir, your device is no longer connected to our equipment."" I'm not about to tell him that they're probably on a backup connection with someone else because he has no clue what he's looking for.

Him: ""Oh. Well, what can you do to resolve the issue?""

Me: ""Sir, I can't do anything because your equipment is, either, powered off or missing its configuration. You'll have to reach out to your internal IT department for help.""

Him: ""Well, what can you do aside from sending me to my IT department?""

Me: ""There's nothing I can do because the connection is physically down and we aren't managing that device.""

Him: ""There's got to be another resolution other than my IT department. ""

At this point, I'm thinking that he's done something that will get him in trouble.

Me: ""Sir, not even a tech will be able to help because our equipment is up. Your IT department needs to look at that device.""

He gets pissed and hangs up. Never found out what happened.",What else can you do?,0
