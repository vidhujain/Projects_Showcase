,Anyone here who has changed careers at his/her 40s? Thanks!,1
"Sorry in advance if this post is asking too much! I have a bachelors in public health and after college, I attended medical school but withdrew due to mental health and personal reasons. I’m 29 years old and have no responsibilities to take care of, but I’m 150k+ in debt due to not finishing medical school.

But I kinda regret withdrawing and LOVE the study of health, from public health to pathophysiology and pharmacology. I don’t think I can handle applying to Med school again as it’s an arduous process. I tried venturing into other healthcare professions like nursing, but I realize I don’t like the hands on nature if this profession. I struggle with technical tasks in using my hands, so I also don’t think a career in biomedical or physiology research will be suited for me?

Other careers I’ve explored include IT, school counseling, masters in public health. My heart though lies in healthcare, but I don’t like hands-on skills that is so necessary in fields such as PT, OT, Respiratory therapist, etc.

I guess my question is, is there a stable career out there for me where I can combine my love for learning health and interact with people in a non-hands-on way? Or should I continue to explore other career options? Is my debt a hindrance to pursuing certain careers?",Is there a career that exists and is suited for me?,1

I know a few, so I have a few lists of a question though to get some honest opinion. Below are some of the questions.

1. Which of this online school is considered a good choice? (Animation Mentor, Animschool, Animsquad, Ianimate)
2. I like to know the Pro &amp; Con for the animation career path if it any?
3. Do you think it is too late for me now to start my career in the Animation industry?
4. Will it be hard to find a job in this career? (I don't mind starting out as an entry-level job)
5. What is some major concern do I need to know if to start on this career?
6. I know this career could be a long hour with no overtime, stressful to meet a deadline, however, do you think with all that will it be rewarded afterward?
7. What is some other thing to worry about?

I also have another career path in mind and that is Computer Technician or anything IT same question as above. Please help me give me some honest advice and opinion so I can take it into consideration on what to go toward. Thank you.",Is it too late for me?,1

"**TL; DR: Copywriting isn't working out. I have two options: computer science (don't have a specific direction, feel a bit more comfortable doing it, worried the market's becoming too saturated to make it worth it) or physical therapy associates (this degree will keep me in Florida, which I hate, for the next four years).**   


Alright, long story that I'm going to try and condense because I don't have a lot of time to sit and write it all out.  


I'm a copywriter from South Africa who's lived in America for about 2 years. I've been in the industry for the last ten years, but since moving to the states, I've had more trouble than ever in my life just finding a job. I finally got one with an agency in Daytona but they're super sketchy and, for the last year and a half, I've been trying to get out. But, as someone still pretty new to the country and having my own REALLY intense schedule, networking and finding a job on anything other than job boards has been difficult. It's part of what makes me hate Florida so much right now.  


And, to be honest, I've started to feel pretty disillusioned with marketing. I feel like I've got tons of experience and a lot to offer and nothing's working. So, a couple of weeks ago, I started taking basics of HTML at a community college, and had plans to do the full computer studies course, which is two years and sets me up with, like, an A+ certificate, Java, C++ and a Ruby elective. So far the web stuff is going straight As, which I know doesn't mean much because it's easy. I don't necessarily know which direction I want to take it in, but I have tangential experience with it, and it's not a field that requires me to constantly market myself to everyone in order to get ANYthing (at least, not so much as marketing).   


But I am concerned that more people are getting into this every year, and I'm already hearing stories of people saying things like ""I've got my CS masters and I can't find a job)"". Once again, it's not as bad as copywriting, but I don't want to get into it and just be in the same place again within a few years. I want to go to school for as little time as possible and start working in an industry or field that will always have a space for me.  


On the other hand, my wife's been in a medical program for some time, now. I don't have the time to go through her whole nursing course, but we looked at physical therapy and it's a two year associates with a license at the end that will set me up for a great salary and lots of job opportunities, moving forward. But, because I work during the day, there's a great chance I won't have enough time to get all of the prereqs done before registration next year, which may mean us living in Florida for the next four years, total And we REALLY don't want that.

My order of priorities goes like this:

1. Make computer studies work (but is the market going to be anywhere near as reliable as if I went into medicine?)
2. Somehow make physical therapy work (but living in Florida until I'm 36 hurts)

I'd love to hear your opinions. There are some subtleties I left out because this is already so long, but clearly I'm confused and I just need some help. I wish copywriting could have worked, but I've been ice skating uphill since 2017 and I'm tired.",Need To Pick A Career Path. Can Anybody Give Me Some Advice?,1
"# I'm thinking of shifting career fields. How do I deal with the time differential of asking people like a boss to write recommendation letters for grad school (healthcare) if I won't be applying for a few years (after a lot of pre-requisites, gaining required patient care experience, studying for and taking exams in order to apply to school, etc.)?

"Hey guys,

I've been interviewing a range of people, including CEOs, startup founders, managers, etc. for my work-life balance blog, Balance the Grind.

I guess the inspiration for the blog was to push back against the Gary Vees of the world pushing 24/7 non-stop hustle, ""sleep when I die,"" non-stop grinding work ethic. I personally think it's a toxic and dangerous mentality.

The purpose of these interviews are to highlight how people from all walks of life, whether they're a CEO, freelancer, startup founder, can do their job successfully and still manage to spend quality time with their family, exercise, eat right, relax, and more.

Since May, we've interviewed over 200 people in a variety of roles, including: CEOs, startup founders, marketing managers, designers, freelance journalists, product managers, sales and more.

"Hello Everyone,

I hope this is the right place to post this. I'm looking for career advice so I suppose it is. I know many of you have probably felt the same way so I hope someone who was in a similar situation can offer some guidance. Here goes:

I'm 32, married, have a 2 year old son. Bought a new home a few years ago and have roughly $15k student debt, along with my mortgage. I have a bachelors degree in Economics from a major university with a minor in business. I also have roughly 2 years of classes towards a computer science degree (I'm including this because it's relevant to what I need advice on). 

After college I got a job as a Data Analyst, which I did for around 2 years and then the company was bought by another company and everyone was let go. I really enjoyed that job. I thought it would be my career and I would just slowly work my way up the ranks. I was young and naive, and got a brutal awakening to how the real world works sometimes. Since then I have been at a few different jobs. Currently I am working for a small transportation company (4 years) in which I wear many hats. I am basically the HR department, help with accounting/tax stuff, billing, and IT. I also help out with the actual transportation side of things if need be. For example, if the guy who does dispatch is sick or on vacation. The job is fine, and I make enough money to be able to allow my wife to stay home with my son, we recently bought a new home and vehicle so I can't really complain. The problem is that I feel very complacent, like i'm just wasting my time and skills. I come to work and go on auto-pilot. I definitely don't feel like I fit in at the company or in the industry either. It's a very crude environment and I have to deal with some of the most extreme personalities on a day to day basis. I'm not the most professional guy in the world, but there is basically zero professionalism across the board. It's like a high school locker room environment and i'm a freshman. I have to deal with harassment from employees, my boss, and even just people I have to talk to on the phone. Mainly because I don't know anything much about trucks or the transportation industry, and because I ""dress fancy and went to a fancy university"", (I will wear slacks and a button up most days). They all say I don't do anything, because I don't do physical labor or I don't drive a truck. They think computers are only for messing around. They always say I think i'm better than them, which isn't true at all. I have always believed you treat everyone the same, which I try to do. Also, because it's the transportation industry and I'm salaried I work a lot of hours including weekends and some evenings. I am basically on call 24/7.  I feel like i'm missing out on valuable time with my son/wife, and I don't feel appreciated at all. Now, I know that's basically the case for almost all jobs and for anyone who has a job. You are just going to miss out on time with family if you have to work, and i'm sure almost everyone feels unappreciated at their job, so maybe i'm just feeling sorry for myself. 

**Here's the main thing though**. My heart keeps drawing me to the tech industry. I really enjoy tech related jobs/tasks (IT, Data Analysis, Web development). I find them fun and interesting and often find myself spending my free time building pc's, doing basic programming, making websites or maintaining them (I created a website for the company I work for now, I also run a site for the local golf course). I keep finding myself applying for jobs in those fields, and I never get the job because I don't have any real experience or education. I would really like to break into the IT world, and I feel like when I read the bullet points on a job description for what the job requires that I can do most if not all of them, but I have no way to prove that to the employer other than my word. I have experience with Java, SQL, Linux, HTML, CSS, i'm very proficient with both the Windows and MAC operating systems. I have basic networking knowledge, I manage our local network at my company currently. I have built two computers, multiple websites, I have experience with remote desktop/remote services. I guess I don't need to go on too much about this part, because again it's just me saying I have this experience. I mainly just feel like if I were able to get a job in this industry that I could a) possibly make more money b) look forward to going to work everyday and maybe enjoy it c) be around people who are less toxic, or similar to me. 

My questions are these: Should I attempt to take some classes to get a degree? Or are there classes I can take online and self teach myself? Should I try to get some certifications online? If so, what would you recommend? Do you think I have a pretty good gig and should probably just stop whining? I'm terrified to take a big risk and fail and ruin what I currently have.

"Some background. I was offered a job that sounded amazing for a company (X) that has a great reputation. Unfortunately, in my excitement, I did not do my due diligence to see if the team was actually a good fit for me.

Within the first week, I realized it was a mistake. The company was great but for various reasons, the team was a bad fit. I felt that I had to try my best to make it work. After 4 months, it was obvious that it wasn't going to work out. I gave my notice and it was very awkward. But we all agreed that it was for the best.

The rest of my resume looks good &amp; I have references for other positions. But when I get call-backs from recruiters, they obviously ask why I left X after such a short time &amp; wanted to get a reference from them. I have no idea how to explain this without sounding foolish or impulsive (for not doing my due diligence). I haven't asked my ex-manager for a reference but I can't see her giving me a decent report because she was obviously annoyed.

What would you do?","Explaining ""red flag"" on resume - Need advice",1
"I’ve been let go before but I usually see it coming. I realize I’m maybe way over my head. I realize that maybe because I don’t enjoy the job I prob come off that way and put zero effort. There are times I see it coming because I admit I’m doing a shit job or honestly I realize the job is too much for me.


But this one I was excelling at. I loved it. It was a perfect fit for me. I was loving it so much I didn’t mind working overtime all the time. I only had a week to train for a job that takes two months to train for. It was a lot, but I rolled with it. Were there stumbles? Yes. But I am only 3 weeks in!! For a job I had 5 days of training for! That is a very in-depth manager position of an entire facility. I was doing good, and I feel like any normal boss would have noticed and appreciated it. Even my co workers and the person I replaced agreed. One of them called me a good luck charm in terms of business. The person I replaced said she was shocked. My ex boss is anal retentive and the first time we worked together for me personally was a nightmare. She seems like the type of person who judges too quickly, if you don’t pick up on something in two seconds you’re stupid, and no matter how good you do it will never be enough which makes me feel poorly because the two other people who work there do just fine with her. So obviously I’m just incredibly incompetent or something. Who knew...

I made two mistakes in front of her that honestly weren’t huge and it was legit my first week on the job. The few other mistakes I made were actually in front of the owners husband, and he isn’t even my boss and doesn’t do any hiring or firing and literally is the supply guy for the building. And handles building maintenance sometimes. And the mistakes were minimal. I could tell he was frustrated but I didn’t think it would cost me my job. Still don’t know if it did. I literally left some lights and a fan on one week into my position. And didn’t hear a toilet running when I was shutting down this huge facility and he got on to me about it. I also accidentally locked myself in a room (just went out the side door and walked back around front. That’s it.) but he made a big deal about it.


Today she sees me working my ass off after another week of kicking ass, comes into my office and says “I appreciate all you’ve done for us the past few weeks. I love your passion and creativity. You’re such a good person. Unfortunately it’s just not a good fit. I need someone with more experience.”

I’m in shock. And I sort of try ask for more clarity because even she told me I was walking into a landmine only having 5 days of training that usually requires ***2 months***

I asked if she thought had I had more training and More time to grow if she saw me getting where she apparently needs me to be “right now” and she said I have potential but no. Even though I pulled off everything she asked of me for 3 weeks either well, very well or at minimum “fair but needs improvement” because of lack of training.

I almost feel like maybe a coworker who she’s known for years said she didn’t like me. Her husband was visibly annoyed with me last time I saw him because of the little hiccups. He saw me working my ass off though as usual. 

I feel blindsided because I truly felt I was doing a good job.

I’m so depressed:( I feel like nothing I do is ever good enough. I’m not a genius and no I don’t pick up things like in a second, like some people are just experts and pick up new things very quickly. I’ve never been that person. Doesn’t mean I’m not intelligent. If I had another two weeks or even one I’m sure I would have been even better than I was this week. I was improving every week no doubt. 

She seemed MAD when firing me. But didn’t give any specifics on what the hell I managed to mess up so badly on that she had to FIRE ME and not have a meeting about it? The fact that she seemed angry made me believe there was more to what she gave me and it’s bothering me a lot. She said she really liked me as a person too so I’m overall confused. And sad.

"January 2nd I will have been at my company for two years. I started out as a Junior Systems Administrator. I was grateful for the position, because in my area these stepping stone positions are hard to come by in the IT field. They actually made the position for me when I interviewed for a Systems Administrator position with not enough experience. They liked me and offered me the Junior position so I could work my way up. I was replacing one admin, we'll call him Ross. They guy who was training me left a couple months after I started, we'll call him Kyle. After a few more months we hired a guy as a Senior Systems Engineer, Brian, with about 20 years experience.  
A little over a year into the job, I got promoted. My reviews were excellent and even said I was doing more and better work than Ross or Kyle. But the raise was basically just an early yearly raise. Because we go to the same gym, I talked to Kyle, and he started out making more than what I was now given, and he made less than Ross. I went to my supervisor and even up to the director, and they don't think it's fair, but HR has put their foot down saying I'm right in the middle of the pay range for my position and that's the most they can justify.  


Skip forward another few months to a couple days ago. I've been feeling like the Senior Sys Engineer, Brian, hasn't been doing much work. His projects sit there. I've even taken over and completed some of them, and he doesn't do much of the daily tasks. My supervisor talks to me privately to say that he has noticed the work I've been doing and that Brian hasn't been pulling his weight and I've been doing more and better work than him. He was able to get me a couple thousand $ more by moving me into the next company bonus tier. He said that the pay difference is very unfair, but that's the most he can do right now without HR getting in the way.

"I'm starting my career as a real estate agent and have been meeting with different brokers and checking out brokerages around the city where I live. I'm having a really hard time choosing a brokerage, and along the way I had an odd interview experience. Here are descriptions of the options I have so far:

&amp;#x200B;

1. First brokerage is a speciality, small, independent brokerage. The man who owns it is in his late 60's and he mostly does real estate investing and that's his niche but he also sells and rents here and there. He has two other guys working for him, one young agent around my age (23/24) and another who's about 45. I met them both and they were delightful, very friendly people. I live in the neighborhood where the company is located. The broker is a genuinely good guy, pure of the soul - he's one of those people who could easily and effortlessly get along with anyone. I felt really comfortable around him. They have a lot of rentals and sales on the market.

* Pros: Super friendly broker and agents, small brokerage, 70/30 split, printing, business cards, everything provided, no desk fees or any other fees besides MLS and other necessary memberships. He has a wealth of knowledge, knows everything about finances and real estate investing (which I want to get into in a few years), is going to mentor me, great reviews online, literally a 2 minute walk from my apartment. Prices for rent for them range from $2,000 to $4,000 and for sales it's $500,000-$2.5M. He guaranteed new agents who work for him make $50,000-$100,000 on average their first year. He was honest and said it may take a while, sometimes months (though unusual) for an agent to start earning money, but once the first client rolls in, it's a snowball effect going forward. He has numerous connections with people all over the city, and I met two of his investor friends who own a majority of properties in our neighborhood. There are leads but I'm responsible for marketing. He gave me really valuable advice on networking as well. We bonded over Barbara Corcoran and women in the real estate business, books and art, we spent nearly 4 hours talking. I could help him elevate his business with social media and changing up the outside of property, etc. I could see myself making a good name here and still earning a decent income without much internal competition, actually building relationships with people in the neighborhood I live in, and having a balanced work and personal life. The office is on the semi-casual side which I like, too.
* Cons: Although the broker is a genuinely good guy, he talks a mile a minute and I noticed he doesn't stay on topic for long. He talks *a lot.* I would ask a simple question and it would take forever, sometimes never, to get a detailed answer. Training is completely independent. There are no classes, nothing. It's all on your own. I would be able to shadow him for a while, he'll teach me how to write an offer and so forth. His real estate group has several subscriptions so he said it's mostly reading. I would need to work from my own computer which isn't a problem for me but did strike me as a little negative. The office is super small, two desks and one Apple desktop, though the space is clean, warm, inviting, and in an amazing location - I saw probably 50 people walk by and peek inside while we were talking. What struck me as a huge red flag was when he was describing a story to me and said how a seller told him someone at a big name company said the homes price was worth $580,000 and another agent from another company said $590,000 but he suggested $610,000. The seller wanted $605,000 and the property got an offer for $607,000. He said he accepted the offer right away before telling the seller (yikes) but the seller was thrilled. I don't know if this shows his expertise or lack of knowledge when it comes to pricing properly. Another red flag was he said you're not supposed do this, but he does anyways, which is when an owner says they only want females or males in the apartment, you only choose that requested sex to rent. I think it's because he's old so he doesn't care but that stood out to me as a negative. The agents who work there have also only been there for one year. He told me that's because it's such a small company that he only keeps it around to help out family, people he knows, etc when they're in real estate - he's never hired someone he didn't know before. He said he would hire me because I was the only person to ever cold call and that impressed him.
* Another bonus con: This is isn't a luxury brokerage, which is the industry of real estate I initially wanted to go into (now I'm more open minded about it; the neighborhood I live in is one of the most expensive in our state, and right now it's a picky buyers market so selling has become challenging even in the luxury world).

&amp;#x200B;

2. Second brokerage is an international luxury brokerage. There are five currently in my state and they're opening up another location next year. Extremely formal, serious work environment. Definitely feels corporate the second you walk in. They're selling a lifestyle, not just a home.

* There are around 70 agents, 12 of those are teams. The owners of this location are one of the teams. I had a great interview with one of the agents earlier this week. She was so sweet and we talked for about an hour until the wife, one of the owners, came in.
* I hate to sound like a millennial but here I go - you know when you can just tell that a ""vibe"" is off with someone? I got that right away with the owner. She was cold towards me, saw me in the morning when I walked in to meet the agent but didn't say a word. In the middle of my interview with the agent she walked in and shook my hand. She sat down and asked me right away where I worked before and if I had six months of expenses saved. I told her I met with several agents before getting my license and they all advised me to make sure I had six months saved, so yes, and told her my work experience. She replied, ""We don't sell homes, we sell a lifestyle. Clients can smell desperation."" This came out sounding very passive aggressive. She said she sold over $30 million this past year and asked me what I want out of real estate. I said I was looking to build a reputable, serious, life-long career in an industry where there's constant opportunity for growth. I didn't experience that in my first job and knew I wanted more out of life than that. She made a comment about how I look 16 (I'm 23, petite/athletic build). I noticed there's no diversity at this office, everyone is white, which there's nothing wrong with that but I grew up in an extremely diverse town and went to school where 60% of the student population was international. I'm Latin American, so I was drawn to this company because of their international base but their agents don't reflect that. She asked me how old I was and then automatically said, ""Oh, I'm not supposed to ask that -"" and I said, ""No worries, I'm 23."" She said, ""Yeah, I often say and do things I'm not supposed to."" She said real estate is a tough business, etc, and said, ""It's not about looking good and wearing high heeled shoes."" I felt like this was condescending because I put in the effort to look nice and professional for this interview and I was wearing block-heel styled shoes, less than three inches in height lol.
* She asked me some other things but I said flat out that I'm looking for a strong training program and that I want to shadow a top producer. She said their company doesn't offer shadowing and the company doesn't hire new agents, but it just so happens that a woman on her team is pregnant and is going to leave in January. She said she would talk to her team but asked if I wanted to step in and be an extra set of hands. I would go to showings, listings, see how an offer is made, etc, basically shadow her, her husband, and another team member while the other team member is out. There's only one other team member who's ever shadowed like this before, and it was actually the woman who's currently pregnant. She was in the office and was the first person I met when I walked in the agency. She came into the room and she was really sweet, but I could tell the owner was nice and friendly with the two women but with me she was hard-edged. She said I would be paid for the few months of work while that pregnant woman was out but that there's no guarantee I would end up on a team. She added, however, that lots of people would love me and would probably fight to have me on their team. In my head I was confused and felt slightly gaslighted given her snide comments earlier and demeanor. She said she and no one on her team would ask me to do something they wouldn't do themselves while shadowing. This includes making the beds, planting flowers in the front yard, doing anything that needs to be done basically. She said everyone works A LOT, I should expect 10-15 hour days Monday through Sunday and be available any time after work from mid-December to late March. She also asked me what neighborhood I live in, if I live alone, if I pay rent or own my own place. I thought those were inappropriate questions but answered politely.
* Right after this owner walked out the agent who originally interviewed me asked to see me again tomorrow so I could meet the other owner. I agreed and showed up. This time it was just him and the original agent. This man told me they would pay me $1,000 per month (that's way less than minimum wage in my state) for those months I would shadow. I told him his wife the day prior told me there would be no guarantee to join a team afterwards and I didn't want to waste their time or mine, so if that was the offer I wasn't taking it. He said his wife was impressed by me and thinks I would be a good fit. He said he would let me shadow him, he would personally train me, he would create a business plan with me, and I would be guaranteed to join a team after the few months are up. I said I would think about it and give him a final answer next week.
* Pros: Luxury international brand, reputable and respectable brand, thousands and thousands of listings in the city and beyond, opportunity to make a really high income, will get paid to shadow and there's in-house training with the top producers twice a week, their rentals are $10,000+ and sales begin at $800,000 with the average being in the $5-15M range. This brokerage has all positive reviews.
* Cons: I don't know the commission splits because the conversations moved quickly and the agent I was interviewing with had to leave early both times to teach a training session. I don't know what they'll cover, although I do know headshots, business cards, pamphlets, etc are provided. I felt extremely uncomfortable with the way the owner treated me. If she makes my life a living hell and smears my name and potential reputation as an agent, it doesn't matter that I'm in the company already, no one will add me to their team since she's the one who calls the shots/has the most influence. The offer she gave me and her husband gave me are completely different. To be honest I felt insulted by the $1,000 per month when this company ranks in multi-millions a year.
* Bonus con: Every single person who works at this place was already wealthy before they joined. They don't need this job, none of them used it as a stepping stone in their life to shift from one class to another. They could sell one home a year and it wouldn't matter. There's only one young person in the entire office who's 25. This company never takes new agents and they only hire internally people who have experience. They said they hired her because ""she's different"" - she purchased a home from them when she was 21. I'm genuinely concerned that if hired these people are going to treat me like a charity case and use me to the point it's going to essentially force me out of the business from how miserable the experience will be. They know I don't come from high society/wealth hence the first questions this owner asked me: where I was raised, where my parents were raised, where I live now, if I have roommates or not, if I rent or own property(-ies). I left both meetings feeling down and less than, disrespected and looked at as an idiot who's desperate for anything and would be grateful to just sit at an open house with a measly (to them) $5M price tag. My instincts usually never fail me. In my first career I met with a friendly woman from the company but I could just tell something was off. Once I started working I met the boss above her and I got the exact same feeling with this owner that I had with my previous boss (toxic, passive aggressive, gaslighter, insecure/wants to make young people's lives miserable, etc). There's a difference between being a luxury company owner and seeing a young person full of ambition, and saying, ""I'm so sorry but we don't hire outside of the company. I appreciate your time, take care"" or admiring a young person trying to improve their life and working hard, and welcoming them onto the team. But to go out of your way to make rude/diminishing comments to someone just starting out and then dangle a carrot in front of them? Something is not right there.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Third brokerage is known very well within the country. About 30 agents at this location, the only one in our city. Super clean and open office, mostly young people. I met with the CEO and he was just... neutral. Answered some questions I had but didn't engage much in conversation. He said there's web training online but you learn by going out into the field. He said you learn from other agents. If you want to shadow, you have to ask one of them to take you out. This struck me as so off-putting because if these same people are your competition, that's never going to happen. They're always going to be too busy and they likely actually are. He seemed very nonchalant/didn't care - it's every man for himself at this place basically.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to meet a few more companies in the next week but so far the first option seems like the best fit for me. My biggest concern is getting business and I can forget about the luxury market if I start there. Maybe I'm wrong about that though, I've never worked in the real estate business before.

"Hey everyone. Is there such a thing as an 'agent' for normal jobs? For example, if you're a good repairman, or a good coder, or cook or martial arts teacher or whatever. Is there someone who can line up opportunities for you, the same way a Hollywood talent agent could line up opportunities for an actor? I don't mean someone finding a 9-5 job per se, because that would likely just be a recruiter; recruiters tend to represent companies, not 'talent' or potential employees. I mean more like someone marketing you and your skill set in pursuit of a variety of opportunities that suit your strengths specifically. 

To illustrate, lets say I am a great designer and I want to teach a class in it. But I am terrible at pitching. Is there a 'representative' who could contact local schools or community centers to pitch it on my behalf? Or someone who could negotiate salaries on a secretary's behalf?  Or someone who could find opportunities for a someone looking to branch out? I imagine there must be something like this, but I am blanking.

"Fifty years old. Changed careers at 40 with the goal of career and income growth. Went into debt to finish my Bachelors in 2011. Income retreated below pre-career change levels while expenses grew (family expansion/transition to single income household). Recent promotion and income growth, but not to what I expected 10 years ago when I made this move.

Still in an industry I happened into 25 years ago. Bored and uninspired in this industry. 

The main bright spot of it all is that I have built pretty robust technical skills for innovating and automating through software and development. It started about 6 years ago when I discovered how to make Excel do the heavy lifting using VBA. I’m not talking about recording macros. I’m talking writing code using common programming concepts.

This birthed a passion in me to learn web development and web app development (think CRUD - Example: order entry system with user authentication). I also use Python to work with Excel files and data.

Clearly, I’m interested more in solving technical and business challenges through technology more that the day to day operations of a given business or my own boring industry.

I will say, as a manager of a team, I enjoy coaching people - which typically revolves around how to think about and analyze data, and innovation. I also enjoy building strategic relationships because that has a twofold sense of accomplishment for me: I can provide value to others and I feel like it’s always and opportunity to learn something new about and from others.

I can program database apps using both MySQL or MongoDB with the Node/Express stack, but I don’t get the chance to do it everyday. I have been doing this when I’ve had time for 2-3 years now.

I’ve also freelanced in the side for businesses providing solutions in Excel and Access. I love doing that but the downside is it’s an evening/weekend gig when I do have clients and it doesn’t scale.

"  

Hey guys I need some help with a problem.

I feel so bad about how I’ve behaved ever since I left high school. I finished in 2015. I was the fucking star student, frequently number one. But I joked with my life and education after high school. This was partly because I was fixed on my dream of one day playing pro basketball. I was not even thinking about going to university like everyone else. The only thing I was thinking of was playing basketball and how I could join the NBA one day. 

With the work I was putting in (or not putting in) and at my age, I wonder how I possibly thought I could get there. I mean, I had zero structure or discipline. I was playing FIFA with my cousin till 2 am and waking up at noon. I hardly had any structure to my training: going to the gym irregularly without any goal, playing pick up at a local court (and thinking this was enough training). 

In high school, I only thought of two possible careers: Medicine or pro basketball. Naturally, I applied for the former. I got accepted and was to join in 2016. However, I was not so excited about this. My mind was still on basketball. I felt I could still make it to the NBA if I just tried harder. 

September 2016 came and I joined Med school. But reluctantly as I still wished to be playing basketball. All along my plan was: “Okay, I need to keep on training (the fake training I spoke of earlier with nowhere near the intensity or structure needed to even make a high school team in USA) so I can become good enough. Then I’ll do SAT’s, join a college abroad and join their basketball team.” It sounded great in my head, but the odds were infinitely stacked against me. Especially with no support (understandably) from my family, it would be very hard for my dream to come true.

So anyway, the short of it was I joked with Med school coz I did not really want to be there. I came late for classes, did not do my 1st sem exams and was generally withdrawn. I was just thinking; “I’m going to join the NBA so why am I wasting my time here. After 4 months I left, planning to continue training for basketball and working out. I did just that, but the pressure kept on mounting.

My parents kept on asking me what I wanted to do. I did not want to say, “All I really want to do is play basketball.” I felt like they would (as they previously had) not support that at all. I also did not want to be embarrassed if I failed. While I was still in medical school, my mother suggested that I apply to law school as it is “general”. So when asked that fateful question and feeling like I had actually messed up by playing with med school, I simply responded “ I want to do Law”. This would appease my parents, but I never really wanted to Law either.

Reluctantly, I applied to and got accepted into Law at Strathmore University. 

All the while I was thinking: “Man I shouldn’t be here!” I kinda felt forced to be there by my Dad (the day before I was to join he gave me a talk which basically ended in “You WILL go tomorrow”.) I figured: IF only I could make some money then I could be free to do whatever I please. I started looking for any and every way to make cash. That’s when I stumbled upon Forex trading and got obsessed. Long story short, it flopped. Around Dec 2018, a year and a half into my trading journey, I realized I would need to have more stability and not rely on trading to make a living. I quit

Now I am two years through my degree. My grades are average ( C ). I have missed the whole first sem of my third year because I seriously did not plan to come back after that 2nd year. I had planned to transfer to do Financial Engineering (this was because of my tango with Forex; I thought my interest in markets meant I should do a degree in Finance) but after attending 2 classes I felt like this was a mistake. 

There I was, the only 21-year-old in a class of 18 year old's (now that I write it down the age difference does not seem big at all). But I felt so bad and alone. I left and tried to go back to Law school. I had missed a week of the 1st semester and so I was rather lost. I was not attending classes seriously and that’s when I decided I needed a break. I applied for Academic Leave and it was approved. Now I feel like that was a big mistake. I feel like I should have just graduated with this degree and went on to study something else I liked at Master’s level or get a 2nd degree. 

Anyway, here I am now trying to get back into the 2nd sem and figure out how I can finish this degree. I am set to graduate in 2022 while my peers from high school graduate next year. 

Should I switch to another degree or try and see this one through. My main option is to drop this one right now and go to SA for my degree. I was thinking CS and Math, Electrical Eng or Business. Do you think it’s a good idea to go abroad for an undergrad? Should I just slog through and get this degree even if my grades are poor and I don’t really care for the Law?",Help!!!,1

"Hello everyone, I was recently chosen by my graduate university to participate in a job shadowing event at Google which is only supposed to last about 2 hours. I was told to bring 2 copies fo my resume, get business cards from managers and others at the event, and wear business attire.

A few questions I have regarding the overall event:

1. Does anyone have experience with a Job Shadow event at Google and if so, could you possibly provide a general outline of event?

2. What is the appropriate way to hand someone at Google a resume? What I mean is what would be a natural conversation to strike up in order to present my resume to a hiring manager?

3. I would not want to over dress but certainly would not want to give off a careless look. How would khakis, a plaid shirt, and brown boots look at a Job Shadowing event? Would it be too laid back? A surefire backup is professional business attire but again, I would not want to be over dressed for such an event.

4. Not my most important question but certainly one I am looking forward to the most, how many people have experienced a successful employment opportunity from a Job Shadowing event such as the one held by Google.

If you have read this far I appreciate your time and value your opinion whatever it may be!

"A friend of mine recommended Insight Global (a recruiting agency) to me earlier this year after she was able to find a job at Salesforce through it. It's been a goal of mine to work at Salesforce for a long time, but I know it's difficult to get in there.

So, I connected with Insight Global and they brought a job opportunity to me recently. It's not with Salesforce, but another big company in my city and I'm interested. The pay is a lot more than I'm currently making (it would be a 20% raise). However, I'm really unsure about the contract-to-hire aspect. I currently have a job I like, I'm just looking for something more challenging with higher pay.

After doing some reading online, it looks like companies agree to a certain pay with Insight Global, then they keep a percentage of that pay and give the rest to the contract employee. It seems like they take a pretty big chunk of the pay, so now I'm realizing this company would actually be willing to pay someone in this role a lot more. Plus, with permanent hire status not guaranteed, I'm not sure I want to take this risk, even though it's seems like a good opportunity from the outside.

Has anyone worked with Insight Global or something similar? Is it worth it? The reviews online are mixed, and to be frank, I feel like I could find a job on my own and not have to split the income with anyone else.

"Hi all, I'm not part of this Subreddit but this is a question I've had for a while.

I've wanted to live in Europe for years now, but I know that's not something that's easy to accomplish. Here's a little bit of information about me:

* American
* 20 years old (21 in November)
* Junior at university working on a bachelor's degree in Geography with a minor in Tourism
* Was an exchange student in Oslo (Norway) and I worked at a hotel as well in Oslo for a few months; I lived in the country for almost 8 months and have several friends there

I just love Europe; my family has strong European heritage; I'm descended from several places in Western Europe (UK, Germany, France) and Eastern Europe (Croatia, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary) and I just love the European lifestyle. My question is, how can I manage to find a job in Europe to be able to live there? I do speak relatively good Norwegian (been learning it for years; took a class when I was an exchange student in Norway and English was not used at all) and that's my ultimate goal, but I think the UK would be best as there's no language barrier when it comes to that... Is it easiest to get a job at an international American company that has offices in Europe? Or should I just keep applying to British companies? I am aware that I'd need several years of experience to get there; I don't expect to just move to Europe once I graduate... It's going to take time. I know tourism is a huge industry and I'm always trying to stay positive, but it's always in the back of my mind that I'll never get to go to Europe as anybody other than just a simple tourist. I just can't see myself living in the US. I'm more of a socialist and prefer socialist societies (I lived in Norway; I didn't want to leave and the only reason I did was because my residency permit of 8 months ran out so it would've been illegal to stay any longer). Luckily I'm doing well with college as I know most European countries only give out working visas to skilled workers, but I've been thinking of doing a masters program but I wouldn't do it in the US as the prices are ridiculous. Does anybody have any advice about how I can go about hopefully moving to Europe? I'm not afraid of hard work if I know it will pay off in the end; I'm still learning Norwegian and I have consistent contact with my friends because I really want to live there... But I'm afraid I have to rely on luck for me to reach this goal... Anywhere in Europe is fine with me. I'm obsessed with the history and architecture... I could go on for hours about the castles of Germany and Switzerland, the Black Plague, the Vikings... I know what I want in life, just don't know how I can get there.

I holding this new position for 2 months now which I am evaluating should I change or how should I proceed further. Current position is a senior position and what I have been told at the interview is not what I am performing daily. In addition to this my reporting manager does micro management and constantly over my shoulder. I found out that there is a new position opening up in my neighboring department and I would be perfect fit for it. I am sure that I am perfect fit because it is more senior technical management position whereas current position is more of a management position. My manager and myself both are in same role, but just that I report to my manager in reporting hierarchy. Is it right to talk about me being perfect fit for new position just joined in this company for 2 months. If I want to talk should I talk to new manager, or next two levels in hierarchy (i.e) Director &amp; VP. I am saying VP because the new role ended up being role up to VP from downward.

Also, meanwhile I am thinking should reach my previous employer to talk about joining back. I left them for pay and not compatible work culture. When I leaving my previous employer they wanted to negotiate with me but I am was not open to negotiation because all this new job hype. But I do have good relationship with my manager and seniors. I have build trust up till CTO with my previous employer and I am top performer for them.

What haunting me everyday is that me being very unproductive in the current new role?

What should I do?

1. How should I tell my manager that I do not liked to be micromanaged in a very diplomatic way.
2. Should I talk about me being fit for this new position ? If I should talk, should I talk to my manger or director or VP?
3. Should I reach out to my previous employer? or stay away from them for now?
4. Should I start searching new job? ( Which would take months to get a new job with pay scale I am in )

"In short, I've been very unhappy with how the company I work for has been run over the last 6 months. It's a very small company (20 employees in the office and then a few more abroad too). 

I was criticised for a few things I thought were completely unfair but I remained professional and apologised despite me not thinking it was my fault. Deep down this really wound me up but I didn't complain. In hindsight I probably should've had more of a backbone and been a bit firmer and standing up for myself while still being professional.

Anyway I just had my yearly 'review'. I was annoyed at how this was conducted... I finish work at 5pm and just as I leave my boss wanted to have a word (which was the review).
1) I didn't know I was having this review. It wasn't scheduled or anything.
2) It could've been done during my working hours and at least given me some notice to prepare etc
3) The ""review"" lasted less than a minute. I was expecting this to be a little more formal and a chance for us to discuss my performance

Instead the review consisted of him saying ""there were a few mistakes you made which we spoke about before and therefore I'd like to offer you more money however I can't and am going to give you a 1.55% pay rise"". 

This isn't actually a pay rise because inflation is closer to 2% so when you factor in the country becoming more expensive, I've actually had a pay decrease. On top of that it failed to take note of my bonus.

I went home that evening very angry and sent my boss an email saying ""Hi, I'd like to discuss with you first thing tomorrow morning the review we had at the end of the day today"". 

The following day I was very stern and honest about how I wasn't happy with how the company has been ran and how I've been treated. I basically said you've not given me the foundations to show you my potential and I was also disgusted how the review wasn't a review. It lasted less than a minute, I didn't have a chance to discuss how I felt and that the salary was given to me without my chance to discuss if I think it was fair. I also said I typed up some notes of how I honesty felt things have gone. 

As an introvert who rarely shows his emotions or opens up honestly like that I think my boss was a bit taken back. His hands were shaking a bit! I saw red inside but remained calm and collected when being brutally honest.

Anyway I said I'd give him these notes once I've typed them up fully. I've written them now but I wanted to ask for feedback before I send it. When I wrote it, emotions were running high so it has the potential to get me sacked. 

In summary the things I was annoyed about were:
1) how the review was conducted
2) mistakes they felt I made which I disagreed with
3) how I was ignored by management after these mistakes. They wouldn't give me work etc so how can I prove myself when they'd blank me?
4) I was accused of not working closely with them but when im ignored by them how am I meant to work closely? 

The letter is quite long. I wrote it as bullet points but since I felt quite strongly I ended up turning them into long paragraphs with examples and the document became long.

I'd like the outcome to be:
- improve my relationship with management 
- a salary that's at least the same as what I was currently getting paid (if not more). Or at the very least to give my bonus back - you want me to prove myself yet taking away an external incentive. Having said that I am motivated internally when I feel valued/respected which I don't at the company.

BTW I'm not looking for career nirvana - just a role that allows me to grow and get on.  I am 41 and being paid less than what many 20-somethings are on because I've effectively ended up in a junior IT position again.",Back to Accountancy?,1

I am posting here seeking some guidance about a situation I have at my work. Both of these jobs are at the same company but vastly different areas (IT vs Bid Coordinator). I have a mortgage, wife, and 4 kids from 5 y/o to newborn (october baby!). These are my caveats but insurance would remain since it is same company. Apologies for long post, but a TL:DR is at the bottom. Feel free to ask any additional questions, I tried to lay out as much information as possible.

I currently work in the IT department in the call center / service desk and have an associates in Network Support. I have been with this company for about 7 years. The Job is ok. The pay is ok/decent. I have been told that I would be progressing from level 2 to a level 3 analyst. During my review time it was told to me that it has more requirements placed on that position, specifically time. I qualify for it with the exception of time at the company. I also was told that I had needed to step up from my managers supervisor (VP) even though my manager has seen that I take on projects, lead projects, assist / lead team and basically get things done (Everything). She was just as confused but had no room to move with it.

Currently in my position and area (IT as whole), our VP decided that there was some restructuring going on, and I was (along with a few others) were asked to bring up % of time doing what tasks we were doing along with what administrative tasks that we are doing.

I was approached from a division personnel ( I work on the corporate side ) that there might be a job opening in there area. They stated to me that this position depending on how things worked out if I were to get it, could progress from a bid coordinator / paper pusher into an estimator and possibly more.. which is nothing of what I went to school for. I feel like I could be underqualified but I do love to learn, and figure things out (hence IT). I feel that since I was approached that I could fit this and do well in that field. 

I do not know the finer details of this other position, but I am seeking advice as to if I should pursue this opportunity or not? My fear is that it would impact my job today if I go for it and do not get the position, that it would prevent future growth with the company in the IT area. I am not actively trying to get out of IT, but its disheartening when I get told that I will not be getting a promotion even though my manager agrees I should be. I may get it this year, or I may not... yet to be determined.

Should I go for this other position or hang out and see how things pan out in current position.

TL:DR

Got another opportunity in company I work for, in an area I may not be qualified for but would have training. Concerned with impact of current position growth  should I not get it, and how it might affect my family and I going forward. Should I go for this other position?

"Last Friday, I received an official offer from my dream job (September 20). To make a long story short, they told me that my start date would be October 7. However, I suggested October 14 so that I can have enough time to properly close out some significant projects at my current job. On that same call, I also informed them that I have a vacation (already planned) from October 22 - October 28. They were very accepting and sent me an offer letter with the October 14 date.

The conflict I'm facing is more internal. I'm usually never the type to take vacations, and this vacation was planned with the assumption that I'd still be at my current job (fun fact: I have the most accrued vacation hours at my current job, lol). Anyway, for this to be my dream job that I received an offer from along with my request to move the start date AND inform them about my week-long vacation the week after, I feel very uneasy and conflicted about.

"If you live in North America you've probably heard about the account scandal that happened about 5 years ago.

Well, I was one of those people who was let go. (I know what you're thinking and I wasn't greasy like the others, it was 2 act's for a g/f who never funded them, I never earned commission income for the accts or during my time at WF)

I got lucky in a sense in that I was able to reinvent myself quickly in Fintech sales making better money about a month after being let go.

What can/should I do? Keep WF on my res and own what happened when I have to talk about it on my res?

I'm from the school of thought that I should show some balls and own it for what it is however I'm also a realist and when I took that approach after first losing my job there years ago I was commended by the interviewer for my honest and never called contacted again.

"About 1 year and a half years ago, I applied to this company, right after graduating from university. I was excited about the role, and I actually turned down another job offer at another company for this one (I’m still kicking myself for this). When I got hired, they hired me as an Data Analyst, which is even stated in the contract. The first day I got here, my manager told me how they had just lost one of their administrator coordinator, and that I was going to do analysts stuff, but they also wanted me to also help with the coordinator stuff. Back then, I didn’t really understand the difference, and said “sure, I don’t mind helping out.” Before I knew it, I was completely taking over that role, and months go by. I didn’t do much with the role that I was first hired to do. I see other analyst actually working, and doing work I know I can do, but they aren’t giving me. I talked to them about this, and told them I wanted to do more Data Analyst work, and they said they understood and they would get me more involved. They did, so I decided to remain at this company, but only about 45% of the work I do is Analyst work. THEN, the secretary goes on a 2 month leave (or so they tell me) and they ask me (more like told me) to “help out” doing her work since the coordinator work related to her work. 2 months past, and she’s still not back, and now it’s been 5 months of me doing her work. Most of my time I do work that related with invoicing, checking hours, making sure contracts get renewed — essentially doing full time secretary work for this company. I want to quit and get a new job, but I’m nervous about putting in my resume that I worked as “Data Analyst” (what’s in the contract, and did about 45% of the time, less now with the secretary gone) when I didn’t do much of that role. I’m so utterly bored at work. I feel like I got lied about this role. The reason why I haven’t flat out quit is because I need the money, I have a huge school debt to pay off. It’s been 1 year and a half, and I’m nervous about not being able to find another job (in my field) because of what I did in this company.

"Of course I knew that combine work and studying won’t be easy task, but I even can’t imagine that it would be so hard! So after a year I have several tips for you to make your life easier:

1. **Plan your day.** You should know exactly at what time and where you need to be. Prepare your projects in advance when you have some free time; when you know dates of your exams or tests you need to discuss your days off with worker as earlier as possible. Be sure this will help you to avoid unnecessary problems.

2.  **Don’t be afraid to ask for help**. You’re a student, you don’t have a lot of experience and skills. So you just waste your time when try to understand something by yourself, it’s much better to ask your colleagues to help. By the way, they can advise how to communicate in the right way with your boss.

3. **Forget about studying at work, and at work - about studying.**

   You shouldn’t be nervous about your work and try to conduct business negotiations in a 10-minute shift. It is not worth working out at work for learning problems. Everything has its place and its time.

I really hope that my tips will help you to find balance in your student life.

A few months ago I had to start paying back my student loans. I’m at a point where I’m struggling financially because my pay is low and I can’t work full time here yet

"**tldr; I'm putting my company newsletter on hiatus because I'm facing health issues, should I mention that my health is the reason for the hiatus in the farewell article?**

22F-I work for an engineering firm part-time in human resources. I also have a chronic illness that frequently causes me to need to work from home, or leave work to go to appointments.

I voluntarily work on our monthly company newsletter as an editor, I work with two other employees, but I'm the one who makes the layout for the newsletter on publisher and puts all of the articles in place, and I write at least one of the articles every month.

My health has recently been a huge issue, because I've started having seizures, and my vascular condition is causing me to be unable to even sit up out of bed sometimes. Because of this I've been out of work sick and unable to even do any work from home.

"M22 - Currently working in Pensions Sector. I didn’t go to Uni, joined the sector as a trainee and completed industry qualifications.

My current salary is £27.5k (i.e. £30k ish including bonus). Spend less than 30% of my time on the phone to clients giving guidance and the remainder of my time is spent doing pension calculations.

A job has come up in my field in a private sector company (applications close tonight) and it’s offering up to £30k. No flexibility in working (straight 9-5, no homeworking) and there is a bonus scheme but it’s shaky (i.e. staff have publicly criticised receiving 0% in the media). This is literally a telephone-based role - like 100% of your time giving advice. I’m naturally a bit of an introvert so this makes me a little anxious but the prospects are much greater - way more scope for progression.

Where I’m working right now, there is no scope for progression (such a small team) and I couldn’t see my earnings reaching above £30k (excluding bonus) within the next 3-4 years even. There seems to be a public sector mentality where complacency is acceptable, but I have received recognition at work for exceeding expectations. 

I just worry about risking my current job (£27.5k, massive flexibility and a lot of my time at home in peace) for a potential pay cut and possibly more stressful (being on the phone all day) - but I’m sure the earnings/career prospects are better if I can get past that.

The alternative is waiting and applying next year (they seem to recruit every August/September) when I’m more confident, but that means maybe missing out on a year’s progression at the other company.

"I'm currently working as trainee in one of the leading semiconductor company.. into my 7th month now.

I have a masters degree but i'm currently struggling to finish my assigned job/deliverables to my stakeholders..

First 6 month was torture. There was minimal support given to me from the team due to multiple projects coming in. My mentor is non-existent. It was assigned to her to show me the ropes, but it never happened. I have to work in weekdays and weekends as a way of compensating the lack of support. This lack of support was highlighted to manager, and eventually team lead was notified. But nothing changed. Except the 20 pounds body weight i gained for trying to catch up with the team over a long period of time (i'm still helpless for most part of my work btw).

Not only did my effort not noticed, in one instance i was also ridiculed for not performing by one of the senior in the team in a closed room. He suggested me to find another company where my ethnics could thrive (with only him in a closed room ) after lengthily critisizing my mistakes and bad work methodology. I kept calm and thanked him for the criticism as I wasn't sure how to respond and left the room. I know I have room for improvement but I don't think ethnicity have anything to do with work.

Now i admit, i'm not the best talent out there. My cgpa in university is nowhere near awesome. But i always try to do my best. But nowadays even getting out of bed is damn hard. The thought of work depresses me. It makes everything worse when younger trainees from other teams already got promoted. I feel jealous because they got a lot of help from people around them.

I felt so useless. helpless. worthless constantly. Every day, every hour.
I'm feeling as if I am sabotaged and setup to fail by own team.

If i could do everything myself, i wouldn't have accepted to be a trainee in the first place and just applied a position to my credential.

How did I get hired into this position? Am i really a super lazy entitled piece of shit who cant do anything? Should I even put effort into my work anymore? Whats the point?

I feel like everything is too late now and changing department/company is my best option....

"Abit about me.

27 years old
Currently have a bachelor of exercise science and a graduate certificate on exercise science. Initial plan was to go into physiotherapy but my marks suffered at university due to depression/anxiety for 2.5 years. I finished my course but my GPA was bad and the damage was done.
Started in 2010. Finished in 2015. 
I decided to work abit to take time off studies and intention was to alwayd study. However, seeing how the workplace is like my views on study and work have changed dramatically. I view education as in investment and want to make the right investment when I decide go retrain.

I currently work at a call center which outsources to a government department. The pay is bad but I stayed to obtain experience.Have been here for 2 years and have been promoted and recently got a role in their workforce analytics department. I HATE being in an office all day. I just feel like my day cruises by me and I get nothing completed. Im considering learning what I can and getting the skills then jumping ship.

I enjoy results and crushing goals. Needleess to say , it also doesnt help that after studying I ended up where I am and cant help but sometimes feel like a failure. But I know I can and should do better.

"I have been thinking about what I want to do in the future for a while now, but I'm still at a loss. Every time I think of a possible career option, I end up scratching it off for a reason and return to square one. I'm pretty sure no one will help me, but I'm still holding on to a glimmer of hope. It would mean a lot if someone could help me decide what I want to do in any way.

Reason why I want/don't want to go into:

Engineering: I love math and logical thinking, and I think I will enjoy engineering programs at university, but I'm not too sure about being an engineer. I don't know if I'm really a hands-on person, and it's not like I'll be the one solving math problems, either.

Medicine: I don't have much interest in biology and I feel like I'm not smart enough to enter med school. The only reason I'm considering medicine is because of job security and because I am a caring person who enjoys helping people. 

Business(especially finance): I know that finance requires math which is good however I don't have a passion for anything related to business itself. I dislike accounting. 

These are the only possible options for me I think. To be completely honest, if I could be anything in the world, I would be an animator on Youtube where I draw cartoons and tell stories and go to cons every now and then. I do believe that I am a creative person, but in the end, I can't see myself doing this at the age of 30+(not like it's gonna happen)

"Hi all

I’m unsure if anybody works in recruitment, but I could do with some advice.

I am one of my company’s top performers - there is myself and one other who generate over £1mn in profit for the business, although the other individual was handed a rather large account and is not well-liked. I’ve had to do things the hard way :-) build new accounts, develop those relationships and convert them to buying customers for my company... which I have had great success with! I now manage the staffing for multiple engineering companies across the globe.

I am approaching 5 years at my employer and I am starting to get itchy feet... I don’t know if it’s because I am not in a leadership position or if it is just because I’m getting bored of my surroundings. I am due a promotion shortly (long overdue, I actually hit my criteria 3 months ago), but I am unsure of what I wish to get in to.  Part of me is frustrated that my employer does not suggest a path for me - they are wanting me to provide them with suggestions which tells me they don’t really know what they want.

I think I have become a victim of my own success... because I make very good money on commission each month, my company are taking their time to promote me.  It’s rather frustrating when I see others who do far less getting promoted before I am 😵. 

Can anybody advise me on what they would do in my situation? Should I go big on my salary demands? Should I be disillusioned and annoyed that others seem to be getting ahead whilst I’m still on my basic pay grade?

"I am now on my third career attempt. I originally went to school to be a teacher. I was told I wasn't cut out for it by a professor. This broke my heart, so I decided to switch majors.

"At our work, we have a ""pool"" system where we have 3 managers and switch between for projects. The projects typically take 4-6 weeks. I have been here for nearly two years. Since I started, 7/12 have quit (and been replaced). As a result, I am now one of the ""veterans.""

The reason turnover has been so high is that 2 out of the 3 are really horrible managers. One of them is ""survivable"" but you have to follow a guide to survive him. I do this to the new hires, and its hit or miss whether people can stick with it. Basically, if you don't kiss his ass he makes you pay for it. If you do, you can get away with anything.

The other horrible manager was gone for a while (gave birth). This was my third time working with her and honestly, one of the reasons I  was able to survive this place was because she was gone for so long. She is a micromanager from hell.

On every project, on day one she makes you give detailed self due dates for tiny parts, and she tells you what to do first. She also has a conclusion of the project in mind, and it's so specific to her that its like a guessing game. When you send her drafts, she shoots them down at the first typo or slight mistake. She will send them back with a comment like, ""Did you even read this before sending it to me??""

This last project, I was really trying. I started, and told myself, ""ok she's the next one, be cool and just do what she says and don't argue."" But two days before the project, she emails our business partners on my behalf (a no no in my area, she is supposed to supervise whether I do the project, not do this for me) and basically spells out ""hey this guy working for me, I don't trust him to do it right so I am going to start this off.""

When I submitted work, she told me I was doing it all wrong. She wants the formatting in a very unique way to only her. When the project is done, she goes back and bolds random words (no one else does this!)

This time was the last straw. We had already agreed the project was done. We had the last meeting with our business partners, and I \*thought\* it was done. Then she gets upset because, yes I fucked up, I e mailed her the wrong draft as the final - its easy to get confused because I have like 10 drafts in my downloads because of all the revisions.  Yes, I fucked up. The fix was to send her the correct one, which was named similar. Oops right?

Nope, what do I get? I get a sudden e mail, ""clearly you have not reviewed your own work, I am assigning this project to myself."" Like, WTF? We had already sent the ""pre finalized"" version to the business partners.

So I sent a reply, ""I am sorry we do not work well together. Maybe we should not work together, no hard feelings. There is no reason to work with someone that you don't work well with.""

I got like a 3 paragraph response back that I deleted after reading the first sentence. Micromanagers always double down, always blame the worker. Micromanaging ALWAYS causes people to do less and to become demoralized.

What demoralized me early on was one of the first results I sent her, she commented, ""Did you really obtain these results?"" She implied that I didn't actually obtain them, that I somehow didn't do anything? I replied, yes, I did... and then the next day she tells me, ""I opened up the code and tried to see what we could improve on, but I could not get access to the data sets."" So, thats a way of basically saying, ""I didn't believe you did anything, so I wanted to check.""

Any one of these is ok, I don't mind a manager checking things. But its just that from day one she had no confidence in me at all, and it was apparent. I don't know what will happen to me, but she is very petty. We had three people quit in quick succession earlier this year, and I know she was hardcore trying to ""manage out"" two of them. Our turnover is so bad though they can't really fire me.",I stood up to a vindictive micromanager today,1
"So I left my job as a clinical specimen processor I was at for 4 and a half years at the end of July. I had 2 job interviews with this place for a medical receptionist job at a pediatrician's office and they both go well. I accepted the job offer. I realized I was taking a good pay cut but in favor of being closer to home and daytime hours as a parent, I accepted. After I started there, I learned not too long that the training was very inconsistent and disorganized. The office nurse complained about how things aren't run properly there. I apparently got some complaints from some parents about sounding unsure about some things (which I thought would be expected from a new person but perhaps not). The inconsistent answers I got from the manager and the receptionist who has been there for 10 years was quite frustrating. The doctors changing their minds about some things was also a source of frustration.

I tried to keep up with the workload and improve based on some feedback I got but by the time I made improvements it was too late. I realize there are some things I could've done better, and I realize that perhaps being a receptionist truly wasn't a good fit for me. I admit that maybe I should've talked about my autism to my new employer but was worried it would impact my ability to get hired. The manager did tell me she likes me a lot as a person and said ""you're brilliant, the technical skills are there, and you're a great person. I'm not sure if it's the workload that's too much or what it is but \[name of place\] just isn't a fit for you"". She did say that she's willing to make me a letter of recommendation but I'm not sure if I want to mention this job on my resume or Linkedin profile now.

I feel like I had too much going on in my life that may have contributed. I took a disability leave from my old job for a couple months related to depression. This happened after a domestic violence related incident back in March with my ex boyfriend. Because of said incident, I left my son's dad and went back to my parents' house. I was walking on thin ice with my old job because my manager was upset I was taking so many phone calls and such from police officers, detectives, my lawyer, etc. and was part of why I went on FMLA to begin with.

I guess what I want to know Reddit is, what should I do now? Do I leave this job off my resume? Did I jump into a job with very different job duties too soon given my circumstances? How do I explain this to future employers? Should I start mentioning my autism to employers from hereon out? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","Lost job after 5 weeks, feeling at a loss as to what to do next",1

"  

Good Morning,

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to make this sob story as short as possible:

&amp;#x200B;

2012

▪ I graduated from one of the top four universities (prestigious name) in Ontario,Canada with a business degree. 

▪ Heart set on becoming a CA (that was the professional accounting designation at the time) → very motivated, busted my ass for grades, have fairly good grades.

&amp;#x200B;

2013

&amp;#x200B;

Did a winter contract for a small CA firm, some light bookkeeping, but mostly personal tax returns 

&amp;#x200B;

▪ After the contract was over, got another contract at a bookkeeping firm→ doing mostly tax. 

&amp;#x200B;

▪ At both of these firms I wasn’t treated respectfully, which made me resent accounting, then one day I thought to myself f—k it! I love soccer and I am very “good” at it (varsity and team Ontario), let me go to Europe to play professional soccer (made this dumb decision on a whim, with most people telling me that this idea is stupid and that I should just play soccer recreationally whilst pursuingmy CA (Accounting career). 

▪ June → I took a flight to Heathrow.

&amp;#x200B;

2014- June 2016

&amp;#x200B;

▪ Had an awesome time playing soccer in Europe (not the major leagues, of course), until in mid June 2016 I had an ugly wake up call: I was not making much progress to playing in the big leagues, I was earning slightly more than a McDonalds employee, and all my friends back home where earning at least twice as much and all had their accounting designations (CA, CMA, CGA at the time) 

▪ Spent the last bit of 2016 figuring out what I was going to do with my life→ at the time I thought insurance would be easy money with little academic requirement.

&amp;#x200B;

2017

&amp;#x200B;

▪ Spent the winter working on contract, at an insurance brokerage→ realized that I knew nothing about insurance, and most importantly; I hated how boring the work was (yes, I found it significantly more boring than accounting, which I don’t really find boring) ▪ Summer/Fall: Worked in a junior accounting role in an auto parts company (on contract). My contract wasn’t renewed.

&amp;#x200B;

2018

▪ Not a productive year: spent it mostly on studying for courses to upgrade for the new CPA program. I took a whole year to finish just two courses→ I just wasn’t as motivated/focussed as I was in my last year of university.

▪ Another reason was there were also some personal tragedies which occurred which took up a lot of time. 

**Now**

&amp;#x200B;

Have a small tax business, not earning much (intending to apply for work)

▪ Very unmotivated to do the CPA 

**▪ Very bitter and angry at myself for making such an incredibly stupid decision back in 2013 ( I see it as the biggest mistake in my life)**

**▪ Most people are telling me that since I am in late thirties (yes started very late in life I know L → I should just stick it out in accounting→ far too late to be switching careers.** 

 ▪ My one friend recommended I should start a painting business since its ‘easy money’, or to become a mechanic (he believes I’m not cut out to become an accountant). However, most of my friends recommend the previous bullet point. I have no experience in painting.

▪ If you gave me a time machine and let me go back to my mid twenties → I would of became a plumber or lawyer. 

**▪ My current goals are to purchase a house, and eventually earn at least 90-100k a year.** 

▪ Currently am single with no children. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1) Should I pursue accounting? (Or start a painting business?)

2) Should I do my CPA/ACCA in the states/UK? 

3) Where in accounting should I work? 

4) What would you do if you were in my position?

I will not be entertaining any questions about my soccer career→ this post is intended for future career guidance.

Please note the serious tab→ all immature replies will be reported.

&amp;#x200B;

If you read this post in its entirety, and offer a mature reply, I will be deepfully grateful. 

I am desperate.

"So... I really need some help/advice...anything.

I am 23 and have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. I have been a nurse for two years now and developed panic disorder and chronic migraines. I do not know if nursing exacerbated the panic disorder and chronic migraines or not. The long shifts and intense interactions with patients really drain me though. I find myself needing to call in sick for nausea, vomiting, migraines, and panic attacks. 

I eat healthy. I exercise. I have good friends and family. I pray. I meditate. I go to counseling. I take medication. I got extremely good grades all my life. I am an ""achiever."" 

Should I stay in nursing? Should I try a different area of nursing? I would like to try a different area but I want a job that is intellectually stimulating. I worry that I hop between jobs too much because I get bored and depressed when I stay at a nursing job. I want to try different industries...but I also think I do like nursing deep down. When I think about anything I could do I want to be an entrepreneur or be a nurse practitioner in a rural clinic, while rock climbing and skiing in all my time off. When I think about this too much...I feel like I will not like any job and I am destined to a work life of misery. 

What should I do? Where should I go from here? I am a capable person...I am just devoid on energy, passion, joy, hope, and everything right now (this has been going on in cycles for the last couple years...I don't think it's temporary).

"A month ago I withdrew my candidacy from a job I was interviewing for. The job appeared pretty good, it would have been about $15k more and the environment seemed fun. Though I didn't really get a good idea of what the day to day was going to be like. The interview process was drawn out. 2 phone interviews. A code challenge. 2 hr in person interview and a final vid conference interview. I withdrew before the final vid interview.

Part of the reason I withdrew is that I am not unhappy with my job and I am still learning.
I cited company loyalty as one of the main reasons I was staying. After I sent the email, I felt I made a mistake. I've regretted it ever since. Now I am unhappy with my job. Nothing has really changed in my current role for me to feel so bad. I'm wondering how much of my regret is FOMO. I also think most of the reason I pulled put was fear of failing at the new job.

Anyhow. The job is still posted. They're hiring for a few positions. A recruiter even contacted me last week about it. Which tells me they might be having trouble filling the spots.

"TLDR at end.

I have an second ""interview"" tomorrow for a career path I am very excited for after my current ""dream job"" decided to suck the soul out of me. I put interview in quotes because I will be doing a 10 - 15 minute presentation on a health promotion program plan I created after I learned I had a second interview - their second interview prompt was to create a health program. Then they will ask me questions about the program, and they explicitly state several times that there will be room at the end for my own questions.

The position is Health Educator at a rural hospital. The presentation will be before 13 people. The people consist of the position's team members and supervisor.

I always like to ask at least 2 questions at the end of every interview, but with trying to make this program plan in 1 week, I totally forgot to think of any. And I don't know what kind of questions to ask such a large group of people.

I have already asked, ""What would a successful first year look like?"" and clarifying questions about the position like, ""Is this a new position?"" ""Are there supporting positions, or does the Health Educator position work independently?"" ""The job posting prefers this qualification, why is that?""

Anyway, I also go to school for my Masters in Accounting, and I only have 2 classes left. These classes are the hardest of the whole program.

I'm torn between taking at least one class this semester while working full time in my new job - which itself feels like a class, so hard! -, or focusing just on the job I'm doing. The job is very hard, and I feel like I'm struggling, kind of the weakest link and under qualified at times tbh :(

 I might get a promotion to a senior position next year if my performance is good enough. Also, the job doesn't demand me to finish my masters, so theoretically I could put the masters on hold. Additionally, if I push off finishing my masters, maybe 6 months after next year's promotion I could leverage that to ask for a raise bc of graduating from the masters.",Need Advice - should i take a semester off from my MSA or not?,1

"First of all, I know that I'm dealing with very privileged first-world problems, so I'm not complaining about my good fortune. But here's the decision I'm looking at.   


I currently have a job in tech in the PNW. We paid off our house and our lifestyle is pretty good. I've been a little dissatisfied at work so I applied to a job working on autonomous vehicles and I'm heading down for the onsite interview soon. The job is in Palo Alto and they are not open to remote employment.   


Pros: 

1. This kind of work is seriously in my wheelhouse and I think I can do well at it. 
2. I feel like once I get some experience in this field, it will be a very valuable skill and will lead to other opportunities if I don't end up staying at this company. 
3. My area of focus is in 3D graphics, and a lot of the jobs I'm seeing are looking for that as an afterthought, and honestly I find back end work less interesting and would love to find a place where 3D is all I have to work on. This seems to fit the bill. 
4. The salary range is good and they offer equity.   


Cons: 

1. Moving! I'm happy up here and would not choose to move to the Bay area. 
2. The cost of housing is frightening! We'd most likely go from a house that backs to the woods to an apartment.
3. Loss of our support network.
4. We live in a great foodie city and I'm not sure Sunnyvale or Mountain View will compare.

  
So even though we haven't gotten to the official offer stage, I'm weighing the whole idea and trying to see what things I need to consider.

So many questions!  


1. Should we rent out our current house in case we want to come back? Has anyone ever hired a management company and how did that work out?
2. How do I go about really comparing the cost of living? How do people survive in such a crazy housing environment?
3. How do RSUs play out in the real world? Are they ephemeral or do you consider those as actual compensation?
4. Any thoughts on where the best places to live would be if I needed to commute to Palo Alto?
5. Any thoughts on life in the Bay area?

So, I am in the tech field, developer. I will give a brief description of my current job, pros/cons, and then the one that offered me a position. Perhaps I can gain some insight from those who have a bit more experienced jumping companies. I usually spend a long time at a company. I know in the tech world, that is a no no......

I am a little on the older side (50yr - old for tech field, but i have not noticed any discrimination. I got a late start in this field, as I was previously a teacher &amp; musician), so I don't have 25yrs to make adjustments/save/take risks. I am not risk aversive. I tend to stick in one place for a long time, and i found that is detrimental in the tech field as one stagnats, gets complacent..... and even though my current company has great perks, I am very comfortable &amp; complacent. My previous job, I was there over 10yrs and said I wouldn't do that again. Again, stagnating because I was valued and just stagnated in skills. Always had to gain new skills with outside learning.

***CURRENT JOB:***

\------------------------

**title**: lead engineer

**years at company**: 4yrs

**salary**: 150k

**options**: 15k, fully vested.

**chances the company will get acquired/public soon**: Very slim, currently not profitable after ups/downs. Many funding rounds.

**Job description**: Lead, but I don't lead anything. I am just an individual contributor with a ""lead"" title to qualify the raise. Every engineer on the team is an island unto themselves, no real ""leaders"". The Project managers etc.. defer to me. But there's only 2 other engineers on the team, but they are on their own products, doing their own things.

**PROS:** Great people, company culture, take sick days, vacay w/o any issues. Come in late, leave early, all good. No issues. Basically, you get your work done, they don't care what you do. They treat you like an adult until you stop acting like one. I mean, within reason. Work from home whenever you want. People are SUPER cool. Stocked kitchen. Salary is real good. Decent benefits. Just a ton of flexibility. Transparency is important to them. Close by, 25 minute drive. They pay high to keep people.

**CONS:** In a non-profitable phase for like 7 months. Currently using funding (various funding phases). Engineering management is non-existent (no managers, no VP). Projects are half-baked, and not really thought out. Every company meeting, all sunshine and roses, everything is awesome, next few months are gonna BE AWESOME!!!! (just never lives up to the promises). CTO does not give up any power, so engineering management is either fired, or they leave. Org is very flat, no real upward mobility, and at this point my skills are stagnating. I take online courses to keep up with things, but I am not learning anymore. But those pros!!! lol.

***NEW COMPANY***

***----------------------------***

**title**: principle engineer

**salary**: 140k

**options**: 53k, 4yr vesting period.

**chances the company will get acquired/public soon**: Pretty good. Current funding from a major corporate entity. Though, of course, no guarantees... just paper at this point.

**Job description**: This is were things are a bit different. The VP was adamant that I would be doing principle/lead activities. My title would fit the job description. I would get to define/architect/mentor and lead the team.

**PROS:** Don't know. I interviewed with the people, they seem cool and engaged. All have a positive outlook and like the direction of the company. It seems a bit more serious than my current job. Close by, 30-35minute drive. I know a few people at the new company, by chance, and they all really dig the company. Possibility to really grow as a developer, and do what I was suppose to, lead/mentor/manage people.

**CONS:** They are offering 10k lower. Being that I am gonna fulfill my title duties, I am very nervous. Change you know? But I am gonna counter (see below).

\---------------- Each company has the same benefits, no 401k matching, and health is comparable ---------------------

**NOTE**: I ADJUSTED THE SALARIES SLIGHTLY FROM THEIR REAL VALUES, BUT DIFF IS THE SAME, PERCENTAGE WISE.

    MY COUNTER: 145k, Accelerated Vesting. &lt;-- what do you think.

"Look, this may come out as stupid but these are just merely observations from my end.

So the tech industry is at an all-time high, with everything nowadays being on-demand it's easier to do business with each other. To me this shows how much things have changed just for the past 10 years.

Back then software developers were the elite in their field churning out great products with technical wizardry (of course not without its issues!). Devs were either CS, IT, or Computer Engineering graduates. Now almost anyone can be a software developer or can work in the tech industry. Especially in the advent of cloud ERP systems / SaaS, professionals from other industries are flocking in. Gone are the days where the technical people ruled the tech world. Now you get left behind if you only have hardcore technical knowledge in hardware and software, you had to have the industry expertise in the products they're delivering. For example at a cloud ERP company, business and accountancy graduates usually outperform IT grads due to their understanding of the product.

What does this mean for the tech industry? I think it's awesome that we get to have people with industry experience on board, but this certainly instills fear for the IT people where their technical expertise is put to the side as they now have to learn industries outside of their own. This makes room for growth and career development.

I also see the issue of burnout and the changes of the work environment. With everything being on-demand, consumer patience is usually lower than zer0 and want things to be up and running ASAP. Who can blame them? They invested money and/or time on the product, and want answers right away. This may have lead to some poor work-life balance with some tech employees having to work on shifts or lose weekends to resolve an issue.

In a world where we value convenience and availability over functionality and reliability, it's easy to see why tech has to change this way. It has made our world smaller, and transact with people around the world in mere seconds.

Tech employees are today's factory workers.

"I'm 32, and a few years back became effectively dehbilitated overnight due to a prescription med. I had to leave my job/career/lost all my money and have been surviving off disability since.

I'm gradually recovering although daily life can still be a struggle with the symptoms. I'm often in pain and discomfort and struggle going out (I've lived most of the past 2.5 years in a room).

My family are fairly dysfunctional and for the most part I've been dealing with this by myself. I'm currently living with a parent temporarily as my last housemate became an alcoholic and I didn't feel secure in our joint tenancy. So I thought I'd come here for 6 months-1 year before being able to get back out on my own.
But now this situation has become stressful (I think both my parents are going through severe mental health issues).

Ultimately I feel I need to move out asap; prioritise self-preservation and ""put on my own oxygen mask first"".

So here's my question (to enable this within the circumstantial parameters): what are the realistic options for making money through a laptop?

I'm very creative and good at designing/communication but also attracted to decent paying online work (who isn't!) which I feel might be in other sectors..?

I currently make some money as an artist/illustrator with the odd commission but feel a bit overwhelmed with marketing potential (i.e where to start) and have no real capital for investment. 
I do feel maybe learning Photoshop could open up more avenues, but again, more investment and seems like a saturated market?

I'm a songwriter and have a profile on Fiverr offering my services as a musician (saxophonist)/lyricist but again, seems to be overly saturated and not really consistent.

I'm tempted to look into things like tech/marketing/coding/copywriting..anything that can bring in fairly decent money that I can work on at night (when I'm in less pain) but I just don't feel I have the luxury of time to explore all the options and then invest time in teaching myself loads of new skills.

It could take me 6 months+ just focusing on 1 thing to even -maybe- be competitive enough to gain clients in any field.

So I'm just wondering what people's thoughts are on this? Maybe someone has been in a similar position and somehow rebuilt their finances/life back up through a laptop?",Creating financial stability whilst debilitated?,1

"I don't know how to keep this short, but I'll try. I'm a 30 F creative/tech professional who works for a huge but not well-known company. I have a history of trauma, PTSD, and ADD which I mask well but sometimes impedes me a lot. I've been rejected, abused, and disrespected A LOT in my life and anything that reminds me of that fact is hugely triggering. I don't deal well with criticism, internalize *everything*, and tend to retreat into myself when it happens.

The company culture I work in is toxic. That's a fact. There's disorganization, mismanagement, and scapegoating galore. Sycophants are rewarded, and everyone else can go fuck themselves. The managers cover their own asses and throw others under the bus to save themselves. We've had two rounds of firings, and some good people leave on their own because they couldn't take it anymore. I've managed to keep my head above the fray for the most part and accept that getting shit on is a normal part of the experience here.

I pressured my manager to give me a performance review (they don't like doing them) in July, and they didn't have anything too negative to say as well as some good feedback. They turned down my request for a raise, a title change -- ANYTHING. They told me that they could be open to paying for educational opportunities if I stumbled upon anything I wanted to take and took note of some tooling I requested to help me.

None of those things happened. My request for tooling has been slow-walked, and my boss rejected my request to expense a $500 class. (Keep in mind this is a multi-billion dollar company but they do this shit to everyone). This was a big knock to my confidence and made me feel like I have no value to this company. When my confidence gets knocked, it's hard to invest in work, but I've done my best to carry one. Unfortunately, my good work friend who I worked with closely left at the end of last month, leaving a big gap in the process. I started getting a lot of ad hoc assignments that are hard to keep up with, and with feeling depressed, my attention to detail slipped as I started to feel overwhelmed and no place to ask for help.

Last week, the shit hit the fan in my personal life. Without going into too much detail, I got doxxed and harassed on the internet by an unstable, vicious person. He slandered my name and professional reputation all over social media and tweeted my name and image at all hours for four days. He even tweeted me @ my company though I'm not sure if anyone saw it. This was profoundly stressful and the aftermath still is as I don't know if it's going to rear its head again. I told both of my managers about it in case he tried to contact them. They told me I was safe and seemed concerned for my wellbeing.

Today, I had my monthly performance check-in with my direct manager. He basically told me that my performance during the last month has been nothing short of disappointing. Nothing I've done has been up to snuff, but he wants to ""help me succeed."" (Surrrre) He enumerated something awful about just about every project I've worked on. And told me that my work is inconsistent, I require too much oversight, and I can't take direction. The only thing I've done right this month? The polls I post in Slack are funny and good for our culture. So basically, none of my extensive work on our products drives value or is good enough.

I knew I'd been a little disengaged this month, but the fact that he would tell me that my performance is suddenly terrible after I'd disclosed to him that I'm the victim of a harasser doesn't seem like a coincidence. It's clear I've been marked as a liability by these managers and should GTFO before they push me out. I'm not happy to say that I broke down in the meeting and admitted I was having a hard time with my mental health and PTSD with flashbacks (ugh, stupid, I know, but I was just so, so upset and embarrassed). He said the boilerplate manager things about that and said they could connect me to ""resources.""

I know this is the death knell for my career here. I've been in touch with recruiters and am getting submitted for jobs left and right and have some phone screenings. I think I've got about a month before I'm cut, but this is terrible for my mental health, and I'm not sure how I can stay engaged with my work here knowing that my manager wants me out. How can I continue to work here AND maintain my confidence in interviewing/job searching?

Has anyone ever bounced back from something like this? I feel like I'm living in an absolute hellscape and honestly, if it weren't for my fiance, I'd probably blow up my life -- start over in a new city -- or fucking end it.

\*TLDR:\*

Have a history of trauma. Workplace is toxic and I've been feeling stressed here for a long time but keeping my head above water. I got doxxed by a harasser on the internet. Told my managers because I was concerned about safety/him contacting them. They seemed supportive. Now, a week later, I'm getting terrible performance feedback and know I'm being pushed out of this role. I broke down crying, admitted I had PTSD and was struggling with severe stress and mental health -- bad move. Now trying to scramble to find other opportunities, but my psyche is damaged immensely by this and doesn't feel resilient enough to get through this with my career and self-worth intact.","I'm having one of the most traumatic, stressful weeks of my career.

"Hello,

I'm a 25 year old Real Estate/Finance Professional. I feel like I am at a crossroads with my career in the sense that I have to dedicate more time to my work, based on seniority and experience, and I find this proposition slightly daunting. 

I as a consultant in a reputable global company which was a very good experience in the first year. However, in my second year, an ED (my manager) left, and was not replaced, meaning that his workload was then split between myself and another colleague. This was a great step up in responsibility, but I have noticed standards dropping in other parts of the business, and have raised this to senior management, to no avail. I have also found it increasingly difficult to get support and the workload being relatively demanding. This has hampered on client service and has in a way damaged my reputation in the industry slightly. Revenue targets are also aggressive, and stressful to a degree. 

However, there are of course, positives about this job, which is that it provides good hours (compared to other roles of similar pay).  This is also because I manage a lot of the time lines, and have a bit of flexibility.  My issue is that I don't believe what we do at the company is industry standard, and I am worried that I will become irrelevant in my industry.  

I considered staying, on the basis that this job provides good remuneration for the hours I work, and potentially staying around and 'managing' work, which is what a lot of the senior people in the company do. (i.e. they attend work to get paid).  The pros to this would be being able to do things outside of work (I am starting up an online store).

On the flip side, I can aggressively grow myself (and my salary) in the industry. I have been interviewing for a job with a large reputable REPE firm, and while this job will be averaging 11 hours a day, it will provide me with immense industry experience and set me up for the future. Pay would be better on an absolute basis, but on a per hour basis, it would be much worse. I am seeing this as an investment in industry knowledge more so than a pay increase. 

TLDR: Should I stay in a mediocre job that pays relatively well and  has good hours/start a business on the side vs working long hours for experience and knowledge and developing my career (pay and knowledge wise)

"Hello Internet,

I'm currently in a dilemma. As I have just entered Senior year of high school, I am faced with many questions about the future. I am planning on attending a local university, and am faced with what I should peruse. My father is an electrical/mechanical engineer who owns a business, and with the influence from him to become a engineer, I'm thinking about majoring in Mechanical Engineering, since I take more interest from that vs. Electrical Engineering. (Mechanical Engineering - Design is more of what I seem to enjoy). 

I, on the other half, really love history. Ever since I took AP European History, AP United States History, and am currently taking AP Gov. &amp; Pol. (which, as so far, I seem to enjoy Gov. the most, then Euro) I have developed a passion for the topic of History. With my current class of Gov., I'm really enjoying learning about government and how it has relations to history. After looking at what majors I can get with these interests, I have found that I could major in Political Science and History. 

I would love to study history and gov. in university, but I'm in doubt on what jobs I could get with a major in these subjects. It seems to me as I could get a more stable, well paying job in mechanical engineering rather than a liberal arts major such as Political Science and History. I would like to have a career in which I know will be reliable long term, stable would be an ideal word for it. 

I know that one should pursue their passions, regardless of other variables, but I don't want to major in something that is, per say, ""useless"" (no offense, really). I'm just trying to figure what I could do with all of these majors. I don't want to major in something and not get a job in relation to the major, and end up working in a coffee shop.

I know that with history major, one could go into education and teach history, but that has not appealed to me. Political Science, I have heard many graduates go into Law school, which seems cool. I'm not exactly sure on what Law school is, and what the career for that means, hence I cannot make a judgement on it, so information would be helpful. What other career options could I get with these two majors?

I thought about majoring in both Mechanical Engineering and Political Science, what do you think about this idea?

You can also watch this as an [Animated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72S-AIWgmTw) instead if you prefer. 

  
**Step 1: Make a deadline for deciding which career or experiment to try first**

Remember parkinsons law: ""work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"". So the more time you give yourself. The more time you are going to use and still achieve the same thing.

  
**Step 2: Make a list of what you enjoy**Here you can ask yourself questions such as:

* What subjects could I read 500 books about without getting bored?
* What would I do if I had all the money I would ever need?
* What did I enjoy as a child?
* Think of a really exciting day in the past. What were you doing?
* What am I curious about?
* What are you doing when you lose track of time?
* What makes you feel alive?

These questions are all useful, but the only way to be 100% sure about whether you enjoy doing something is to actually do it and see how much you enjoy it.

  
**Step 3: Make a list of your core values:**

* How do I behave?
* Who do I admire and why?
* Imagine you could start your life over again. What values would you live by?

You don't have to be clear about your values now, since you'll get to know them through experience.

  
**Step 4: Make a list of what kind of work conditions you prefer**

* How important is money?
* What kind of lifestyle should the career be able to support?
* Indoor vs. outdoor work
* Talk with people, use your hands or sit behind a computer?
* Is job security important?
* Do you want to have your own business or work for someone else?
* Is an oppurtunity for growth important to you?
* Do you thrive in a high stress environment

Keep in mind that it will be much easier for you to answer these questions when you have actually started your career.

  
**Step 5: Make a list of your skills**

* What comes easy to you?
* What am I doing when I lose track of time?
* What made me stand out as a child?
* What do people complement me on?
* Which things does people ask me to help them with?
* What things makes me feel strong?
* What comes naturally to me?

I can also recoomend taking the CliftonStrenghts test to find your strenghts.Remember that you don't HAVE to be an expert right now. You need a growth mindset, which means that you believe you can improve if you practice.It's also again important to remember that the best way of knowing what your strenghts are is to actually do things and see what you're good at.  
Now you have a list of what you enjoy, your core values, what work conditions you prefer and your skillsIf you feel like you could add more to them you can:

* Google common passions, core values, skills and so on to get inspired
* Ask your friends to evaluate what they think your core values, passions, skills and so on are to get another perspective.
* Self assesment test online (The big five and careerexplorer.com)

Don't worry if you're not sure about everything on your lists. Most people don't know that much about themselves. The only way to know more about yourself for sure is to test and get some real world experience.

  
**Step 6: Make a list of careers that seem aligned with your list of what you enjoy, your core values, the work conditions you prefer and your skills.**

If you can't think of anything you can:

* See which careers are recommended to you when you take self assesment tests.
* Find a list of careers online and see which ones seem interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 7: Get more clarity on the careers on your list and remove those that seem less aligned with what you want.**You can start by removing those you are sure you can remove.For example if:

* You don't want to sit on the computer for more than one hour everyday, then you can drastically reduce your options
* If you want to work from home, you can remove all careers where that isn't possible
* If you want to start your own business, then you can remove all those that don't support that

If you want more clarity on the careers on your list before you eliminate anything, then you can:

* Talk to people in those professions or job shadow them
* Research the careers
* Look at concrete job offers
* Talk with career counselor, friends, Career Coach or someone else, to get more clarity.
* Journal

Getting clarity this way will also help you later when you have to make the decision!

  
**Step 8: Make sure fear or limiting beliefs don't hold you back from pursuing something you want**

To find your fears you can ask yourself:

* What am I afraid of?

And to find your limiting beliefs, you can ask yourself

* If I don't believe I can become good at this career, then why do I think that way?

For your fears you can simply define the worst case scenario and that way maybe realise it's something you can livewith.For your limiting beliefs you can ask yourself questions such as:

* where does this belief come from?
* What would this belief look like from another persons perspective?
* What would be some counter examples to this belief?
* What price do I pay for having this limiting belief?
* Another belief that might be more accurate?

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 9: Decide which career to pursue or an experiment to try**

Okay now it's finally time to PULL THE TRIGGER!So now you can either choose the first career you want to try or run an experiment to test some of your core values, skills, passions or prefered working conditions.If you can't try the career without commiting to alot, then it's probably best to run some experiments first, so you can verify if you actually want that career, before you invest too much into it.  
But wait.. how do you make the final decision on which career to try out first?You can either:

* Use your rational mind and weight up the pro's and con's
* Go with your gut instinct.

Several studies have shown that your ratinal mind is better for simple decisions, while your gut instinct is better for complex decisions where you can't easily compare all available information.I will make another video that describes more about when you should listen to your gut instinct and when you should use your rational mind  
Finally you can ask yourself: ""Would I regret this decision on my death bed?""If you wouldn't then it's time to try it 🙂

  
**Step 10: If you found your ideal career then that's great. Otherwise, go back to step 1.**But... how can you know if you found your ideal career?  
These are some of the signs that you have picked the right thing:

* You look forward to getting to work
   * Or at least you don't experience the sunday blues
* You may even experience flow
* You feel alignment
* If people ask: ""Do you like your career?"" You are not hesitant to say: ""yes!"".
* You want to become good at what you do
* Time flies away quickly when working
* You feel engaged
* You talk happily about work outside work

&amp;#x200B;

Well.. Does that always mean you should quit your career if you don't experience those things?Here are some exceptions:

* Maybe you need to give it some more time
   * Maybe it will be more fun when you are more competent?
   * Maybe you just picked something that is too difficult as a beginner?
   * If you read ""Be so good they can't ignore you"" by Cal Newport, then you'll know that you need Career capital (Rare and valuable skills) in order to satisfy your 3 universal psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness, which are the things that will make you happy in a career.
* Maybe you are just in the wrong company
* Remember all people have bad days and no career is fun all the time.
* And remember the grass is always greener on the other side.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you've considered all these things and still want to do something else, then just go back to step 1

* Update your list of what you enjoy, your personal values, what work conditions you prefer and your skills
* Make a new list of careers
* Get clarity on them and eliminate those that are less aligned with what you want
* make sure fear and limiting beliefs don't hold you back
* Decide on a new career or experiment to try
* If you found your ideal career then that's great. Otherwise just repeat the process

"Hi guys,

I have a situation on my hand that I would like to have your opinions on. I currently work for a company in San Francisco that treats me well and the work isn't too bad. I was promoted to senior analyst in January 2019, and people around me generally recognize my value for the company and my skill sets so I am happy with where I am. The problem came when I got a new manager around March 2019 who is located in Utah. She micromanages, and has insatiable appetite for gossips, alienates certain team members, bad mouth people I work with in San Francisco, and most importantly I cannot get the guidance and help I need from a manager, let alone the fact that she has no technical understanding of what I do.

So I looked around the company and applied for another position. Have been talking to the manager of this team, she seemed great and very knowledgable, willing to teach. The other teammate also seems intelligent and personable. Problem is, I will start from the bottom since it is a new role, and will have to relocate from San Francisco to Seattle. I relocated from Chicago to San Francisco to join the company in March 2018, and has since built meaningful personal relationships with coworkers in SF, and has a steady strong relationship with my boyfriend who also lives in SF.

I made [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duzjh11qp5s) video about how to choose a career when you have TOO many options! 

&amp;#x200B;

# My story:

Let me tell you where I was 3 years ago.

I was just about to enter my 2 gap years and I made a goal. I wanted to know which career out of all possible careers is the best one for me. So I researched all possible careers and all the different kinds of education I could take to get there. I tried to make a list of my passions, my skills, my core values and what kind of work conditions I prefer. I made a list of all possible careers I could take that seemed just slightly interesting. I compared all the different careers one by one and eliminated those that were less aligned with my passions, skills, core values and what I wanted in a career. I was able to eliminate careers until I only was considering about 12 different careers. Then I spend the remaining of the 2 years just researching those careers and making pro's and con's list and contemplating which one I should choose. I wanted to pick the perfect one. But no matter how much I researched and thought about it, I didn't get any further, because I made one crucial mistake.

I only thought about and researched the different careers, instead of just trying them. Thinking about the careers and researching them gave me some clarity, but I should have spend less time on that and more time testing them out.

I did play music and started programming though, and that gave me some clarity about what I wanted to do.

So to make sure you don't make the same mistake as me, I want to give you a step by step plan for navigating between all these different career opportunities you have.

&amp;#x200B;

# Remember when trying to choose a career you'll have to know:

* What you want in a career
   * What you enjoy
   * What your core values are
   * What work conditions you prefer
* What the market wants
* What you can provide.

&amp;#x200B;

If we make some generalizations there are **4 ways for you to get the answer to these questions:**

1. Contemplate (Thinking and journaling)
2. Ask other people (In-person and online)
3. Research
4. Get real-world experience

&amp;#x200B;

# My crucial mistake:

The good thing about contemplating, asking other people and researching is that it can be a fast way to narrow down your options to a more manageable list. But at some point, you won't get more clarity this way. I wasted almost 2 years just contemplating, asking other people and researching. A few months would have been more than enough.

**In my case, I was still left with questions, such as:**

* Would I rather do something technical or more creative?
* Do I want to work in a company or have my own business?
* Am I sure that I want to sit down in front of a computer for at least 8 hours a day?

How would I ever be able to answer these questions by only contemplating, asking other people and researching? I needed to test out the different careers or make experiments to find the answers to these questions, but unfortunately, I didn't realize that back then...

I tried to choose the perfect career the first time by just thinking about it. The problem with that approach is that we learn which career we want from real-world experience, but I was only thinking about what the best choice would be.

I should instead have taken a more iterative approach where I think about what the best career choice would be, then try that or an experiment and get some feedback I can use to choose the next career if I'm not satisfied with the current choice.

&amp;#x200B;

# So this is what the process could look like:

Step 1: Make a deadline for when you decide on the first career to try (To make sure you don't just stay contemplating)

Step 2: Make a list of what you enjoy (Because you have to look forward to getting to work)

Step 3: Make a list of your core values (Because your career has to be congruent with these values)

Step 4: Make a list of what kind of work conditions you prefer (Because how can you get something, if you haven't defined what it is?)

Step 5: Make a list of your skills (Because how can you get paid for something you can't do? But remember to have a growth mindset and realize you can learn skills)

Step 6: Make a list of careers that seem aligned with your list of what you enjoy, your core values,the work conditions you prefer and your skills.

Step 7: Get more clarity on the careers on your list and remove those that seem less aligned with what you want.

Step 8: Make sure fear or limiting beliefs don't hold you back from pursuing something you want

Step 9: Decide which career to pursue or an experiment to try

Step 10: If you found your ideal career then that's great. Otherwise, go back to step 1.

I’ve(25F) been thinking recently that I would like to change my job.

I’ve been working for over 5 years in IT as a tech support person and went through a wiiiide spectrum of companies, types of support, different trainings and all and I got the point where I don’t see myself doing this for the rest of life. Hell, maybe not even for the next 2-3 years. 

It gets mentally exhausting at times (I know that it happens with every job) and also I got pretty bored of it. I don’t want the latter to sound harsh, I do love what I am doing now but I kind of feel like I could do more.

There is room to grow in my field, and even in the company where I am at now. I also loooove my current team and I think that they are one of the reasons to why I am still here but it is such a difficult process to move in a lateral direction that it makes me say “can’t be bothered”

I was thinking of going into media/design as that has been a dream that was put on hold so many times that I just kind of gave up on it.

Any advice? Either on how to make the transition/where to start or how to “fall in love” with my job again?

1. Should I process double major about Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, or Computational Engineering before graduating with Math? When I search for the related internships, they do not prefer my major: Math.
2. What should I complement my plan to get a job related the fields(AI, Machine Learning and so on)?

"I feel like every major decision I have made regarding my career was only made because I felt pressured.

I went to college directly after high school with the original intention of getting a degree in biology because I knew that STEM was employable. I hated it, and halfway through my degree I couldn't take it any more. I switched to history because I love history, and I really excelled for the rest of my college career (was given funded research opportunities, TA positions, and a lot of meaningless awards). I worked in a public library from the time I had graduated high school until a little after college graduation. I did really well there too, but I realized that upward mobility (aka, getting a full time position) was not going to happen. No one ever leaves. I decided I needed to go to grad school and researched my options. I chose to move cities to enroll in a Masters in public administration program. I literally chose the school because it was close to home and I had family and friends in the city. I did do a bit of research on the program, but it was not what I expected. I tried to stick it out, but the program wasn't teaching me anything that I felt was interesting or useful, so rather than continue to waste my money, I dropped the program and moved back home. Around the same time, a position opened up in a government office back home and I got the job. I was ecstatic...

Until recently, when I realized that I hate it. My job isn't really about helping people and making things better for the people, it's about pushing paper and crunching numbers. My experience has taught me a few things about myself.

1) I don't ever want to work for the government again.

2) I don't want to do a desk job. I want to do something hands-on.

My career options are a bit limited out here, but I am willing to travel a ways or maybe move as long as I am still close to home (my parents are aging and need me around since I'm their only child).

"Hello all.

I've been in the Oil &amp; Gas sector for 15 years now. I took on to it fairly quickly as I've always been a very tech obsessed person, even went to college for a short while intending to major in C.S. The tech, machinery, and mostly the money of the oilfield quickly derailed my initial plans. 15 years later, I'm definitely far out earning any degree I could have obtained.

However I'm not blind to the times and unstoppable forward progress of man. Eventually my industry will shrink and I will need a solid foundation to fall back on.

Other things that bother me the most are the unfairness and untransparency going on in the team, has been like this for a long time and this disgusts me. Maybe I'm really not doing as great as I thought, or even I AM doing great but she doesn't want to promote me cos she has a tendency to only promote or lean to those who will 'obey her', 'follow the orders' instead of people that who want to do things right and not afraid of giving honest advice and suggestions. I'm sorry if I make it sounds like a cultural thing...

Some more context: I'm a female, working at non-technical **niche field**. I have been looking for jobs and applying here and there for the past half-year. I got to have interviews with two big companies, both got rejected at the end. I'm still looking, but many jobs out there don't meet the total compensation that I'm making now. Since I'm in a niche field, it makes it harder for me to find another job. I've thought about quitting but without another job lining up I'm afraid if I quit, it can take months (6 if lucky) for me to find another job that will match up to what I'm getting now.

I know I'm too coward to quit my job. Getting rejecting by the companies that I wanted to join and not having success at my current job and looking for jobs, in general, is making me have some confidence issue. My husband got a good chunk of raises 2 years in a row. Now he's about to switch to another company. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for him. However, looking at myself, my current situation, I just feel even more depressed and worthless.

How can I make myself feel better? Work on myself? How can I rebuild my confidence? Should I just accept that fact that I'm not going anywhere with my career and job stay low since work is work, just something that you put bread on the table?

"Here's my situation: I'm five years out of college and feel like I am completely directionless at the moment. Five years on, I'm still struggling really badly with a lack of consistent purpose and structure in my life, which is something academia offered in spades. I have also become somewhat despondent about certain things in my life; I have been working very hard since leaving college and gotten very little in return.

I'm currently unemployed. I've held a few different jobs since graduating, but pretty much all of them have been bad experiences for one reason or another.

Job 1: low-tier sales job that involved me standing at a booth in a big-box store for at least 8 hours a day harassing customers to try and get them to buy from our kiosk. I was EXTREMELY naive about the working world back then and only took the job because I thought there was more to the position than that. It only took two weeks of people screaming at me to go away before I quit.

Job 2: Worked remotely for a very small digital PR agency for about a year. My official job was media relations (pitching journalists article ideas that would incorporate our clients). Unfortunately because I was remote and had no prior experience in media relations, I learned almost nothing and I was essentially a glorified spammer (in fact I later tried to create an account on a certain well-known news site only to see that my email address had been blacklisted from their database!).

Job 3: Got my first ""real"" job at a PR firm in a different city, 2 years out of college at this point. When I look back at this position, two words come to mind: ""Murphy's Law"". I only worked there for about half a year before being let go for poor performance. During that six month period both my team and I came to realize a few things: I was under-qualified for the position, I didn't fit in culturally with the rest of the team, and to this day I'm pretty sure my direct manager had some sort of personal vendetta against me (bad vibes from her during the interview process, and after being hired I can probably count the number of positive interactions we had on one hand). I don't mean this is a self-righteous way, but I was always a very straight-laced ""straight-A"" kind of student growing up. The idea of someone like me getting fired for poor performance was a MASSIVE blow to my self-esteem and sense of self-worth, and even three years later I am still slightly bitter about the entire experience.

Job 4: My most recent job. Worked at this company for about 1.5 years in their sales department. This was the first job that I didn't hate, and in fact for the first several months I was convinced it was my dream job. However, this was a startup, and I slowly came to realize that while the CEO of the company was quite the talented BS'er, he never put his money where his mouth was, and over time the cracks in the company facade began to reveal themselves. Suffice it to say the place was a massive shitshow, and I'm convinced that the management there cares neither for employees nor their customers, only for cash (I've since spoken to a lot of former customers I know personally who felt the same way). I came into this job feeling extremely passionate about the work, but by the end of my time there I was completely apathetic to the company's success. The company enacted a fairly large round of layoffs at the beginning of this year, and I was one of the casualties of that.

I'd say ever since then, it's almost like I've been in some sort of emotional coma. I've worked and worked and worked and worked and tried to prove myself, but nothing has worked so far, and financially I am no better off today than I was the day I graduated (my bank account has literally never reached five digits lmao).

**Bottom Line:** I don't know where to go from here. I keep seeing people talking about doing informational interviews and trying different positions, but because the last five years of my life have been incredibly volatile with no real payoff whatsoever, I think I'm becoming very gunshy and cynical about branching out and trying new things. My entire academic life I worked hard because of the mantra society chanted at me constantly: ""Work hard, stay in school, get good grades, go to a good college, and you'll get a great, high-paying job."" I did all of those things, except the ""Great, high-paying job"" is nowhere to be found, and there are no clues on how to find it.

I feel stuck because I don't know ""what I want to do for work"" or ""what I'm interested in,"" and feel like I am drowning under the crushing weight of the ambiguity and non-structure of post-graduate life. I do have an 'endgame' goal, which is to get myself into a position that is financially stable enough to where I can still live a comfortable lifestyle while also helping out the rest of my family with emergency expenses, etc. Problem is that I just don't know how to get there.

Any advice anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated. I know this was a long post but it was good to vent. Thanks.","Looking for career direction, feeling completely lost. How do I regain a sense of purpose and direction?",1
"Hello Reddit Community,

I am in a bit of a pickle deciding on a major/field and was hoping if someone could shine some light.

A little bit about my background:

1. Currently working as a Data Analyst intern.
2. Majored in math to challenge myself because most other majors seemed easy and I didn't feel it would do my tuition justice otherwise. Needless to say, it was indeed challenging.
3. Currently doing my MS in stats because I felt it was a nice olive branch away from math and it is widely applicable. 

The conflict arises whenever I think about switching over to a MS in finance. I've always been intrigued in the world of finance. Learning the intricacies of investments such as learning to make your money grow, and helping others do so is interesting to me for some odd reason. Also, in my current job there isn't much interaction with others. I thrive on constant interactions. Brainstorming ideas with others and getting some face to face **ENERGIZES** me. 

Recently at work I bumped into a few investment analyst interns at my work place and I found their work so much more interesting than mine. They're basically learning financial lingo, finding private companies to invest in, and attending investing seminars. I tagged along to their recent private equity seminar and I was hooked.

So my conflict boils down to whether or not I should switch over to a finance MS? My gut says that finishing my stats MS is the best route because it will possibly set me apart and if I land a finance gig then I can just learn everything on the job. Just curious to hear what some of you might have to say. Would truly appreciate any advice. Please and thank you.

The job isn't terribly complicated, but I have to be sure and get every single piece correct every time, or the company could end up with a significant financial cost.

However, our production has recently doubled, and I am now handling 16 cases every day, staying at work for 11-12 hours every day. I am drowning in documents, and there's no end in sight.

My fiancé moved to Atlanta late last year to start his own business, and has been asking me to join him ever since. I agreed, and we planned on me moving down around Fourth of July. However, after looking at the calendar I realized I would be leaving before second quarter bonuses were handed out (about $3,000), and we decided that kind of extra money was worth the wait. Being apart is awful, but $3,000 will go a long long way while I'm looking for a new job.

I'm the companies only sales representative and it's a salaried role with no commission because we supply the oil &amp; gas industry as well as military and these industries take a very dim view of suppliers that pay a sales commission.  
So I have been working at this company for almost a year now and my contract states a fixed payrise at the end of year 1 and another at the end of year 2.

My argument for this is that if I worked for another company in a less niche industry, I would be promoted during that same 8 year period (Area manager, etc.) to a position where I would be earning £50k, but also if (hypothetically) the company went bust in a few years (extremely unlikely) then I wouldn't be able to side-step into a similar role because it's such a niche industry that my experience and knowledge of the products and their applications would be useless, and so I'm taking a risk with my career and I should be compensated for that.

Strengths:

1. Process automation? I love using complex formulas &amp;      basic VBA to make a report that used to require 3 hours into a 5 minute      job. I time myself going different routes to go home, to find the most      optimal way (so sad and funny I do this! haha)

Weaknesses:

1. A bit careless on accuracy. When copying and pasting graphs      into powerpoints… I usually don’t take the time to take a step back and      make sure all formatting/numbers are accurate. My boss always catches them, and its      quite embarrassing. I think there’s      a lack of patience for me as well.
2. Regarding corporate finance, I don’t usually go above      and beyond to “find work” to do when it’s slow… Mostly because I don’t      care about the work.

"I'm currently employed with a small company the hired me 18 months ago after I did some freelance work as a Software Developer. It's a great company with an amazing vision, but still growing. For the most part, I love my job. I get paid very well, especially for the area I live, and work from with a great amount of flexibility. The downside is the benefits are pretty subpar (basically a health plan that I pay half for and nothing else), but I've looked past that because the work is challenging and I have a good boss.

A few days ago, a recruiter for a local company found my resume and contacted me. Since I wasn't really entertaining offers at the time, he asked me a salary that would change me mind, so I quoted him something absurdly higher than what I'm currently making, one that I was certain they'd scoff at). I come to find that they've been trying to fill this position for quite some time and are willing to work with that offer (I'm from a smaller town and there aren't a lot of software developers at my level here).

"  
Hello! The title pretty much says it all, but I’ll elaborate. 

I have a BA in English (no need to roast me - that’s what the holidays are for). Throughout my time at college, my father was struggling with his business and drug addiction. My breaks and summers were spent helping his business and the summer before my senior year helping him through withdrawal. I only bring this up because during college I wasn’t really able to complete an internship or think much about what I wanted to pursue. My father passed away suddenly six months later as I was graduating. After graduation, I had to help my mother close the business. I applied to hundreds of postings that never got back to me and I ended up taking a temp job. 

Since then I’ve moved twice and have just been working temp and entry level customer services/administrative jobs. I struggled significantly with depression during this time. It wasn’t until last year that I was able to get my head above water and to begin to imagine a future where I could be happy and useful. 

I live in Minneapolis-St. Paul now and am still temping. I’ve had three temp jobs here and they weren’t good placements (large number of employees quitting all at once, constant restructuring, getting shutdown with questions of possible advancement). The one I’m at now is awful. It’s at a call center where I get yelled by customers constantly (the worst part is that they are usually getting screwed and I feel pretty bad for them). It’s starting to affect my mental health. 

I’ve spent a lot of time in research, reading career books and asking everyone I meet about their careers. However, I’m still unsure of what to do and I feel like I haven’t found good advice for someone in my position. The advice either targets at new grads or people who have been in the workforce for a while and are switching careers (so they had a successful career once). Also, it’s a lot of - Learn to code! Go back to school! Pick a company and work your way up. Become a paralegal. Have you thought of trade school? Become an ESL teacher and travel! 

These are all good suggestions but I’m overwhelmed and don’t know how realistic they are. I'm lucky enough to not have student debt but don't make enough to be able to save much. When I look at job postings, I get overwhelmed and feel ashamed that I feel like I don’t have any skills. 

At this point, I’m still applying to job postings and rarely hear back. I want to go to networking events but am really embarrassed by my work history and current job. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

Any advice?

"I'm 25m, living with parents (this is normal at my age in the UK).

I'm looking at moving out and since I have no strings (single and not particuarly family orientated) I can pretty much move where I like. The place I'm planning on moving to is several hours from my family home meaning I'll need a new job.

I've been updating my CV/resume however I've realised I'm not even sure I want to stay in the same field of work.

**Bit of background:**

I achieved reasonable grades at school, college and university however I feel like i almost 'cheated the system' by taking easy subjects. I learnt *how* to answer essays and revise for exams as opposed to actually being smart. Everything I learnt was simply for the test and then immediately wiped from my memory. I didn't pick up any skills for the real world. My degree was sports development - a BS degree that means nothing in the real world.

When I graduated, I blagged my way into a low paying marketing and events assistant internship for a large fitness manufacturer. Hated it but completed the 9 month placement.

This put me off marketing and full time office work in general. Due to hating my life, I decided to take the easy route and get my confidence back by working for a friend who was store manager of a retailer. I helped him with the website, data entry, social media and pretty basic stuff trying to get the online marketing &amp; presence of them to increase. Their budget is small so I was paid basically minimum wage. I then quit to find a better paid job. I enjoyed this job more for the company/who I worked with more than anything else.

Landed my current job which I do enjoy. I've realised it's not actually what I do that is what I enjoy (in fact i'm finding marketing pretty boring and only been in this industry since graduating so for the last 3 years). I can't see myself staying in this industry forever if I'm bored already after 3 years. I realise I don't enjoy marketing but enjoy where I work (despite being in marketing) because of the great colleagues I have and the general atmosphere/culture in the office. I don't find the role exciting or fulfilling though. It's also not particuarly well paid at £26k a year. Many of my friends started on that amount when they graduated and progressed to £35-40k by now (3 years later). I can't see much career progression here.

I'd like somewhere with better career progression for pay but something I enjoy. The problem is a large part of it for me is who I work with and the general 'feel' of the working environment.

**What role do I want?**

I don't know what suits me, partly because I don't know who I am. Eg:

In certain scenarios I'm great with people, confident, outgoing etc. However in other scenarios you'd describe me as introverted. I can go from one extreme to the other. I have different social groups and some would describe me as the loud, outgoing, extrovert while to the other group they've never seen that side and would describe me as the awkward, timid, silent one. So I don't know if sales/a 'talkative' job is perfect for me or the complete opposite!

However I can tell you for **certain** that:

* I'm not maths/numbers orientated.
* I'm not practical/hands on.
* I'm a fairly good writer (but nothing exceptional; far from William Shakespeare!)
* I like to please people
* I enjoy feeling a sense of accomplishment with my work
* When I enjoy what I do and am motivated, I'm ***really*** motivated! This all comes internally/intrinsically.
* I'm not organised
* I'm not an 'on the spot' thinker but give me time and I come up with creative ideas
* I don't speak very articulately but if you let me put my words to paper, I express myself well
* The simple jobs appeal to me - eg something as simple as a taxi driver however this wouldn't pay enough. I want to be earning £30k very soon with aspirations of earning more over the next few years as I progress
* I'm pretty laid back, simple man
* I enjoy the outdoors, nature, exercise, health, fitness, travel, exploring, adventures
* I'd like some consistency with my work although the occasional change of work isn't a problem however constant change of both tasks and people makes me feel uneasy
* I have adult ADD (like ADHD but without the hyperactivity). You wouldn't notice this yourself if you met me but it means I can be messy, unorganised and sometimes poor with my timekeeping but since I worry I'll be late to places all the time I usually end up giving myself plenty of time and arriving to places excessively early. Quite a good chance I'll forget something though and have to rush home to pick up what I've forgotten due to the ADD.
* I work slowly but focus on every little detail very carefully
* Once I start focusing on a task, I'll ***really*** get into it and focus on it extremely hard. However if there's external distractions I can find this difficult. Once I'm in the zone I can go several hours without talking.
* I hate talking on the phone.
* I like to have a nice work-life balance. Having said that, if I really enjoy what I do I don't find it a chore to work longer hours (always a bonus if the pay is better because of this too).
* I'd say i'm introverted probably. Quite compassionate, friendly and empathetic.
* I take pride when I can see my contribution to a task/project.
* I'm often not good with coming up with new/fresh ideas but find it very easy to review someone else's ideas/thoughts and add to them, critique them, cultivate them, build on and extend on points within them.
* I don't like high pressure environments.
* I don't always like getting told what to do and prefer a more democratic process.
* Despite being reasonably smart, I feel I don't specialise in any particular field. I'm more of a jack of all trades which has made choosing a new career path extremely difficult.","25m, working in marketing, wanting to change jobs but no idea what?",1
"I finished a bachelor in computer science last year, and have been working as a web developer for 4 months.

Quite simply I don't love it at all. I think I always knew being a developer wasn't for me, but was too stubborn and wouldn't quit finishing my degree. However, now working as a developer the prospect that this will be my career is really disheartening. Firstly because I don't believe I have a strong competency in this field,(when comparing myself to others in a similar stage of career, they have a passion and and ability I just don't). Secondly because whilst the salary may be decent compared to other professions it is still capped at whatever the contract is. e.g 60k without room for growth.

I would like to make the move over to Saas sales, as I believe I will be at an advantage due to my tech background which will help me when having conversations with customers. Additionally, I have always enjoyed playing the consultant/advice role which is why I think I would be a good fit.

My concerns are

1. Is sales just blasting out cold calls, and no different to a telemarketer?
2. Are targets actually achievable, meaning is sales skill or luck, do people actually hit the OTE figures advertised in the job posting?
3. Is sales culture very alpha male-dominated, where those who are extroverted and can talk a big game are successful, whilst introverted people are at a disadvantage.
4. Is it cut throat, will a team support new members or is it sink or swim?

To sum up I'd love to hear from people what does it take to be a successful Saas sales professional.",Software developer wanting to change into Saas Sales,1

I'm 29 years old. I just finished an MA in what amounts to political theory with specialization in practical applications to authoritarianism, democratization, and corruption. If you asked me to describe what that is, I would tell you I'm the equivalent to a state-funded, professional revolutionary that works to create plans centered on developing the economy and legal framework in other countries to grow the middle class and trigger a democratic revolution. A more tedious way to say that is I would be most qualified to work at the NED, USAID, the IMF, or World Bank in a programming and/or evaluation capacity with a focus on development. 

As I've sought employment and looked at trying to plan for the coming years, I've stumbled onto the wargaming industry, and I am fascinated. It's something that excites me, and I want to pursue. However, there doesn't seem to be much information about how to get into the industry, career advice, etc. Where you can search many jobs and get those kinds of resources I mostly find postings and not much else. I've put in a few emails to such companies and have sought feedback there.

"A little background: I've worked in my current position for 4 years now. It is the type of job where you tend to jump around from different supervisors depending on the project and where you're needed. Typically, I would have full days of work and be generally busy. That is until I started working under my current boss. 

It started off slow, with the promise that it would pick up. We butted heads slightly in the beginning because our personalities clashed but it wasn't a big deal really. He is the type to micromanage. Anything I do, he has to get his hands on it and tweak it just slightly to make it his way. It has been frustrating and difficult to get used to. 

I've worked for him for 5 months now and things have not gotten better or busier. I show up and get on the internet all day, all while sitting right next to him. I have even told him I am not doing anything and he says ""well I don't know how to explain it to you"" (as a supervisor thats his job right?) I feel like I am losing ground and have no opportunities to advance while working for him. 

Sitting here doing nothing sounds nice in theory but I am miserable. So what do I do? Should I find a new job or find a way to transfer managers?

"Hey there. Not entirely sure this is the right sub or if this is a topic that has been beaten to death (I’m sure it has, and I apologize). But I need advice here. 

I work in dialysis. I often (1-4 times a week) work 16-17 hour shifts that begin at 3:30 am. The work is grueling, nonstop running around in your patient station all day. There’s bleeding, puking, people passing out, convulsing, and sometimes even dying. It’s so hard to make anyone happy. I don’t expect to, I know that life as a dialysis patient is very difficult. I understand that. They’re not the reason I’m exhausted, even.

No matter how hard I work, no matter how good of a job I do, the only things that ever get noticed by management are mistakes. There’s never any compliments, nor praise for your hard work. And even if there is, it’s not backed up with anything of use. The annual raise barely outpaces inflation (if it does at all) generally being within the $0.50 range. I’ve done everything I can to increase my pay as much as possible, by discussing it, taking interviews at competitive companies, and finally taking on a training role in the clinic.

The training role is the highest peak on the totem pole, and until you receive your RN through college, you cannot advance in the company any further. With the insane hours, going to college isn’t a realistic option. Especially with bills, insurance, life needs. And even if that wasn’t the case, I’m so entirely jaded by healthcare that I have no interest in pursuing an RN by now. 

I have developed crippling anxiety and depression. I don’t sleep well at all, and on my days off I hardly have any energy to do anything productive at all. I get food delivered most of the time because I can’t even bring myself to go to the grocery store and cook for myself.


Today a coworker left first thing in the morning because he wasn’t feeling well. And yeah, none of us ever feel well. Everyday everyone is aching, nauseated, exhausted, and on edge from stress. He left. My other coworker overslept (which also happens quite a bit, because it’s 3:30 in the morning), which meant I had 3 technicians workload on my back. I was able to finish everything; and with only about a 7 minute delay from when we normally allow patients onto the floor. I was entirely exhausted within the first hour of my shift. 

By about the 8th hour into my shift, the regional education manager decided today was a good day to do an audit (she did not say she was there for that). After she had completed observing my treatment initiation, she told me there were issues that we would need to discuss in private at a later time. That’s fine, I believe in good safe work practice and have no issue taking constructive criticism. However, no matter what, it is never good enough. My clinic scored a literal 100% on our state audit, and I was personally appraised by the government auditor for outstanding work. But to my bosses, it’s never good enough. 

And I’m just exhausted. I’m sick. Literally. I cried all the way home and fought back vomiting from anxiety. 

I’ve begged for a 10 day-2 week vacation since January. But there’s always a reason why I can’t take it. Even with months advance. Using the PTO that I have accrued from my hours given to them. I work so hard. Every day I work so hard. I do all of the extra work outside of healthcare that my coworkers always avoid. And now, with the training role, they want more. And more. They want me to begin auditing my coworkers every month, on top of all of my duties that already leave me with hardly any downtime as it is. With no sleep. No respect for my well-being, depression and anxiety. 

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t even want to give a 2 weeks notice, but I know burning bridges with this employer is a bad call. I have references from this company from my previous clinic, so i don’t know that it would be the end of the world. Either way, I want out of health care entirely.

I have enough money in my savings to last, comfortably, 3-5 months. 4-7 months if I am frugal. 

I’m really thinking I am ready to pull the trigger, call my boss, and tell her thank you for the time but I am done. Today. 

I just don’t know what to do.

"Hello Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for some title advice here :)

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently an Administrative Assistant at a company that I absolutely adore. We're a year-old startup and this small team is doing some very cool work that I'm proud to be a part of and I've been there about 10 months.

&amp;#x200B;

This week my CEO came to be saying he feels I should get a title change since 'Admin. Assistant' doesn't really address the scope of the work I'm doing and I'm already doing much more work than an admin would usually do.

&amp;#x200B;

He suggested ""Team Happiness and Success"" or something along those lines BUT says he wants me to be the one to decide and is very open to my input.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, while it may be an irrelevant thing in the long run, I am the only woman at my company out of about 17 men.

I want to avoid coming off as silly, having a less serious title than the other ""Front-end devs"" and ""community ambassadors"" with something like ""chief happiness officer"" which frankly sounds like a nothing title. Being the only girl who also is in charge of team ""happiness"" doesn't really give off the same sense of professionalism I'm looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, my boss wants to avoid any kind of ""manager, lead, officer"" suffixes to it since no one else on our team has this and wants to promote a more egalitarian atmosphere (hence why he isn't a fan of ""assistant"" so much).

&amp;#x200B;

So now my issue: How do I come up with my own title that doesn't sound ditzy while also maintaining the relaxed attitude I think they're going for? I want to be taken seriously of course without going outside by CEO's wants. 

Is my worry of coming off like I was given a silly placeholder title valid? Lastly, would this be an appropriate time to ask for a raise as well?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much!","CEO asking my to change title and I get to decide, but not sure where to go??",1

Making a career change is not uncommon. In fact, oftentimes it's totally necessary to pivot careers in order to continue developing your skillset.

However, what's more, terrifying than making a career change itself? How about writing a cover letter that convinces a hiring manager that you're actually capable of making the change and being successful.

"So this has some context. Recently our “coordinator” quit. I was the one chosen to replace the coordinator. However I was told that due to budget reasons I wouldn’t be receiving the title and I got this little sympathy bump on our annual raises as part of my promotion (which was about a third the increase in pay that my predecessor had). So I have all of the responsibilities without the title and less pay.

Now this job still pays pretty well and it’s good experience. But naturally I’m spreading some fingers out to see what other options I have.

"Hi everyone....I hope I’m asking the right place for advice. 

I’m an MBA grad with around 2 years of marketing experience, and marketing has been the area I’ve primarily focused on. 

While getting hands on experience with the field, I’ve realized that marketing isn’t necessarily what I’m passionate about for my career moving forward. 


I’ve had many people advise me on pursuing a career in data analytics, and I believe this is a field where I would feel more fulfilled moving forward, but I have some questions....I’m willing to take some time off from work to focus on gaining the skills and additional education that I need...but I want to do it smartly, in a cost effective and more importantly in a time effective way. I don’t have any delusions that I’ll be making 80k plus right off the bat, and I’m willing to put in the time to grow my resume in an entry level position. 


So I guess here are some of my questions:

1. Is job security and growth in data overhyped or is it truly a good area to focus on in terms of demand moving forward? 

2. What languages/programs are the most important for me to learn? What courses/degrees/programs/certifications can you recommend for me to both actually master these languages/programs and also prove to employers that I have the necessary skills? 
3. What job positions/titles should I consider for an entry level position with growth potential either internally or for other companies? Do you recommend that I apply for these jobs while I’m taking the courses/classes etc? Or am I better off boosting my skills and resume before



I know transitioning to “ a career in data” is very vague, and so are my questions, but any type of advice would be appreciated. I’ve been doing research on this independently but I don’t consider many of the information online unbiased and I think reddit will atleast give me a variety of responses. 


Just some additional info: I’m currently working as a digital marketing coordinator in a position that I dislike and I have no problem moving on from. I have fairly advanced excel skills but other than very limited python/sql and html introductory courses I have no programming background but I have no doubt that I could learn the skills at a reasonable paste if I apply myself and put aside the necessary time.
Again sorry if I posted this in the wrong place and I appreciate any help. Thanks!",advice needed: Transitioning to data,1
"As you'll read in the following message, I applied to work at my dream job back in March. I was given an interview, and then strung along for 3 months. Completely ghosted... So I retaliated in the best way I know how. Names have been changed for anonymity.

Dear Mr. Massey, 

I write to you today so that you will have a clear understanding as to why I have decided to pass up the 2 employment offers I have received from ACME. It is with great disappointment and frustration that I must even write this message, but I sincerely hope that it serves as a spark for change and thus improvement in the back-office hiring and managerial processes at ACME.

On April 9th 2018, I received an email from your (former) HR employee, Margaret Jacobs, about ACME’ interest in interviewing me for the East Coast Distributor role that I had applied for a month prior. With enthusiasm, I replied that same day and informed Margaret that I was grateful for the opportunity to speak with her on Thursday April 11th at 1pm. She was late, but Margaret and I had our call, and afterwards I sent a thank you card.  Despite my attempts to follow up, I did not hear back, at which point I called again and she informed me that she had lost my application and her notes from our call, but would reach out to James to see if he wanted to invite me back for a 2nd interview.  This was on April 19th, when she said she would call me that day with James’s answer. I did not receive a call, but rather an email the following week, at which point Margaret invited me to have a Skype interview with James on April 26 that 12pm EST.

There was a scheduling conflict on April 26th, so the meeting was moved to 12pm EST on April 30th. I signed into Skype and prepared for my call with James, for which he was 17 minutes late because Margaret had evidently double booked his calendar. We spoke for over an hour and a half. I felt the interview went very well and sent a thank you card the next day.

As of May 7th, I had not heard anything from ACME and decided to email James for an update. The following day, Margaret responded and informed me that she and James would like me to meet with the rest of the sales team (Kathy and Lucas) for a third interview. I happily obliged. May 9th, 5:30pm EST.

On May 9th, I logged into Skype for the interview, at which point Kat and Lucas had trouble with the video/audio conferencing equipment and we ultimately decided that speaking over the phone would have to suffice. Despite the technological troubles, the three of us had what I felt was an incredible interview, and built a lot of rapport. I sent 2 thank you cards the following day. Kat and Lucas are great people.

May 14th, I’m contacted by Margaret with an offer for an in person interview with you and James at the HQ in Los Angeles. The dates were not yet set, and she said she’d get back to me with confirmation.

May 15th, Margaret emails me to tell me I’ll need to be in Los Angeles, in 5 days. No mention of flight or hotel. She had forgotten that I was located in South Carolina. After a gentle reminder from me, she said she would work on flight and hotel itinerary. 

May 17th (Friday): I still had received nothing from Margaret, but I was supposed to interview in 3 days, so I took a proactive approach, called the front desk and spoke to a young man who then linked me up with Ashley Poland, who is amazing, and got my flights booked in an hour. I received the itinerary and scheduled to take 2 days of PTO at my current employer

May 20th (Monday): You and I sat in the boardroom and had my fourth interview. Afterwards, I went to lunch with James and Lucas. Everything seemed to be going smoothly. After lunch, I was asked to have a seat in the front office room for “20 minutes” while James had a conference call.   TWO HOURS later, I was gathered from the office room, and given a brief tour of the facilities. After which, I said my farewell’s and headed to the hotel for a quick nap before my 5am flight back to the East Coast. 

May 28th (Tuesday- 8 days later): No update. I email Margaret. Her response “I will try to have an update for you tomorrow.”

June 7th (18 total days later): Still no update whatsoever. So I called. No answer. Sent email. Her response “We are finalizing things right now. I will phone or email you before end of day with update”

June 12th (23 total days since interview): Email from James. “ACME would like to move forward and bring you on the team. We will reach out in the next day or two”

June 14th (Friday- 25 days since 4th interview):  I received the first offer letter. The job was now listed as WEST Coast Street Dealer Development. My name was spelled incorrectly. The Salary was over $30K less than what we had previously discussed. Only a 4 month trial period despite the requirement of moving across the country. The start date was set for July 1st (14 days, again…I’d have to move across the country). After nearly a month of patience on my end, Margaret said I needed to respond with an acceptance that same day – which I feel is completely unreasonable.

June 17th (Monday): I spoke with Margaret and told her that I wasn’t yet ready to decide with the information at hand, and there were still many outstanding questions and details that I wanted beforehand.

June 18th: I get a phone call from James stating that Margaret made a mistake, sent the wrong offer letter and that she had been removed from the company. He would be the new direct point of contact and to call him with anything I needed.  He said I would be receiving a revised offer letter in the next day or two.

June 25th (Tuesday - 7 days later): I received the 2nd offer letter: This time, job is now EAST coast Off-road, salary is still pitiful (absolute bottom of the range advertised to me by James). NO details whatsoever on 401k, Insurance carrier/network, travel assistance, HMO benefits, sales quota, performance review, training, expectations etc.  Start date: July 8th (13 days – so not even enough to submit a 2 weeks-notice with my current employer.)

I replied to James in an email and wrote out about a dozen questions that I’d like answers to before moving forward. His response via a text: “I’m in Italy. Give me a couple days”. Those couple days turned into much longer because he was off on vacation the following week. 

I have since called James, my potential manager, 5 times. Not one response. I have called the front desk to leave a message for him 4 times. The very helpful receptionist has told me she sent him an email, to which he has not responded at all.

So that brings us here, at the end of a very long letter, the end of a journey, on July 9th.  Precisely 3 MONTHS after my initial contact from Margaret. I have spent hours and hours pursuing this dream of working for ACME. Praying for the stars to align. I’ve sacrificed multiple days of work at my current employer to pursue a long career at ACME. I’ve acted professional, patient, and polite despite the obstacles put in front of me. 

However, due to a sheer lack of communication and overall poor professional etiquette, I will not be accepting either of the two current employment offers, and will look to pursue other opportunities elsewhere. I hope this letter serves as a foundation for improvement so that capable, passionate, driven individuals are not mistreated in the future. 

Thank you for your time during the interview, and for reading this letter.

"Hello internet,

My dream has been to do real estate, however I live in a rural market that is overrun with them. Thoughts? Does anyone have experience being a RE agent in a rural area?",Leaving finance to pursue my dream of being a real estate agent in a flooded market,1
"I'm 25m, living with parents (this is normal at my age in the UK).

I'm looking at moving out and since I have no strings (single and not particuarly family orientated) I can pretty much move where I like. The place I'm planning on moving to is several hours from my family home meaning I'll need a new job.

I've been updating my CV/resume however I've realised I'm not even sure I want to stay in the same field of work.

**Bit of background:**

I achieved reasonable grades at school, college and university however I feel like i almost 'cheated the system' by taking easy subjects. I learnt *how* to answer essays and revise for exams as opposed to actually being smart. Everything I learnt was simply for the test and then immediately wiped from my memory. I didn't pick up any skills for the real world. My degree was sports development - a BS degree that means nothing in the real world.

When I graduated, I blagged my way into a low paying marketing and events assistant internship for a large fitness manufacturer. Hated it but completed the 9 month placement.

This put me off marketing and full time office work in general. Due to hating my life, I decided to take the easy route and get my confidence back by working for a friend who was store manager of a retailer. I helped him with the website, data entry, social media and pretty basic stuff trying to get the online marketing &amp;amp; presence of them to increase. Their budget is small so I was paid basically minimum wage. I then quit to find a better paid job. I enjoyed this job more for the company/who I worked with more than anything else.

Landed my current job which I do enjoy. I've realised it's not actually what I do that is what I enjoy (in fact i'm finding marketing pretty boring and only been in this industry since graduating so for the last 3 years). I can't see myself staying in this industry forever if I'm bored already after 3 years. I realise I don't enjoy marketing but enjoy where I work (despite being in marketing) because of the great colleagues I have and the general atmosphere/culture in the office. I don't find the role exciting or fulfilling though. It's also not particuarly well paid at £26k a year. Many of my friends started on that amount when they graduated and progressed to £35-40k by now (3 years later). I can't see much career progression here.

I'd like somewhere with better career progression for pay but something I enjoy. The problem is a large part of it for me is who I work with and the general 'feel' of the working environment.

**What role do I want?**

I don't know what suits me, partly because I don't know who I am. Eg:

In certain scenarios I'm great with people, confident, outgoing etc. However in other scenarios you'd describe me as introverted. I can go from one extreme to the other. I have different social groups and some would describe me as the loud, outgoing, extrovert while to the other group they've never seen that side and would describe me as the awkward, timid, silent one. So I don't know if sales/a 'talkative' job is perfect for me or the complete opposite!

However I can tell you for **certain** that:

* I'm not maths/numbers orientated.
* I'm not practical/hands on.
* I'm a fairly good writer (but nothing exceptional; far from William Shakespeare!)
* I like to please people
* I enjoy feeling a sense of accomplishment with my work
* When I enjoy what I do and am motivated, I'm ***really*** motivated! This all comes internally/intrinsically.
* I'm not organised
* I'm not an 'on the spot' thinker but give me time and I come up with creative ideas
* I don't speak very articulately but if you let me put my words to paper, I express myself well
* The simple jobs appeal to me - eg something as simple as a taxi driver however this wouldn't pay enough. I want to be earning £30k very soon with aspirations of earning more over the next few years as I progress
* I'm pretty laid back, simple man
* I enjoy the outdoors, nature, exercise, health, fitness, travel, exploring, adventures
* I'd like some consistency with my work although the occasional change of work isn't a problem however constant change of both tasks and people makes me feel uneasy
* I have adult ADD (like ADHD but without the hyperactivity). You wouldn't notice this yourself if you met me but it means I can be messy, unorganised and sometimes poor with my timekeeping but since I worry I'll be late to places all the time I usually end up giving myself plenty of time and arriving to places excessively early. Quite a good chance I'll forget something though and have to rush home to pick up what I've forgotten due to the ADD.
* I work slowly but focus on every little detail very carefully
* Once I start focusing on a task, I'll ***really*** get into it and focus on it extremely hard. However if there's external distractions I can find this difficult. Once I'm in the zone I can go several hours without talking.
* I hate talking on the phone.
* I like to have a nice work-life balance. Having said that, if I really enjoy what I do I don't find it a chore to work longer hours (always a bonus if the pay is better because of this too).
* I'd say i'm introverted probably. Quite compassionate, friendly and empathetic.
* I take pride when I can see my contribution to a task/project.
* I'm often not good with coming up with new/fresh ideas but find it very easy to review someone else's ideas/thoughts and add to them, critique them, cultivate them, build on and extend on points within them.
* I don't like high pressure environments.
* I don't always like getting told what to do and prefer a more democratic process.
* Despite being reasonably smart, I feel I don't specialise in any particular field. I'm more of a jack of all trades which has made choosing a new career path extremely difficult.","25m, working in marketing, wanting to change jobs but no idea what?",1

"So I had a job interview for a medical receptionist job last week and am having a second interview this week to meet the team. A slight problem is that she wants references from old supervisors and managers. This is why it's kind of a problem in my case:

&amp;#x200B;

1. At my first job I held 7 years ago, the location I worked at closed within the last year or so (company itself is still open however). It might be harder to get a hold of my manager specifically but I know they remember me and such there.

&amp;#x200B;

2. The manager when I was a cashier at Target over 4 years ago changed stores and a lot of the team leaders who worked there when I did are no longer with the company. There might be some people there who may remember me however.

&amp;#x200B;

3. My current manager does NOT do references under any circumstances and to be honest things aren't going that great at my current job. The department manager and I are at odds because she and I clash at times. I have quite a few co-workers and former co-workers who would gladly serve as references for me. A couple former team leaders and 1 or 2 current team leaders may be able to do it for me. My floor supervisor might be willing to be a reference for me (afterall, he does go to me for favors frequently and gives me fairly good reviews consistently).

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you Reddit is, what if you can't get a hold of old managers, a current manager and you don't get along the best, or old managers are no longer with a company?

My son is now 26. He has a degree in criminal justice but has no desire to be a cop. Not sure how he ended up in criminal justice, but I think it seemed like an easy degree at the time and he thought he might want to be a state trooper. He has worked in Customer Service for a large industrial supply company, it was ok, but a long commute and no future there. He tried insurance claims, but decided that ""nobody"" respects that job and he didn't like it and it was a lower paying company. I think the pay (which was not great, but not horrible) was part of why he felt he was better than the job. Moved on to a recruiting/staffing company. Liked it,hated it, liked it again briefly when he got a high paying job filled, now hates it again more than ever. He is recruiting in a highly competitive career segment where not a lot of people are looking to switch careers and finding qualified peopled is tough, plus he is not educated in the field, except for learning as he is placing people. Another agency would mean a ridiculous commute...

His gf is a nurse and makes good $. Everyone he knows loves their job and he feels like he should love his. He is ready to walk out. Looks for job while he's at work. He just doesn't want to do this job. He wants a social services job, but it's not his degree and he never even gets called. He says he'll join the military, but I know too many people who did that, and it doesn't really get them a job unless it's in a field where they were educated for anyway.

Has been with gf for 3 years and I love them together. I don't want him to throw everything away. I don't know how to help him and know that I really can't. But he texts me and I get sick to my stomach with worry for him making a mistake he will regret. He doesn't really TALK to me about anything usually, I'm still the mom who doesn't know anything and just wants to be in his business. Yet he texts me with this. I think because he knows I am always there for him and he can't whine to his friends the way he can to mom.

I just don't know how to help or how to not get sick to my stomach.

I do this because illustration pays so damn low that I have to take on multiple projects in order to make a decent living so it’s taking a toll on my health. And yes I do run, I take my dog on a walk every single day! But today was the last straw. I can’t sit down and I can’t stand up! My back it’s completely busted. I am so fucking scared. I had lower back pain before but never like this! I literally cannot fucking sit down anymore. And if I walk I feel that my body is going to crumble into the floor because my legs are so fucking weak. I am even scared to ever draw again anymore because it feels as if I won’t be able to walk again. This hurts so fucking much and I cant feel my legs at times. Today and tomorrow I have to meet two deadlines and I won’t be able to fulfill the responsibilities because I can’t stand up or sit down! I swear to god. I don’t know what to do.

"Hey guys,

Reddit is quite amazing. This sub has many experienced robotics engineers and researchers. And I really want your advice, people...

**TL;DR:** ***Joining a robotics research lab soon as a masters student. Will be spending at least 2.5 years here.***

***The question is: Name 3 things you feel a person should possess if he/she were to found a robotics start-up after they graduate?***

***(where just having theoretical knowledge/publications is not enough).***

I will be joining a robotics research lab soon as an MS by research student. This lab has a heavy focus on research on perception and motion planning, submits papers to top conferences like ACC, IROS, and ICRA and has really really amazing folks here. I'm glad I would be among these people. But when it comes to implementing on real robots, it is not in par (at least I feel that way).

Which is okay and understandable because it is hard to focus on both research and implementation. But I like the intersection of research and engineering. As in, I should be able to efficiently implement algorithms that I might come up with during this period, able to debug(I always feel I'm not good at debugging codes/packages). I feel that's where I want to be. Basically, I want my research to be reproducible and implementable into real-life scenarios

(and not sit in some Github repo catching dust :P)

So, assuming I won't burn out trying to be this person(which is most probably why people don't try to be like this) and besides doing the generic stuff like taking course work and trying to publish to conferences and journals, what are the other things I should focus on?

How should I be different from the average researcher?

What other skills should I practice to be able to get my ideas into working prototypes?

My background is in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I like getting my hands dirty with hardware. And I wish to make a career in what I like. Too much to ask?

Management may recklessly yelling at others assuming fault is on them, the next day they admit the discrepancy is on their side and their manner seems nothing happen. I personally feel yelling can only bring process negative and inefficient

Bad communication

I'm a 25 year old male. 2 things I care deeply about are:

1. Self improvement/personal development/self growth - Looking after myself now will improve the quality of my life in future.
2. Being determined to make the most money possible

However, over the last few years I've done a **lot** of travelling including visiting Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Malaysia, The Philippines, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Albania, Macedonia and Turkey. I've also done a lot of research on visiting countries like Nicaragua, Guatemala, Colombia etc. I love travelling to explore different cultures, ways of life, and explore how other people live and go about their ways of life. I love the authentic non-touristic route and have met some amazing, genuinely lovely people from many developing and third world countries.

One thing I've found is that these people are extremely happy with their life that many of us here would find very basic. They often come from small villages with a simple way of life but a big community atmosphere and spirit within society.

Now back in the UK I've been brought up by my parents to get a good education, work extremely hard through school/college and then continue to work hard in my career now that I'm working full time. However I've realised I prefer to ""work to live"" as opposed to ""live to work"".

"Hello everybody. 

So I'll start with my situation. I am a male and 25, have a bachelor's in finance. Here's my problem, I recently was working as an accountant/financial analyst at a construction company but was laid off. Through my job search I have recently been offered a position for a project accountant position for a construction company based in Arizona. From the research I've done about the company and the people that work there are awesome. They're willing to give me a relocation bonus for moving as well. My problem is I don't know a soul in Arizona so there is no support system and don't really have the long term career ambition to work as a project accountant or in the construction. My long term goal is to get an MBA while working full time in an industry like energy, banking, or financial services (or after I graduate with an MBA I can get into these industries). So long term this project accountant job in Arizona doesn't really align with my ambition to break into the energy, banking, or financial services industries. And  I also think if I take the job I will have to probably put off getting an MBA. I currently live in a large city in Texas were there is plenty of opportunity to probably get a full time job if I keep applying. Right now I have plenty of money to live off of so that isn't really a concern. The position in Arizona wouldn't be much in a difference in pay from my old job, however the company is awesome and the culture is awesome and they really want people who work there to succeed. So  I have 2 scenarios I can run by you guys: 1.) Move to Arizona, work for a awesome company with great culture and people, gain experience, and a small (if not the same pay as my previous job, difference is only like $2000 but after expenses if I lived in AZ it only comes out to me net pay like $500 a month take home money), but not in the industry I want to be in, in a city where I do not know anyone, and delay my pursuit of gaining an MBA. Or 2.) Continue to stay in my city where there is plenty of opportunity and where I can probably find a job if I keep applying and apply more heavily to the energy, banking, and financial services positions and pursue my MBA in Jan. 2020.

As for my service, I am most likely going to do my 20 years retire pending a possibility of getting comissioned, in which case I might stay longer. My questions are for any career advisors or anybody that works with one of these degrees listed.

" 

Hi everyone, I'm a foreigner who graduated from a US college, and currently working in a company on my OPT. I have completed one year of OPT. Over this period, I have been assigned significant tasks and responsibilities that were not first mentioned in my job description. Part of it is because I am the kind of person who loves to take in new task and always the first to take on the responsibility. At one point I realized I am being paid significantly low to what I should for the area I am in. Hence, a month ago I talked to my supervisor and asked him for a raise. He clearly knows that I deserve a raise, and told me he will talk to the CEO and HR. Two weeks went by and I still didn't hear anything from him, so I asked him again and he said he's working on it with HR. Another week went by and I haven't heard anything from him. I was getting frustrated at this point, and started looking for other jobs. When few recruiters contacted me, they offered me jobs that will easily pay 6 figures ( more than 50% to what I am being paid). However, being an international student and requiring sponsorship, these recruiters would have a hard time to place me. Going back to my supervisor, about 10 days ago, when I was in his office, he randomly told me, ""By the way, I haven't brought up the raise to you recently because I am discussing your sponsorship with HR and talking to lawyers,"" I was really happy because sponsorship for me is more important than raise right now. He said he looked up few things online and found out about sponsorship. Me being someone who has researched a lot on that topic, told him I would email him everything I know about it and that night I wrote a long email and sent it to him.

It's been 10 days since then and he hasn't responded to my email, or he doesn't bring it up to me in person as well. I know my supervisor is a nice person and he keeps things to himself most the times. However, I'm concerned if they are actually going to sponsor me and give me a raise or is it just some trick for them to buy some time so I keep on working until they find someone else.

Please advice what to do! Should I talk to him again or wait?

That was on Monday and it has been radio silence since.  I sent a brief follow up note yesterday to the director with no response.

Is it normal for the formal offer to take days for state jobs?

But according to what I have read on the net, that will put me into quantative finance territory and I think that would be a very theoretical job for me and I would be bored as it wouldn't be creative enough.

"I work in a digital marketing agency. Currently I am entry level, but I am on a promotion path. The promotion would mean that instead of focusing only on local search marketing I would be able to take accounts that deal with Social Media and Paid Advertising. I already have my google certs for analytics, search marketing, mobile, etc (all that are required for promotion) and have completed every step of the path - except getting past my director to the COO who then interviews and actually promotes.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been on this path for nearly a year, and have some accounts that deal with Social and PPC. These were not given to me, but happened naturally from client's upgrading their packages with us and the relationship I built with them. In normal circumstances these accounts should go to those labeled as ""Digital Marketers"" as opposed to ""Local Search Marketers""(me), but the clients requested that I stay on the account for each one that I have. There are a few that I have transferred to other strategists in the company. My manager allowed me to keep them as ""practice"" since I was on the path.

&amp;#x200B;

These accounts are just over 10% of my monthly work, the other 90% is housed under my actual job title. I believe I'm ready for promotion, but this is my 4th meeting with the director to determine if I can move up in my path.  


Now that some background has contextualized the situation, here are my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

\-assuming I do not get the promotion, is it reasonable to request that I have the PPC and Social plans transferred to an appropriately qualified strategist within the company? Part of me wants to do this and find other work if I continue to be discouraged and turned away. However, another part of me says I should be a team player and keep these accounts. It's not about the workload (they are easy accounts), it's about the principle of the matter for me. How is the company not confident enough to promote me, yet confident enough to allow me to carry a 10% load that is not part of my job title? 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Should I push back and argue that I've had these accounts for nearly the entire time I've been on the ""path""? What's an appropriate and professional level of push back?

&amp;#x200B;

\- If I am not promoted, should I inform the director (or immediate manager) that this is a setback for me, and I'm considering finding other work where I can hire in for the title they won't promote me to (I have a year experience with Ad and Social accounts plus my certs)?

I've been working in the same industry for 5 years now. I've worked my way up from receptionist to office administrator, then service manager (repair shop) and now operations manager. I've always worn multiple hats and tried to be a pillar wherever I've worked. I have no formal education (some college classes) or training but I've worked with great people who have let me ask lots of questions and take on responsibilities despite that. I've now worked for 2 different shops. The first was acquired by a larger competitor (apparently the owner had some unresolved issues and it was a means to save his own ass, not that the branch was failing). It was a small office and I did literally everything. The branch manager there (who I still trust) recruited me to my current company. He took the job for a paycheck after the sale and ultimately left because of how stupid it is. Current company does the exact same thing... repair shop, parts sales, unit sales, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been at my current company for almost 2 years. I've dealt with sexism and jealousy from the start. Most of the guys refused to acknowledge my prior experience and were hostile about upper management including me or giving me more responsibility. Long story short, I can do everyone's job in the branch I am now. The weight of the branch was on my shoulders even though we have a branch manager. 

So, one day I was out meeting with a customer and they jokingly asked if I wanted a job. To their surprise, I said yes. They presented a good offer - less money/hour but would get overtime and cheaper insurance. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I finally gave my notice, shit hit the fan. The owner and VP came down the next morning and we discussed what I'd need to stay. They basically gave me everything I asked for without hesitation. I struggled to decide what to do and the VP assured me that she and I would basically run the show. Unfortunately, she works in our second location the attitudes and behavior at my location just got worse. They were mad I was reporting to the VP, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

The customer that offered the new position tried for months to get me back and we stayed friendly.  Things at my current job seemed okay enough to ride it out...but stupid shit just got worse and worse. Fast forward 5 months and I end up in the hospital for mental health issues. I do believe my experience where I am contributed to the hospitalization and I'm still out on leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

I texted the customer today to see if they were still looking (as it was still posted) and he said they JUST filled it. I'm really disappointed but they have the same openings in different cities (they expect certain applicants to be open to relocation anyway).  There is a clear path for advancement too. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question: should I ask if my contact here if can /would help me apply for the position in other cities? Does it seem desperate and tacky? I'm concerned I've burned a bridge with the company (not as my customer) since I'd already interviewed with the VP and President for the former position. But, my varied experience is exactly what they're looking for and they seemed to understand why I stayed. I do believe the culture and structure is worth the investment since I know of someone who has done well with them. 

I just did the job search on a whim. Turns out they have a few spots open in major cities I’d already been researching. I have been looking to relocate for a few months.

Hi there,

I started with my company 9 months ago basically as a junior PM at a software company within their professional services division. In March, my boss went MIA on medical leave + I have taken over much of her work.

Well, boss came back &amp; put in their notice. Since it is just us 2 on the PMO team, I was offered Manager of PMO and I will hire on someone else to takeover my initial job.

Currently @ $71,500 - no direct reports, pretty much doing everything my boss does except revenue. In her absence, my workload has been crazy, and expected to continue til i hire help. * My boss - older, more experienced... is at 125k. * they offered me 80k for the promotion

They offered me a 11-12% pay increase, for the following reasons: * I am a bit junior + will involve some investment from the company * I won't be taking on all of my bosses activities immediately [not until I have someone hired &amp; ramped up will i take on month end/ finance items] * I would get a good title bump [Mgr of PMO] * they said it is hard to get any large pay bump -- I think this is why people typically switch companies though - once they know your base pay, they know any jump is better than none; moving companies you have more leverage.

Knowing my boss makes 125k and me currently doing 85% of the same work + will do 100% of the same work, i guess i was expecting more than 80k.
Obviously i'm not expecting 125k like my boss had, but they are still saving money even if i got 100k.

Hi everyone! Any opinion or suggestions are welcome as I am kind of lost.

I am a 27 F living in Chicago suburbs. Right now I have a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and have 2 years of working as a System Administrator. I also have 2 years working as a Marketing Coordinator.

I am 100% miserable in my current field. After much consideration, I have decided I really want to work for a record company or be somehow involved in the music industry. I really enjoyed the Marketing aspects of the job I had while I worked as a coordinator. Since I was a child I have been obsessed with the industry. I also play a few instruments myself. This is something I have heavily researched and thought about a lot and is my passion.

Ideally, I would love to work as a Fan Engagement Coordinator, Marketing Manager, A&amp; R or Artist Development Manager. My problem is I've applied to probably over 200 positions total at this point at Sony, Warner and Universal with no response back. I've even applied for more entry-level clerical positions to get my foot in the door. Most of the IT positions are higher up and I am not qualified. I have applied to some smaller record companies as well.

I know this is the path I want to pursue and I live in Chicago and it seems like a dead end here. I would be willing to relocate to Los Angeles or Nashville depending on what type of job I could find out there that could afford me to live. It would need to be more than 55k a year.

Here are my potential options/paths. Please let me know what you think of them

Option 1

Go back to school at UCLA in their extension program and receive a certificate in Music Business. This certificate also places you in an internship program as well and classes are online and on campus. The classes are at night so I would be able to work during the day. The certificate is around $7,000 and about a year to do. I would try and find work out there in the meantime or possibly another remote IT position to keep myself afloat if I decided to move to Los Angeles.

Option 2

Online classes for a certificate in Music Business or a Masters of Arts in Music Business degree at Berklee online. This would allow me to continue to live and job hunt where I am right now. My only concern with this is there's no internship placement. Which I think is how you get your foot in the door at most of these record companies.

Option 3

Continue to exhaust myself and apply for any and every position at these companies. Maybe find another marketing position work there for a few years and try and still get my foot in the door. The issue is the lack of education and internship. This is probably the most cost-effective option. Most people suggested to get their foot in the door through IT but like I said I am not qualified for most of the positions listed and am completely burnt out in this field.

I feel like I've done a great job, and have gotten that feedback internally, and have tangible, significant results. 

Exciting, right? Except I have a bad taste in my mouth. Since my contract period started, they've hired seven people that did not start as contractors (I've overheard benefits conversations; small office). The majority of these people have the same or higher level title than I do. 

They also hired someone with the same title, working on a different side of the business, who has 1/3 the experience I do and per the job description I saw, makes at least $30k more than I do.

i graduated from a pretty good university with degrees in computer science and music and i'm at a loss of what to do now. some background info: i was an average student but computer science really took a toll on me. at first i really enjoyed music and i thought computer science was an interesting. as i ran out of time to choose a major i ended up with the computer science as a double major. then classes started getting more difficult and on top of academics i was having some pretty terrible mental breakdowns throughout the day (practicing music, studying, trying to finish those coding assignments). this made studying very challenging and i managed to get B's, C's, and the occasional D and F (which i had to retake the course for and did better). i was told by an advisor that i should look into another field, but by that time it was too late to research another field and graduate within 4 years (i needed to financially) but i ended up ignoring them and finished out the major. but this interaction, not being able to concentrate/find joy in coding/studying computer science (and music - am struggling to pick up my instrument each day), and not doing well in classes has made me burnt out and i'm thinking about staying away from tech for awhile. i've applied to computer science-related jobs and got to the interviews but my lack of experience, bad grades, and my struggling with technical interviews has not gotten me anywhere. i know i can be learning on my own and studying on my own, especially with the technical interviews, but i'm at the point where i try to read the screen and think and my brain goes ""blank"". i'm not sure what i'm good at anymore and i'm not sure what i want to do instead of tech. i'm researching my options but so far nothing has stuck out. i do need a job and so i'm ok with not 100% liking it, but i don't want to be miserable.

I get yelled at on an almost nightly basis for shit that I have no control over, and while for most people I'm sure it's manageable, when you already have depression, it becomes a significant amplifier.

"So I'm in my later 20s.  Excuse me f I sound stupid, it's probably because I am and could use some mentorship from someone wiser than me.  
I have two years of college, hopped around a lot of close to minimum wage jobs, hopped around online work, and generally don't have a set career path.  It's not like I never had one.  I did well in school, had scholarships, and was really focused at one point but then had personal things happen that kind of derailed me from that track.

 I'm somehow still surviving, mostly thanks to the fact that I have people who help me and care for me, but I know that's a rug that can be pulled from under my feet at any time yet seem to still not be taking that fact seriously not knowing what to do.  

I've known the real world isn't easy...and even minimum wage jobs can come with toxic environments which I have experienced plenty enough of, and it's true for bigger places too, right.  People will throw you down when they can. You need tough skin, and to be somewhat assertive and aggressive, to be quick on your feet for this world.

It hit me like a ton of bricks and really makes me feel like I don't have the same grit to make it in this world. Those people are cut from a different cloth and just seem so predatory.

I can respect that they play the game to make money, even if it means being somewhat sleazy, fake, passive aggressive, stepping on others.  Is it alright that I am not that way? Am I just destined to be poor the rest of my life if I don't play that way?    
Is there actually any career in this world that won't make you feel so slimy? Where you don't have to be so pushy? Where you can actually be more authentic? Or am I naive to think that exists anywhere?

Hello,

I have to deal with a very important decision this summer : should I go to Denmark DTU and study for a Master's degree in Applied Chemistry or stay in my current job as QA Engineer in tobacco company. I would like some help from you to make this decision and Im going to provide some more context.

•I have graduated a year ago in Chemical Technology and Engineering •I started working in the corporation as I was finishing my thesis - 1.3 yrs now. •I am really valued there - I am sent to most trips and events that lab technicians shouldn't. • I have been just promoted to Engineer • It pays well compared to other jobs in my country •I don't like the city my company is located in • My degree is almost useless there- no chemical knowledge or skills are required there. It is mostly MS office and managerial, communication, project leading skills •I feel if I continue like this I will totally drift apart from my engineering field and chemistry and become a full on manager/soft skills person • There are not a lot of places for chemists/ chemical engineers in Lithuania • I dont hate my job, but it is hard to like it because I feel like i chose the wrong speciality (or wrong job) • Important thing - I plan to return to my country if I go study in Denmark •I want to improve my chemical knowledge there and maybe branch to pharmacy/biotechnology so it would be easier to get a job when I return •I want new experiences and connections there • I want to move to another city when I come back (not where I currently am with E-corp)

Basically : I stay in my current job because Im lost and it pays well, but a worm is eating me because I dont like the city Im in and I don't like that Im wasting my engineering/chemical skills.

Job 1 is in the accounting department for a hotel, M-F, 8am-5pm.... $16/hr. I've wanted a hotel accounting position for quite awhile but never had the opportunity to do so. I interviewed once before for one and never got it. I now have a SECOND job offer... front desk manager... 50k... no set schedule, would work weekends. I'd be back at the desk, managing agents... and it just sounds dreadful.

My thing with the accounting department position is I think it would look great and if I work hard enough I could see myself getting promoted to assistant director of finance in maybe two years? But I did the math and I would be bare bones barely surviving with the $16/hr accounting job... but I think with the 50k job I would be hating my life working 10 hours a day standing at the front desk dealing with agents and guests.... and no real upward mobility path.

"I come to reddit after a long phone call I had with a close friend of mine. She is at a fairly senior position in tech at a bank in North America. She got hired there after being promised that she would be the only person at her level and thus have the scope to do the work she wanted to do. Her previous job was as a consultant, which was busy but in a stressful way where sometimes you would not have a project.

Anyway, recently her current manager at the bank said that she wanted to promote another member on her team to the same level as my friend. This goes against the deal and agreement that was made when my friend originally joined the company, not to mention it would split her role so that her ownership is now shared - she won't have the authority to make decisions that she is competent to do. Secondly the person being promoted does not have the technical capability that my friend does. My friend has made a list of all the reasons that she does not support this organizational strategy decision being made by her manager and will talk to her about it on Monday, however, I get the feeling it will be ignored and my friend will get told she is jealous or something. My friend has tried making allies at her company among folks who are higher than her manager, but she is finding that for the most part, they don't take any action to support her either.  


My friend has also considered mentioning that if this other member is promoted to her level, my friend should get some advantageous benefit as well - can shift a job role she does not want to build skills in to someone else, something else etc. Finding something to ask for that would be worth it seems difficult since it feels like such a personal attack.   


I had no idea what advice to give her as I have never been in such a situation myself. She is most certainly more ambitious than I am and values being good at her job and her reputation for it. Does anyone have any insights? She deserves to be valued and respected for her skills, but right now it just feels like bullying.",Career trouble for a friend of mine,1
"Currently a Operations Manager in manufacturing. I'm getting the job done, continuously making operational improvements and getting pay raises along the way. Management is happy with my deliverables. However I'm not at the level of pay I want to be. Currently @ 82.5k a year with a 5k yearly bonus (seems to be above average).

 I really want to be at 125k a year. I don't think my current title warrants such a pay. I'm assuming a Director of Ops. or VP  of OPs is more in that scope.

Six Sigma, from what I've learned so far, is essential to running a lean operation or at least getting a job title to do so. From my limited research, it appears that I already logically solve problems in a way that encompasses the foundation of Six Sigma but not to the same mathematical degree. My question is, will six sigma be required for my next leap? If I want to be either internally promoted to a higher level or jump ship to another company for higher pay, will they be looking for that certificate? Does experience trump all or does that Six Sigma certificate really shine through? I suppose the answer will vary to each company. Those who have Six Sigma training(any belt), has it really benefitted your deliverables and pay?

 Any advice really would be helpful as I am always worried about my future and income. Thanks.",Six Sigma needed if you are heavily experienced? and other advice needed.,1

"I'm a 29 year old software engineer working for a multinational company in the North of England and I've specialised in an almost-extinct language and architecture, supporting ancient equipment that helps to run a highly technical customer system. I'm currently earning about £43k and I'm coming up for a promotion within the next year.

How can I work out a reasonable salary requirement for that promotion?

I've worked with this language with two employers for the last 7 years. As far as I can tell, there are only 3 employers worldwide who care about this language (another contractor and the customer) and I wouldn't want to move to any of the others. I'm one of 3 experienced people still left in my company and the only one who won't retire in the next 5 years - we're looking at keeping this kit going until potentially 2040. We've really struggled to hire others to do this job and noone wants to stick around to learn to use these pre-Unix ancient legacy machines.

A few points I'm thinking of: 

 • this highly specialist skill is basically unmarketable to other employers, but I could transfer to other legacy technologies and industries (such as COBOL) without too much difficulty. 

 • I am the only future this lucrative long term contract currently has. 

 • I'm potentially hobbling my CV by working on this equipment and not getting modern software experience - I'm potentially trapped here.

 • I enjoy what I do and want to keep doing it.

"I've been at a company for about 6 months. Our team consists of about ten people all having the same duties and title. We all know that the company is growing fast and it's expected that the team will gain new hires. I recently ran across one of the hiring ads online and was surprised to see my exact job listed at a higher rate - about 11% more per hour. I'm positive that it includes both the same title and duties - I compared it to my original listing, which I saved. I saw these ads on both my company website and also to major boards like Indeed.com, if that matters. 

One of my current coworkers recently approached me asking what my hourly rate was - apparently she also noticed the ads. She had questioned others too and the consensus is that all of us ""old"" employees are all making the same hourly, lower rate. No one is sure of what is going on and the issue so far hasn't been addressed by management.

This week a few new hires started. I've been training them and can confirm they have the exact same duties as us ""old"" people - and I would argue they have far less responsibility, as we veterans have duties that they aren't qualified to do yet (including, but not limited to, the training itself). I even ventured to ask what their rate is, and they confirmed they are making the higher hourly wage.

So, what I'm wondering is, what should I do or say to broach this topic with my superiors? I could really use the extra money, but I know that's not their problem. I'm a non-employee contractor, as well - could they just fire me for asking? The company has otherwise been a delight to work with. Should I keep my mouth shut? Is there a polite, diplomatic way to assert my belief that I deserve the same pay as the newbies? Thank you.

"Hi redditors,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a recent graduate from my masters degree and for about the last 8 months or so  I have been working at my dream firm. This opportunity came suddenly and was a massive honor and immediately I jumped on it. This firm is to my profession what Vogue Magazine is to fashion- it's a big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I started, I have been on a huge learning curve, doing things that I have never done before, are very data and software heavy, etc. and along the way have been making lots of little mistakes. I get praised very very often by my project managers and the partners about my work and about my potential in the company, but I still feel like 50% of the work I give my advisors has some type of error in it- graphic discrepancies, mathematical errors, forgetting to include x y z, etc. And I cannot stop worrying and obsessing over the potential consequences of this. I cant stop fearing for my job or that they will let me go, and that has been extremely exacerbated by this most recent event:

&amp;#x200B;

We have an extremely high-profile project that I have given support on for a few days on when I first started, but only at arms length. The brunt of the work for the past 2.5 years on this project has been done by another intermediate staff. Our client has requested change after change to the product but this time around they wanted to take 2 weeks to redo the entire process and have it be final. The staff that would have normally done this, had to go on vacation during this time, and the firm elected me to take over the *entire* redesign (with programs I am mostly familiar with, minus some tips and tricks I learn as I go) along with all of the technical outputs and graphic components. This was an absolutely HUGE undertaking and I was working 13-15 hour days and weekends for two weeks to pull everything off alone.

&amp;#x200B;

There was one portion of the project that was a data-driven portion that I didn't feel confident was done with the utmost precision, but my project manager hadn't gone in and checked the source file and the outputs- more just trusted that everything is correct. At this stage (brand new a. to the job and b. to the project) I really feel like I needed someone with the experience to look this over in much more detail. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main staff came back from vacation, and our draft deliverable to the client is due in a couple of days. The potential of discrepancies on that one component has been EATING away at me for days, and I raised the issue today (I'm on holiday) to my project manager and the main staff. I said that I am unsure how consequential any discrepancies might be, but I need someone other than my own eyes to cross-check this.  I am deeply concerned that there may be huge errors warranting hours of changes to all of the other portions of the work, and I worry that for this they may fire me. I wanted to bring it up sooner but my PM seemed very confident that it was all good and I have been pushed back onto my other projects as they were piling up while covering for my colleague on this project.

&amp;#x200B;

My true intention, while I know I should have spoken up sooner, is to bring to light any potential errors before our final product goes to the client. I would rather take the fall internally than have our credibility dinged down the line. But in light of this, I do worry that if things really are amiss, I will be fired.

Hello Reddit,

The title of my post pretty much sums it up. I am a late 20's female in a metropolitan area with 5 years of experience managing custom design &amp; fabrication projects. Although I do not have a college degree, I have been able to utilize my competitiveness, along with grit and an intense fear of failure to work my way up to 65k annually. It may seem like a good salary for my age and experience level, but the cost of living in my city is very high so it really is just an okay middle of the road salary.

I am tired, Reddit. After filling my current role for a year, I am starting to seriously question whether I want to be a project manager anymore. The requirements of my current position are excessive, and there is an unhealthy culture of expectation in the company. I spend everyday fire fighting and trying to rush to project delivery, with little to no support from my peers. The company does not have a sales rep, account manager, purchasing department, or any project coordinators. Trying to fill all of these critical positions, along with the actual duties of a project manager, have left me exhausted. I am overwhelmed, and my performance is suffering. Management seems to value my contributions but refuses to recognize that you can not reasonably expect one person to fill so many roles. It is a toxic environment, and I am vigorously applying to new jobs as tension has been rising and I do not know that the current position will be sustainable much longer.

Okay, enough catharsis, let's get to the fun stuff. **How can I spin my current skill set to acquire a job that is less stressful and more fulfilling?** If at all possible, I would like to maintain my current income level which is really just enough to make ends meet in this expensive city.

I love customer service and ""the thrill of the hunt"", such as securing new and high value contracts. I love being outdoors, gardening, and animals.

"Progressed to partner interview at a big 4 firm with the last of the third interview being another case study when I was advised it was going to be a behavioural type. Nevertheless, I was prepared and as advised by the partner it was a good opportunity to see how I think. After the interview, the partner provided good feedback with one of the highlights being that I was a strategic thinker and that my career path was going to be bright. Today I got a call from their HR department..that although the interview went well, they have gone with a stronger candidate. When I requested for feedback, they advised that the other candidate was stronger in terms of experience and the surprise third case study.  This has obviously upsetted me, however I still have a job so I can't complain. I spoke to a friend who advised that I drop my ""not settling down for less"" attitude and that I should be aiming for junior roles because I am in my mid 20s.

"Hi guys! Got quite a pickle here that I was hoping to hear some 2 cents from you guys:

&amp;#x200B;

So, in the past few months I've gotten really sick of living in Japan and since I'm dating a New Yorker, I've decided to move to NYC within this year. 

Very luckily, I got a company interested in me and I'm very likely to receive an offer from them soon (probably by the end of the month). However, I'm not American so applying for a visa may take about 1-2 months. The new company is acknowledged of this, so they're wondering if I could start working (or working remotely) in July? (My desired start date is September) 

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is, right now I'm working for a really small company in Tokyo. We are 7 people right now and one of the staff is going to leave the company next month. I happen to be of a higher rank than that leaving staff, which makes my leaving even more critical, let alone a combination of two key players in the company leaving at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

What makes it worse is that we have two important company events in July; if I were to leave then, my boss will almost have no help with the events as in fact half the team is located in the Philippines. My boss seems to know that I'd like to leave soon though...

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, my family really wants me to go home in Hong Kong before moving to NYC, which I completely understand and would love to do so. But given this timeline, how can I make everything work? 

\---------

TL;DR: New company wants me to start working in NYC (or remotely) in July + current company going through a sticky situation and needs me in Tokyo until October + family wants me to spend a month at home in Hong Kong before I move to NYC. 

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT SHOULD I DO? 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about working part-time first for both companies in order to smooth things out during the transition period? New company seems to be okay with me working remotely first or to fly me to NYC for a training first then work remotely for a couple months.

It’s said unsolicited advice only serves the giver. I don’t have a personal agenda. A few reflections which might be helpful to early-in-career professionals

**perquisite**

**·** ***n.***

**A payment, profit, or benefit received in addition to a regular wage or salary, especially when due or expected.**

Looking back on thirty plus years of a career, the view is like peering through a kaleidoscope of once colorful experiences, that through the lens of reflection are shrinking and fading when viewed with the light of today.

My work has always involved travel. Travel to client sites, offices around the country and even the world. That might sound alluring, but the reality- of long days and delays on planes, trains and automobiles, late evening arrivals into some worn out hotels which appear more tired than the travelers they shelter and airplane and airport food one only eats because there’s nothing else to be had – it’s a mashup of Willy Loman’s life in Death of A Salesman and Phil the Weatherman’s in GroundHog Day! Now and again, one travels for work and discovers some beautiful new places and people we might not have encountered if not for that business trip. However, usually, it’s a quick parachute in, get the work done, then on to the next project, place and people. In the middle 90’s and earlier, companies began shedding their on-staff resources, lowering their overhead and bringing in armies of contractors/consultants, like me. And we contractors were paid for travel time. That’s right. When there is no full time guarantee of hours, job security, health care, nor retirement funds, at least there *was* paid travel time. Mostly a small fee, or depending on how many time zones were crossed, maybe a larger one. Sometimes a day’s wage if one were traveling across oceans (a single day’s wage for travel which spanned two or more days, going and returning). Then, the tech bust happened and the early aughts stripped all paid travel time to zero. Want the work? Getting there and back is your “investment”, no matter how many hours or days getting there and back, no matter the fatigue of working then jumping on any red-eye flight available, no matter the jet lag days to readjust your clock after an overseas gig. It’s all on you.

Business class travel is also a shadowy memory for most of us road warriors. Again, pre-2000, clients looked at this as a necessity, if they wanted a lucid consultant to show up in their worldwide offices that required a 12-14-16 hour flight, not mentioning airport time in connections. At under five feet tall and sub 90 pounds, I can easily fit into a coach seat, but the added comforts of a business class trip are what once allowed me to withstand a 29 hour airport delay (airplane mechanical issue needed fixing), a 4a.m. landing/ 5a.m. hotel arrival and still make the 8:30 meeting with my wits and sanity intact. And it was in a time zone exactly ten hours off my home zone.  No excuses, no whining, and a full day’s work done after the trip from hell. Try doing that after the same trip in coach – sardine’d in with 150 other passengers with no quiet, no privacy and no room because your rowmates, no fault of theirs, can’t ***possibly*** fit in a 17 inch wide seat, so they are sharing yours.

Granted the paid travel and business class flights were comforts. Comforts which assuaged the “all work, no life” tradeoff that many of us chose. Ever wondered why everybody else on those planes, all the “nerd birds” flying around in the early 2000’s were so very single?  Who could manage to have a life? And if we chose the “work hard, play hard” ethos, we also chose the elevated “per diem” fees in lieu of steady, predictable salaries. Or thought we did. We chose that trade off for “independence” and “freedom” as contractors. To have more free time, or if not more of it, to choose ***when*** to have free time and when to work. When I started as an independent contractor in the latter 90’s, the firm with which I contracted made no secret of its deliberate strategy of paying 20-30% ***above*** the industry average. Best way to get the best people, its founder and leaders said. The sure way to attract and retain the needed resources to handle the ebb and flow of client demand, they said too. But that also changed. Most contractors I know have seen stagnant per diem fees, year over year decline, despite taking on more and more days, taking all work they can find. Consequently, few ever take any “time off” unless by necessity – it’s not that they leave open days on their calendars to vacation, explore other pursuits or just relax and recharge their batteries; they mostly take the maximum number of days they can find, working with multiple firms which use contractors, just to cobble together a livable income. Open time on their calendars is the result of time that couldn’t be booked to any client company. I now work for three different firms, juggling projects between them. I have to. Upon doing my recent tax return, I realized my income from that first firm I joined back in 1998 earned me LESS in 2018 than in my first full year as a contractor *in actual dollars*. While the per diem fee has risen, it’s not commensurate with cost of living inflation and the actual number of days I now get is approximately 25% of the volume of work in the late 90’s. no wonder I and all the contractors/consultants I consider colleagues work for multiple firms, “gigging” our way through from project to project. We have to.

Reflecting back, the paid travel stipends (gone), business class travel accommodations (gone) and once generous pay scale (long gone) are a very dim sight in the rear view mirror. it’s a race to the bottom documented over decades of work. What’s my take on all this? For younger professionals, I advocate a few things: first, know that your work is just that. It’s a job. It can be a good job, it can afford you the life you want, you can meet some interesting people and even make some lifelong friends, but don’t fool yourself into thinking your job will “change the world” or every day you “make a difference”. That’s just the message which gets you to accept lower pay for your time and keeps you running on the endlessly turning hamster wheel to nowhere. And time is all we, any of us, have. Think about how you want to spend that time, your *real* capital. Advocate for yourselves to negotiate the highest pay you can get at every stage of your career. This might sound cynical but you cannot eat altruism.  Second, always stay open to acquiring new skills and experiences. Contractor or not, “job security” is illusory. Just ask anyone who worked at Digital Equipment Corp., Yahoo, or My Space. Your only security is your marketable skill set. That trashes the “do what you love”, “live your passion” storyline, but having a practical eye, earning more than what your basic needs require can finance activities that make you fulfilled, too. Third, build your life. Collect happy memories like you’d collect “likes” on social media (so-so media?). Enriching your memory bank is the true wealth of human experiences and you can deposit friendships, laughter and love in that memory bank daily. 

And on that Hallmark note, I’ll leave it to you. Make your next thirty years count.",Adjusting to a New Normal,1

"Hello Everyone,

I finished and obtained my master degree from an aeronautics univ with the speciality in Embedded System in October and since then I really don't know what to do, and I need some advice.

Right now, I don't feel any more interest in Aeronautics or space, I have actually done my final internship (like a master thesis) in a semiconductor company abroad so I can assume that I am more on the Embedded Sytem field in general.

The first problem that I encountered is that I am more on the Software side of the field, but I realized either by myself or during interviews that I miss quite a lot of important notions (I messed few times online programming tests during interviews) and I don't have projects (except this internship to talk about). I tried to follow some online classes (like CS50) but I feels so stressed and not so interested in the end that I gave up.

Since January, I am currently working in a consulting company in my country, I am in a mission (until July) where I mostly do documentation/software/engineering that that I really don't like and I am totally getting depressed about it.

As I said I messed up quite a lot of interviews, that were truly good opportunities, that right now I don't know if I should purse this path.

Should I try to persevere getting employed in that field ?

Should I try others online classes or simply do an other master at a university abroad ?

Or should I simply get out of this field and try to find an other path (I have no idea what to do else, except travelling and getting fresh air) ?

Do you have any suggestions ?",Graduate and feeling stuck in the path to purse. Any advice ?,1

"Just curious what others might advise as a good career path.

I'm a 31 year old female, soon to be 32, with two kids about to be in school full time.  I have a Bachelor's Degree with a double major in Psychology and Sociology, with 3 incomplete minors in Religion Studies, Studio Art, and German.  Don't ask me about German because I remember nothing as I've never used the language since college.

I've been a store manager at Game Stop; worked 10 years at a well known drive-in in my area and went from cook, to server, to manager; worked registration at an animal hospital; worked at a blood bank call center; and for the past 4 years have worked at a major hospital in registration.

I don't have any goals in terms of a career, just mainly a dollar amount I would like to hit.  I'm not looking to be wealthy, just comfortable, so something between $50-75,000/year would be just fine.  I'm willing to go back to school if necessary.

"Cisco is at the Apex of the IT sector which would be providing various certifications to the candidates and CCIE Security certification is considered to be the most popular of amongst them. Talking about [***CCIE Security certification***](https://cciedump.spoto.net/ccie-security-lab.php?id=wm) precisely, the exam would be conducted for the candidates who possess the necessary skills in order to execute and support immersive network security solutions. For acquiring this, the individuals seek the help of the latest and best industry practices. The final motive of the individuals is just to make sure that the environments and the network systems are going to be protected against various modern threats, and security risks.

| Chief Information Officer (CIO) | $240,000 |
| Computer and Information Scientist, Research | $275,000 |

**1. The scope of CCIE Security**

It is considered to be the most famous when we compared it with other Cisco &amp; IT certifications. People think; a lot before the registration for the CCIE Security exam though it offers immense scope to them. This is because the complexity level of the exam is quite high. The IT industry at present requires around 5,00,000 CCIE’s across the globe. To which currently, we only have about 58,000 CCIE Security Certification, Holder. Now, with this given figure we all can come to the conclusion that what would be the level of the salary packages which would be offered to the aspiring candidates after acquiring this certification. Being CCIE certified is not only going to be good in terms of money, but also as a matter of respect in the industry.

**2. CCIE Security Salary Packages:**

Excellent salary packages would be offered to the candidates from the very beginning of their acquisition of this certification. For a normal graduate, things could be are really hard. They wouldn’t be paid as much as the qualifications that they would be possessing easily. But as and when one has the title of CCIE Security certified, things change for him immediately. Enormous salary packages are offered to them across the globe.

**3. Easy and Rapid Promotion:**

As and when we compare the CCNA and CCNP candidates, you are likely going to get the promotion faster, if you have acquired the CCIE Security certification. This is because it is assumed by the IT companies that the CCIE certified candidates have the knowledge about networking in-depth. So, they would be wishing that their project leaders be from among the CCIE Security certified.

**4. Unbound Career Opportunities:**

After the acquisition of the CCIE Security Exam, Career opportunities wouldn’t be found only within the boundaries of the nation but it has quite a vast scope outside the country too. If you desire of working internationally for a longer period, then sure the CCIE Security certification is like a lottery ticket for you. Already, more than 10% of the exam clearers are working abroad at present in the countries which include the UAE, USA, and QATAR.

**5. Training Imparted in the field:**

If we go back in the past a few years, there were not enough the CCIE Security certified trainers and setting up of the CCIE security labs which would demand a huge investment. But when we look at them now, things have changed a lot. Now, there are lots of institutions, like the SPOTO which have a team of qualified professionals who providing CCIE Security training to the candidates. Also, they have the latest training infrastructure for the freshers undoubtedly. The training is going to be imparted to the students from the very beginning which means that they are made to learn first the basics and fundamentals of the certification.

"I'm an engineer with a kinda weird assortment of experience. I have a physics degree, and I've dipped my toes into many professional waters - from biology research (in college) to designing solar energy systems (my first job after college) to making space suits (in an internship). I was laid off about a month ago, and fortunately was hired to a new job pretty quickly, which is at an electrical engineering consulting firm. It's my first week, so I haven't really established myself or grown a loyalty to my new company, though I think I'll like my coworkers a lot as I get to know them, and I'llbe able to get good at it. But the work itself isn't necessarily my forte, or my main interest. I'd rather be working on engineering a single type of product that I believe in (like when I was doing solar), or doing R&amp;D rather than consulting. I still find my job interesting and can learn a lot from it though, and it pays pretty well.

So I'm pretty happy with my new job, and have been unsubscribing from all job alerts and telling recruiters ""sorry, got a job and I like it and want to keep it."" But I get a call yesterday from a recruiter who works with NASA, looking for someone to engineer space suits. Just like the internship I had (not at NASA, though) that I loved and had figured was just a once-in-a-lifetime thing. 

But holy crap that call stoked the daydream fire. Should I pursue it? Is chasing Mars worth leaving the city I love and want to live in the rest of my life if I get the job?

"Hi there - looking for feedback on my resignation plan before I execute.

Long story short I have a prebooked family vacation for a week that is immovable. For me that “pays out” more than if i leave and cash in vacation days (50% payout). 

From a timeline perspective when I plan to resign - this vaca week would be week 3 thru 4 from that resignation moment. 

My plan was to give 4 weeks resignation notice (with that last week being the vacation already booked and telling them that and offering to be avail as needed that week for hand off) versus giving 2 or 3 weeks notice and taking the vacation without the company days. I leave money on the table with a gap when the new role starts then and after what I put in I feel it’s deserved. 

Is this commonly acceptable? Would you recco a different move?

Related question - if after I give 4 weeks notice - they decide to show me out immediately (which is common - I do not see them keeping me here much longer than a week after notice) - typically do companies pay out for the notice period the person gave or knowing that is the culture would you change your recco ?",Resigning - last week is already planned vacation - what to do?,1

Now this company has provided a reference to my new employer saying I was dismissed. I have provided the context as to how this dismissal happened after being asked by the new employer.

"As the title reads, I unfortunately lost my cool and quit my job on the spot after being with them for a year and a half. I've never done this before and consider myself a good reliable, employee but for some reason I found myself walking out of this service job. 

To provide some context I graduated 2 years ago from a decent school with a degree in Marketing and was unhappy with the job prospects out of school. Without finding anything permanent, I ended up working a service job in the beverage industry and began to enjoy it over time. It was a cool, hip spot and I felt like I fit in with the culture. I ended up making my way into the manager role which was a welcome promotion but still left me deeply unsatisfied. I appreciated the experience and the responsibility it taught me but it still did not feel right and left me yearning for more. I also live in an area that is extremely slow in the off-season and has a huge rush in the summer months, so the winter months left me with little to do. Also the work environment became horrible over time. I realized my co-workers were extremely bad people and it began to effect me over time, mainly my mental health. I was treated so, so poorly by coworkers on countless occasions. I'd rather not get into specifics but I needed to get out of this small town bubble. 

Because of my dissatisfaction, I decided to look for housing and work closer to my circle of friends where we attended our undergrad. I fell in love with that area and wanted desperately to go back.  So I let my work know months advance that I had begun looking for housing and work and gave them a rough timeline of how things would play out. It's a tiny business and we are all pretty friendly for the most part so I thought this was just a normal conversation. Turns out they demoted me of my position and cut my hours drastically after hearing word of my notice. This meant loss of the few benefits I had and much, much lower pay after being there for a year. My time was cut in half. Not to mention the work environment had become worse than ever. I am currently down 10 pounds my normal weight and it's taken a noticeable toll. In hindsight, I should have never given my notice to the company but I thought it was the genuine right thing to do so they would be in the best shape come the busy summer months. 

So the other day I decided that my life is too short to be miss-treated like this so I walked out. I explained to my boss the situation and they are not happy whatsoever. Luckily, I have plenty of savings by living at home, have had many job interviews (sales/marketing) in the area and will be moving in mid-July. 

But for now I am 23, unemployed, and have a feeling of guilt that I can't shake. I feel worse than before. I'm disappointed that after all that time I burned a bridge and acted poorly.

"I am competing with my colleague for a promotion. I work in the banking industry. We recently got a new boss as my old boss left for greener pastures. I have always been the quiet type that gets the job done and people who have worked with me know of my work ethics and the superior work that i produce.

&amp;#x200B;

My colleague has been working in the same company for 10 years. He has never delivered above the absolute minimal. But recently with a possible promotion, he has been schmoozing my new boss and has been producing more results that is directly visible to my boss. My new boss seems to have taken the bait. I'm a great technical worker and I always help out my teammates. My performance reviews for the past 2 years were rated at the highest possible grade and if not for the new boss, i was in line for a promotion.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to go about this. Do i mention that my colleague never did any real work in the past and this new found identify of his is a hoax? The work that he is doing is prompt but mistake laden as he just wants to be the first to respond to issues. The new manager cannot tell the difference. I know most will say to take the high road and just be yourself and so forth. But i want to know how to secure my promotion and not lose to a kiss ass. At the current rate, i feel like my colleague will take it because he knows how to play the game. I am more of an introvert and do not wish to play these corporate games. I'm a practical person and if someone is more deserving of something, i will be happy for them. But in this case, losing out on the promotion has nothing to do with my performance and technical abilities. what should i do?",Competing with kick ass colleague for promotion,1

"My (28f) husband (34m) has been in his current position (CSR) for 3 years. After bonuses he makes about 47k. 

He's applied for several internal positions, makes it to the final round, and then someone with more experience takes the position. He seems to have plateaued. He has an associates in business administration. The company is incredible and treats their employees well. 

A position in his current department has become available, and it is basically his if he wants it. This is a manager level position (huge for his resume), and comes with a 20-25k salary increase. He'd make about 70k after bonuses.

The hours are pretty terrible. Sunday 5pm-2am, and M-Th nights 8pm-5am. 

We are trying to weigh the pros and cons of this. Obviously 25k is nothing to scoff at, and the title will benefit him in his future career. But we'd see each other very little. He would have to sign on for a year minimum, but this IS 'temporary'. We don't have children yet, and I'm in graduate school for one more year, so we could write this off as just a crazy year.

"The majority of my friends plan on going to college to pursue engineering, health field, etc.; no question about it, we want to work on a level that requires additional degrees and qualifications. One of my friends, however, seems to lack a motivation to do anything in his future in terms of a career. He is extremely intelligent, STEM-oriented, and technologically savvy. He has expressed interest in developing a video game/creating game-related products, but doesn't seem to be interested in anything after high school. You can be successful without going to college, but he has shown no interest in ANY kind of job or career at all. I'm worried that he will fall flat after high school, settle on a sub-par job/life, and never pursue his interests and dreams.

"Hello,
  I'm currently a senior in college and have completed in internship, where i am now hired part time temporarily. I found this arangement to be really great, because as a full time student i am extremely overwhelmed. I struggle a bit academically. I know myself, and I know how much i can handle before i start to get so overwhelmed and fail. It's happened before and i'm worried about it happening again as i'm starting to lose the balance i've been maintaing, between graduation coming up, finals, many essays, assignments, and more responsibility from this part time position piling up. 

Today my boss sent me an email that shared a conversation between her and a contact of hers who may have a job opportuinity for me (she wants to help me get a full time job after my temporary position is over). The owner of the company she contacted agreed to talk to me on the phone, which sounds nice and is a good opportunity. However, this company is about an hour away from me, their work hours are about 11 hours daily and it requires super early mornings, late nights, and 2 hours of driving. Maybe some people can handle this or wouldnt mind it, but i dont think i can. I dont want to anger my boss by turning down this opportunity, but i was only given one days notice before i have to call him. I feel like im unprepared, worried, nervous, and overwhelmed. I also would love to keep my part time position until is is over in 2 months. So, with all of that said, my requests for advice pertain to these areas:
- does the hours, distance, etc seem like something overwhelming? (I struggle with low energy and i'm very shy and have alot of anxiety, im also overwhelmed with school and work right now so i'm just feeling lost and scared) 

- lets say they offer me a job, or an interveiw where they offer me a job, is it acceptable to request to complete my temporary position (it ends in 2 months) before starting with a new job? (I feel like i am learning alot at this temp job and what i learn in the next 2 months will benefit me)

"Hi,

I've been working an entry level engineering job for 6 months now, having graduated in September of 2018. It pays pretty good, and I can work well. I'm 23, turning 24 this August. I want to ask for some career/life advice. 

I'm at a dilemma. So I graduate, start working, could possibly progress up within the company. Then what? Perhaps it's my lack of maturity, or I'm overthinking. I can't really say that I'm happy. Of course, the paycheck can relief some pressure, but I still worry about my future.

So I took this job and within a month, I was given leadership responsibilities and was left to steer the department solo over Christmas. I did overtime hours and was remunerated for my efforts.

I am about to finish my second year in college, my grades aren't great but I'm assuming I can finish my degree in four years. I am studying history, which is a degree field without many promising career outcomes. I have been toying with the idea of learning a skilled trade (plumbing, masonry, etc.) after college because it seems like many blue collar industries are not at risk of being outsourced or automated. Most seem to pay reasonably well, and I believe that I would probably get some satisfaction out of a career where I work with my hands. My concern is that for things like plumbing or masonry, you need to enter an apprenticeship program that doesn't pay as well as you would within your actual career field.

"Hi all!

Here's a list of 5 Salary Negotiation Tips, so you can avoid making the biggest Salary Negotiation Mistakes.  By following these tips, you'll be more successful in negotiating a higher salary.  You can watch the video here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAi4gytXBOg&amp;t=87s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAi4gytXBOg&amp;t=87s)

&amp;#x200B;

I've also put a transcript of the video below.  Hope this helps some of you! :)

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 1: Be Honest 

 I'm shocked by the number of people who lie about their accomplishments in order to impress the boss during salary negotiations, AND  it’s such a  HUGE mistake to make.  Some people say they earn double the money than they actually did.  Others say they worked at a prestigious company they’ve never even stepped foot in or completed projects that never even existed... Let’s just make this clear.  When you lie, you run the risk of the company researching and discovering that you are in fact lying. And nobody  wants to work with a liar. You can kiss your job and salary negotiations goodbye. So, instead let’s choose to be honest and talk about the real value you can bring to the company. Employers respect honesty and will commend you for it.  

&amp;#x200B;

 Tip 2: Share Accomplishments  

Don’t make the mistake of withholding your accomplishments during your salary negotiation.  Talking about yourself and your accomplishments may feel as if you’re bragging, but it’s so important for the company to understand your successful background. Companies are willing to offer a higher salary to someone who would bring in the most value. They will only understand your value, if you tell them about your accomplishments! You can use them as examples when answering a question or you can use them to justify your request for a higher salary. The more key accomplishments you share, the more the boss will understand how talented you are, which could increase the salary that may be offered to you.   

&amp;#x200B;

 Tip 3: Research Salary 

 There will come a time during the negotiation where you will be offered a salary or asked what your salary expectations are.Taking the time to research what you should be earning in the role will allow you to confidently negotiate for a fair salary and avoid accepting an offer that is well below what you deserve. Remember, the more time you spend preparing the more confident you will be when negotiating your salary.     

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 4: Stay Positive   

The idea of negotiating your salary can be very emotional, but it’s important to stay positive.    You’ll find that your positivity will be well received, and the negotiations will go smoothly because acting negative is not very professional and can actually lead to emotionally fuelled arguments.  As an example, if the boss began yelling at you during the negotiation , you’d be thinking …”There is no way I’m working for anyone this angry”  Right? The same goes for your boss.  If you were acting negative, it’s less likely they’d want to negotiate because they could think you have a bad attitude.   So remember, stay positive and enthusiastic for a better outcome.   

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 5: Be prepared  

One of the biggest mistakes you can make when negotiating your salary is doing zero preparation beforehand, meaning you are leaving things to chance and hoping you can come up with answers on the spot. This could make you panic if a question is asked that you’re not ready for.   Salary Negotiation is something you can in fact prepare for! You can do this by researching and answering several important questions that will come up in advance, so that you have all the key information ready. My free salary negotiation checklist outlines everything you need  to help you prepare for salary negotiation; you can download this by following the link in the description box below. By taking the time to prepare, you'll feel much more confident when it’s time to negotiate your salary.",5 Salary Negotiation Tips in 2019 (Avoid the MOST Common Mistakes),1

There's no other position here for me so I know I need to look elsewhere but I don't know where to start. I have a lot of hobbies but none that I can think of making a career out of. I don't even know what industries/companies I'd be interested in.

"So for a while now I've been trying to decide what the best course of action is right now but I haven't been able to decide.

As much as I would like to go back to school after this gap year and start my career path, I don't know exactly what I want to do in life. I'm not the wealthiest of folk around, and I'm pretty sure I don't meet the exact requirements for receiving a lot of financial aid or scholarships, so I don't want to jump into anything that will make me spend money that's not needed.

Now that I’m thinking about all the “ifs” and timing, I’m wondering about whether there’s a certain etiquette with job offers.

&amp;nbsp;

For a little more clarity, I’ll describe the four jobs I’m being interviewed for as jobs #1-4, ranked by my preference (#1 being my top choice). So I’ve already interviewed for jobs #1, 2, and 4. Job #1 already got back to me to schedule a second/final interview (yay!), but it’s not until May 8. Jobs #2 and #4 are probably making their hiring decisions this week or next. My interview for job #3 is on Monday, and there would definitely be another interview after that if they wanted to move forward (Monday’s is on the phone).

&amp;nbsp;

Here are some of my questions:

&amp;nbsp;

If I receive offers from jobs #2 and/or #4 this week, assuming I’m able to negotiate salaries to what I want, what’s the longest reasonable amount of time to wait before I get back to them to accept one? A couple days? I would primarily be trying to buy time to see how things go with job #1. 

&amp;nbsp;

Say it’s the best case scenario (for now) and I end up with an offer I like, this week or next, for job #2. Is it shitty to accept an offer knowing that I might rescind my acceptance before I start, if I end up with an offer for job #1? I have a guilty conscience and would be afraid to burn bridges or burden the company with having to search again.

&amp;nbsp;

If the answer to the above question is no, how far out could I reasonably schedule my start date, to allow room for job #1 to pan out first? I’m not currently working and they know that, so I can’t say anything like my current employer needs me to stay, etc. To be more specific: if I accept an offer from job #2 this week, does starting on May 20 (or later?!) seem reasonable? That would allow a week and a half after my final interview for job #1 (on May 8) for them to make an offer.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks in advance for any advice! I know this is all pretty specific but I’m trying to make some decisions in advance so I don’t get caught off guard with a phone call or something.",Job Offer Etiquette,1

"I recently graduated am experiencing that old lament over not doing something more useful. I am looking for advice about my path forward.

I double majored in maths and physics for most of my undergraduate. When I was closer to graduation in maths I just took the degree and ran with a heavy physics minor. At one time I thought I was a theoretician or scientist. Really I'm more of an artist who happens to love mathematics. Someone should have been screaming at me to go into engineering all along considering some of my favorite courses were statics/ dynamics, and classical mechanics, and my favorite projects involved writing physics simulations.

From what I've read, it seems that a bachelors in engineering plus an internship is enough to land a good job. I am not super confident in my ability to get funding for grad school. I could save even more getting a bachelors by going to a smaller school, which is my preference anyway.

Would a master's be overkill? I am not super career oriented. I just want something intellectually stimulating to comfortably get by so I can focus on better things. Plus, without an engineering background I'd likely have to take many undergraduate prereqs anyway.


tl;dr: Which is the better investment for someone who already has a BS in maths, a masters in engineering or a second bachelors?

"A few months ago, I made a career transition from academia to a job in the business world. I had long wanted to make a career transition but wasn't sure of the direction I should take since I'd always been on a pretty narrow and niche track. I jumped at the first thing that shook out, and it's become VERY clear to me that I made the wrong choice -- both as a result of things I've learned since I joined the company and finding I shouldn't have ignored things that came up in the interview process that I wrote off. I ignored a lot of things I shouldn't have because I was starting to feel desperate that I'd never make the transition and this was my only option. I won't make that mistake again...

Luckily, I have a friend in my old field who's offered me a contract gig that will cover me for 6ish months while I work to find something new, so I'll have some time to do a more detailed search for the next thing with open eyes and a better sense of my priorities. However, that won't start for 1-2 months and I can't leave where I am currently, but I'd like to start applying for things and having networking conversations. I don't want to put my current role on my resume, and eventually I think the contract job will just let me paper over things.

The problem? The first thing that comes up when you Google my name is my headshot and bio for the current job. If anyone hiring Googles me -- which is more likely than not to happen -- the first thing they're going to see is that I'm not being ""truthful"" with them (even though I know a resume is a marketing document and not a list of every job you've ever had). If they even want to call me for an interview after seeing that, I am scared that I will be written off for not addressing it.

"TL;DR Boss forgot they had approved my time off, keeps texting me for non urgent matters all during my week off. Ready to blow a gasket.

I work for a small company owned by a couple a few years older than myself. It's mostly menial labor stuff, going to clients' businesses, homes, etc. I'm the only full-time employee they have, and everything is done really informally. I get paid in cash because they still don't have payroll set up.

I should NOT be stressed out by this job at all. However, I am completely burnt out, frustrated, and resentful because they are so disorganized in their managing of things and disrespectful of my personal time. I scheduled this entire week off to myself to deal with some personal things, and I have been texted by my boss three out of my five weekdays off. NONE of it was in any way urgent; this is the type of job you leave when you go home and there's really no need to text me unless there's a scheduling change. They literally forgot that I had requested off and they had approved it a month ago, so on Tuesday they asked why I hadn't clocked in the day before. We missed two appointments with clients because of it and now I have to go next week when I wasn't supposed to in the first place.

This is my week off to destress, and I am beyond stressed right now. I have had tightness in my chest, knots in my stomach all week, and I haven't had that level of anxiety in a long time. All I wanted this week was to be left the f**k alone to rest and get a few things done for myself that I've been neglecting.

I don't know how to point out to them politely that they need to respect my time off and not text me about work when I'm not AT work. They act like we're all buddies and whatever, which is fine to have a chat and get along at work, but they are in no way involved in my life outside of that and I want to keep it that way. I think it's just unprofessional and unhealthy, and for my sanity I need those boundaries.

I'm also frustrated at the disorganization. They have praised me for my organizational skills and even admit that I'm way better at it than they are, and when they changed me to full time instead of part time they made it sound like i would have opportunity to advance and do more organizing and administrative stuff that I'm really good at. This job by itself is a complete waste of a bachelor's degree, but it's been about six months since I started full time (1 year total working here) and no talk of advancement whatsoever.

Yes. I'm doing the obvious and looking for another job, but in the mean time I need to establish healthy boundaries.

 It's a very small town, and they always know when I'm home or not because of it, but that shouldn't matter if I'm off work. Just because I'm home doesn't mean I'm free for them to communicate with me. One time my boss asked if I was available for a special one-time client appointment and I said I would have to check my planner since I didn't have it with me and their response was, ""I don't think I have you scheduled for anything that day."" That's exactly my point though. The alternate days where I don't have clients and I know that in advance, I need to fill those time slots with other personal things. Another time they asked me the night before if I could come with them to a client's to help. I said no because I already had plans and they acted like they were doing me a favor offering the extra hours by springing it on my the night before even though they would have had the client scheduled at least a week before.",How to set healthy workplace boundaries...?,1

Hello!

I completed 5 semesters (2.5 years) at a state university in the Computer Science program. This last semester was really hard for me for personal and financial reasons. My family ended up moving to a different state over a thousand miles away, and a lot of my friends had ended up either graduating or transferring away to different schools. The combination of those factors in addition to a rough semester academically (studio classes and constant bombardment of hyper low level assignments) ultimately led me to decide to take a break from school for a while and just look for a job to bulk up my bank account and hopefully regain some perspective for why I was doing what I was doing. I have been offered a software-engineering internship for the summer and plan on taking it (assuming the company doesn't have a problem with the academic hiatus). Afterwards though I was thinking of either finding just a job to pass the time and save for tuition until 2020 when I would be eligible for in-state tuition in my new state. Ideally I would like to keep looking for tech/development related experience. My GPA was about a 3.85/4.00 so I am hoping I wouldn't have a super hard time transferring to the local college in my new city when the time arises. I have a few questions for reddit though.

I work for a large utilities company, and have the opportunity to pre-apply for a new role as a SFS, after 'shoulder taps' from a senior SFS and a SAP consultant, independantly stating they will recommend me if I choose to apply. (Job is not yet advertised)

I have no SQL or ABAP knowledge, but I am very familiar with the cause/effect/reasoning of a lot of processes between different departments.

As for my current situation, I recently changed my role from an Operations Coordinator to a Analytical/Recincilliation role in Dec-18. This is a reasonably well paid job, with medium stress and a great team, I enjoy this role, and find everything interesting, and I feel im being groomed for management.

I'd like to hear thoughts on whether I go for the SFS role, or stick with my current role. I'm strongly leaning towards SFS, but I feel like I may have tunnel vision. I'd appreciate getting other perspectives.

Some points to discuss are:

1- I've heard of the SFS role being a ''work hard, play hard"" kind of role, which means high stress and hours, but includes time off and roughly 20% more pay to start.
2- Is there anything I should know going into an SFS role?
3 - Analytics/Reconciliation has the potential to put me into level 3/high management within 10 years. SFS role has the potential to become a consultant within 5 years.
4 - Have you ever been at a crossroads in your career?

"By the time I landed my first interview for a remote job, I already felt like an expert in Skype interviews. I'd done several throughout and after college, and I had my process down pat: go to my bedroom, find a white wall, prop my computer up so my interviewer wouldn't get any weird views of my nostrils, plug in my headphones, check my makeup and lighting in a test video call, and wait patiently for my interviewer.

"Hey guys, 

I'll try to make this as short as possible, but it'll still be long. I am a criminal lawyer, and I want to work as a prosecutor. For many reasons,  being a defense attorney is not an option for me. 
Working for the Crown is very hard: it is a closed group, and they do not hire a lot. I did my internship there, and even tho they told me they loved my job, they couldn't keep me. They talked about me to other offices, and the municipal prosecutor will hire me somewhere between now and Sept. 2020. So I still have to look for a job, since it might take a year and a half.

Before telling you more about the job situation, there are a few things about me that have to be mentionned. First of all, I haven't been working for 4 months now, I am kind of going crazy, but money is not a problem at all. 
I adopted my dog after my internship and it turns out she has severe anxiety problem. I haven't been looking very hard for a job because my dog can't be left alone and I have to work very hard with her. If I leave the house, I have to bring her to a pet daycare. Not keeping my dog is NOT an option.  
Also, I have been in a relationship for 3 years, and my boyfriend, for many reasons (some of them are very good) wants to stay around where we are. 
I am also about to finish my master degree, this summer. Which might help me with the going crazy doing nothing part.

So, about the job. I had this interview, about 3h from where I live. They offered me a job as a replacement for an unknown duration. I could work there for one month or a year, no one knows. I would start 2 weeks from now. Yesterday, I called to accept the offer, but the person told me they'd call me back during the day and never did. So I still have some time to back up.

My problem is: if I move, my boyfriend leaves me. I will not explain the reasons since it's pretty complicated, but keep in mind they're good reasons (for his mental health among others). So I would have to move, alone, in a new apartment, with my dog, in under 10 days. I would have to find a new daycare for my dog, leave every friend and family behind, boyfriend included. All of this for maybe one or two months only, while finishing a master's degree, and trying to not make my dog anxious. But as I said, it could be a problem for my career, to refuse this opportunity. I would also make things worse with my dog's anxiety problems. 

Since I have been crying for many hours now, I am really wondering if I am making the right choice by accepting the offer.

TL;DR I am not sure if I want to be the kind of woman who lets her career control everything in her life.",I have to choose between my career and my personal life,1

My job has been frustrating because of the bad management and limited growth opportunity. I'm so unhappy at work everyday. 

I started my current job almost a year and half ago. This is my very first real job. It was a great opportunity after college and the pay was good for somebody like me that has a math degree.

Lately, I have been thinking about changing my job but I don't know where to go. I tried applying to other jobs but almost everything related to IT is too senior to me. I have never once actually figured our what I want to do in life either. I hate this feeling, I'm afraid I will never figure it out. 

I talked to some friends and did some research online. For my background I thought I could work towards becoming a full stack developer? I had taken several java classes in college, so I thought I could try to study more on my own and build a portfolio. But practically speaking, can I really self study and get myself a job in the field ?
I'm also wondering where people go after being an app support? Is there a job in between as a bridge to full stack engineer?

"I had an interview last night via video conference for a good job in a fantastic part of the world and one of the used the word ""shit"". Although they were simply describing a scenario, rather than directing it at me, I felt a strong twinge in my gut, an anxiety spike.

I've been out of  my career since June 2017 because of the combination of a major bereavement and workplace bullying.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I often swear myself in other circles (i.e. away from work), however seeing as the interview is generally meant to be 'people on their best behaviour', I've often found swearing/cursing during an interview has proven to a be big red-flag and a portent of what lies beyond... especially when in a professional career environment.

In fact, I've turned down job offers when this has happened, apart from the last career role, where during the interview MD said ""fuck"" while my soon-to-be line manager described the person I was replacing as a ""pain in the arse"". That proved to be possibly the biggest toxic shit-show I've ever encountered and when they realised I wasn't going to 'fit in' (become subjugate), they fired me without warning, by email, when I was off sick with stress - caused by them.

Naturally, I am now super wary of ever putting myself in that position again.

2. Worked for the government (Philippines) from 2015 til 2018 (**all NON IT Related jobs.** 2015-2016 was somewhat financial focused while 2018 was Internal Auditing but non financial. More on processes based on the office/division's manuals)
3. Resigned last October 2018 (**as an Internal Auditor**)
4. Was looking into programming / web developing, so I attended some trainings (HTML and CSS with Bootstrap training and PHP and MySQL training).
5. Tried to apply for some jobs in web development / programming(software engineer), no luck.
6. Recently had a job offer and a possible new job as a **""Junior Systems Analyst""** (Brief Responsibility: Implements computer system requirements by defining and analyzing system problems; designs and testing standards and solution.)
7. I'm 29 years of age. Going 30 this December.

I'm currently lost in terms of career and currently worried that if this continues, I might grow old without having any solid foundation of anything for my future (possibility of having my own family, decent salary, etc etc).

Getting to my main question, Junior Systems Analyst is somewhat of an uncharted territory to me. I would just like to know if the said profession:

1. has a bright future ahead of it or stick with applying as a programmer / software engineer
2. should I worry about my age and the job that I'll be accepting if ever (since its somewhat of an entry level here in Philippines)
3. Any room for career growth as a Systems Analyst.
4. Possible branches of discipline to ""promote"" myself careerwise in the future

I know that it's somewhat confusing as to what I want to point out in my post. I'm confused as well since I'm actually panicking with the state of my life right now. I apologize if you find this post somewhat of a ""self-pity"". I just need some opinions and thoughts from other people that has been , one way or another, in my situation.

"I’ve been in a position, my first job out of college, for a year and 3 months. It’s pretty rough, and after pursuing all normal means of remedy I can think of, the situation hasn’t improved and doesn’t look like it will any time soon.

Financially, I can afford to quit and take some time to regroup and job hunt. My concern is that quitting my first job out of school after only just over a year will burn me when I apply elsewhere.  I have no idea what to say to an interviewer if that comes up. I can’t just say that it was an unhealthy environment, because despite being true it would still be badmouthing a previous employer.

&amp;#x200B;

First post.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm in one heck of a pickle and I've kind of accepted that my career is fucked and I'm going to have to start over. I've got a JD but I've been fired three times over the course of the past year. The first time, at a law firm, I was so depressed I couldn't function, which obviously affected my work. As a result, they let me go. Second time, I was doing some temp work. The company I was temping at was purchased by another company. Shortly after we moved into the purchaser's office, I broke a rule I was never informed of and was fired. I finally left the legal profession to do some social service work. I was finally happy. I was struggling with the change in the office culture, but I was taking in the feedback I was getting from my supervisor, working super hard to change, and felt like I was making progress. Then, on Thursday, I was told I wasn't a good fit and was fired. I'm not going to lie, I found it a bit odd that it happened the day after they made an offer to a legal assistant for whom they had no office space. However, regardless of the reasons for my firing, I feel like I have no way to move forward. I don't want to practice law anymore. It made me miserable. I feel like I have no ground to stand on when it comes to a non-law job or a law job alike. What do I do? I feel like, even if I go back to school, no school will accept me because I spent my time after law school jumping from one job to the next. Thoughts?",Well now what?,1
"I recently applied to a job located in an area I am not a fan of. I previously lived in the area on a internship a couple of years ago. It’s in central Florida between Orlando and Tampa. 

I’m from a more rural part of north Florida and that is the type of environment I prefer. But after a year of fruitless job searching I’m considering this job in central Florida. The employer seems really interested in me. They called me the day after I submitted my application, did an informal phone interview, and asked if I was avalible to come down for an in person interview. 

I emailed the interview the soonest date I was avalible (April 1st: I didn’t think this was too far off and it was the soonest I could request off due to my current job) the interviewer emailed me back the next day and asked if I could do a Skype interview sooner to speed up the process. The fact that this job doesn’t seem to have been open that long and they are rushing to interview me is a promising sign I’m assuming? It’s definitely been a 180 from the typical multi week waiting period that I go through with must jobs I’ve applied with.

"I have recently been told by a colleague (who joined the company this calendar year), that she is earning almost 15% more than me. Now, when I started I was not in much of a position to negotiate and was quite flatly told there was no budget to go higher on it. At this point I had a MSc but only a couple of internships to my name, my colleague had an MSc and one year of work experience in a similar company. So to an extent I understand why she would be earning more than me, although I do think the increase is somewhat shocking given she didn't negotiate her deal.  After a year, I was given a 3% increase. I am trying to figure out what to do in this situation, as I feel I am not being fairly compensated for my work. I have been there two years now and am the longest serving member of the team (aside from my boss) by almost 2 years...  I take a very active role in teaching new members of the team (which occurs a lot due to some very high turnover of staff, for varying reasons.. none to my knowledge due to any issues with the company or compensation).  Yet I'm being paid significantly less than a colleague with a year less experience.  


I approached my boss about this on Friday, who has said that I will be getting the usual increase (I am pretty sure it's just an inflation based increase) and that they have a separate pot of money for promotions but that they don't think they can tap into that as it would not be a promotion (I have been turned down for this recently).  They said they are going to ask to find out if there is anything they can do about it as they know it's not much of a motivation.

"I’m 26, graduated university with a Bachelor of Arts in English and completed a Graduate Certificate in Creative Industries and I’m currently unemployed.

I have worked at least 10+ jobs over the years. I’ve worked in retail at various shops, admin for a real estate (I had an awful boss who I hated and made my life an anxiety ridden mess) and I’ve worked in inbound sales. 

My favourite jobs so far have been as a customer service rep for a florist delivery service, but that was temp work. I loved the people I worked with and basically sat behind a computer with a headset answering calls, placing orders, dealing with issues between florists/couriers, data entry, refunds etc, and I didn’t have to push sales. 

My other favourite was as a warehouse assistant, where I worked in pick pack for an online fashion store. Again I loved the people I worked with, and there was no customer interaction, just picking clothes and packing orders and I loved it. You just pumped out the orders and got them out on time, and I was super physically fit. I had to quit because I moved back home interstate.

I’m a creative person. I want to start a little side hustle selling candles online, I write and I sing. But I know I need a bread and butter day job.

I’m with a job agency that genuinely helps me find work and I’ve been set up with a trial next week in a retail position selling evening wear. I’m super nervous because I went into the store to introduce myself to the owner and it turned into an on-the-spot grilling about my lack of stability in jobs, selling, whether I was single or not, why I haven’t stayed in jobs before, if I’d had personality clashes, whether I’d been injured at work before. I’ve never been fabulous in retail and have always had shit experiences in jobs/trials in stores selling stuff. It’s not my natural talent- I’m good at helping people and being productive, not selling. I have intense anxiety around work because I base a lot of my self worth around how well I perform. 
But I guess I’ll see how it goes. 

Admin often bores me, I can’t seem to ‘wake up’ properly because I’m sitting down all day. 

I’ve asked friends and family and they’ve ALL said they can see me easily working in a cafe as a barista. Which makes sense because I love cafes and I love coffee. My job agency has said they can send me for a barista course but they often want you to have experience, so how do you get experience if you’ve never worked in a cafe before and I’m not 16? 

I’ve always thought it would be exciting to work in a creative media agency doing admin/PA work- ANYTHING. People often say they can see me in that environment too- and everyone says I should write for Buzzfeed haha. 

My experience is such a mish mash and I know I have skills but I don’t know where the right place is for me or the direction to head.

My ultimate goals are to start this online business to generate income and have a side creative project, and to write books and sing etc, but I need money and to have some structure in my life. 

It’s all coming to a head because my original plan was to move interstate to Melbourne and start a Masters in Creative Writing that I’ve been accepted to, but the idea of the debt is looming over me, and I need to start setting myself up with some savings and a solid base for my life. 

I’m 27 this year and I don’t want to just be an unemployed mess anymore. I’m ready for some momentum to kick in. ",26 and I need a direction for a day job/career,1
"Thinking about changing careers from an Office Administrative Assistant, as my last two jobs have ended in the gutter.

Job 1) Amazon Re-Seller, very hectic and high turn-over. I put up with it OK until they put me in the warehouse and asked me to pack sex toys and write fake reviews to cover their bad customer service. Not in my job description, quit. Made about $10h/r with zero benefits and no vaction.

Job 2) Hardware Store, great for a number of years had bonus and a raise. CEO retired and sold the company, now every order has gone wrong and new management lies continually. Tons of angry customers both on phone and walk-in. Many of the other employees are already considering leaving, and I'm sitting in the office by myself right now answering calls while everyone is ""out sick"" or ""on vacation"".

"Ok. I wasn’t sure if this was the best place to ask this, but this is the best I’ve found. Here is the situation I’m in:

I work in a field where we staff 24/7. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shift. We are all educated professionals (job required a bachelors degree with extra certification exams). My shift lead just quit. I am one of the clear contenders to replace that individual (one other has a shot at it as well). What the company has decided to do is not hire a replacement, but rather divvy up that persons responsibilities with me and other said person. Not only that, but others who are less qualified and less willing will get “extra pay” for taking on “extra responsibilities” similar to what I would get as well. This is a small portion of what the previous lead had made. This pisses me off for the following reasons. I have taken on multiple extra projects with zero compensation, I’ve answered calls while off duty to help assist. I’ve even driven in to help people in a tight spot. I feel like I’ve consistently gone above and beyond and I’m being lumped into this large category to take over the previous leads roles with little compensation for it....I’m also doing more of the previous leads role then anyone else under this new structure. So my question is....should I ask for a raise?

 one more point in my favor: I am the only person in the whole department (all shifts, encompassing 100 people) that is trained to do literally everything. Arguably making the single most versitile employee (obviously I’m a little bias on that last statement haha)",Should I ask for a raise?,1

"Let me just start by saying I have re-written my long-winded post 3 different times now but keep talking myself out of submitting. In short- I am hopelessly disengaged and uninterested in my well-paying, low-pressure, soul-sucking cubicle job. This is just normal corporate America life, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Sparing you all the details- I have worked at a major oilfield services company for 7 years. I'm in my 3rd job position/ department change in an effort to expedite career progression, gain a higher salary, and leave undesirable dead-end situations. I have managed to achieve most of these things...but the misery follows me. I am now at a point where there is no carrot to be hung in front of me: I don't want more responsibility or work, I am paid fairly, and I don't desire development experiences to learn or know more about this business. I can't pretend anymore to be interested in any of my work and listening to other people get into the weeds about business happenings just leaves me feeling even more at a distance. I am totally jaded from years of watching productive, passionate, loyal people be laid off, the constant org changes, and performance reviews that are another can to kick down the road as a result. I see no correlation between work I'm doing and the company's well-being or my own personal benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe both my mentality about corporate work and what I've seen in this company are to blame. Ask me to talk about how arbitrary mandated work hours are, or how destructive a crappy boss can be to their direct reports, or how demotivating it is to have constant managerial turnover, I could passionately draft an entire novel. But if you want me to complete a task within the scope of my actual job...my focus will be solely on the bare necessities to check the box. I won't entertain a phone call any longer than absolutely necessary to get the job done. I don't want to attend a meeting about it. I don't want to bother other busy people about it. I just want to get it done and go home.

&amp;#x200B;

Another defeatist nail in the coffin- As far as I can tell it's no different at any other company. I would be another cog in the machine just trying to make sure I'm relevant enough to keep a job, but not so engrossed that I live and die to serve a company that would lay me off the second it needed to. I would be pissed off if I had to work any later than 4-4:30 PM and living for the weekends and holidays. Bosses would come and go and I'd have to prove myself over and over and drink the kool-aid. So why change companies? Perhaps to kill some time with the distraction of a transition...only to end up in the same place.

&amp;#x200B;

It may be worth noting - I started my career knowing this was not sustainable for me long term. I quickly adopted financial independence and early retirement ideals as a light at the end of the tunnel. But as a logical-being I am somewhat prisoner to the mentality that the most responsible thing is to save as much money as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

"Hello! I'm 24 (turning 25 this year) and I'm working for one of the top ad agencies in the Philippines as an Account Manager.

This Ad agency where I'm working was already my third job at my age - 1st job I worked as an Account Executive for an Events company; didn't last long because it was my first job and I was overwhelmed at the number of work hours I had to be in the job (Had to do ingress and egress for a telco brand). 2nd job, I was there for 1 yr and 6 months - it was a small ad agency being manned by 9 people. Doesn't pay much but it helped me learn a lot to be resourceful. 3rd and I landed in the agency where I am working now (was pirated; doubled my salary from my previous agency) and I can fairly say that I'm at my happiest 1 year and 3 months of working.

I do got an offer in one of the top ad agencies in Singapore. They're offering me a really huge amount (4k SGD) and while the cost of living in SG is high, it's still a lot of money that I can send here in the PH for my fam.

I’m exploring to see how I can manage to keep my stable income until I can establish my private practice. I am very well aware that this is going to be a multiple year journey.

Also, has anybody managed to keep dual careers?

"Hey Reddit,

I'm currently in the private security work field and have been so for for over 4 years now. I've worked my way up to becoming an assistant account manger and have been making decent money doing so, but times are changing and I'm not advancing in this line of work like I would like too, plus I'm not too happy about having a desk job as apposed to being on my feet and being physical on a day to day basis. 

So in short, I would like to change to a more physical profession, preferably in a trade of some sort (i'm not picky, just enjoy working). I don't mind dirty work like that of a plumber or something super physically bearing like iron worker type labor. Just something that will give me a practical skill down the road is what sounds good to me.

So here is the issue I am running into. I've found postings online that state something along the line of ""This job is entry level"" or ""we will train you"" or ""apprentice needed"" and I've sent them my resume with all the needed information on it. But... I haven't had much luck hearing back from any of the people posting the available employment. I've always understood that entry level and posts with ""no experience required"" mean as such, so I've a but confused as to why I haven't heard back from anyone in the past 2 weeks.

Just to make sure I'm not skipping out on important information, here is a brief out line of my job tiles since I've been out of high school

1. Automotive Tech Assistant - 8 months
2. Assistant manager for a bowling ally + a bit of time as a lane machine technician - 2 years
3.  ""Sandwich Artist"" for subway (The only job I have ever been fired from) - 4 months
4. Private Security Guard - Lead Officer - Assistant Account Manager - 4 + years

I've kept my nose extremely clean for most all of my working life with the exception of my time working in fast food, which I quickly learned I cannot do. With all other employers I have never been late, written up, or suspended. 

I'm just a bit concerned that because my work history is a bit all over the place that I don't come across as a suitable candidate for another employer, let alone one that will have to spend time and resources on training and certifying.

Any advice on this ""starting over"" kind of thing? I'd like to make this new job my permanent one so I can dig my heals in and learn everything I can.

"Hello all. I’m in a cloudy situation and I need some advice.

**Context**

I’m 36 yo. I’ve been working for a IT company for 11 years. I current role is “senior developer”. I am kind of fullstack dev with heavy background in Java/grails, and some experience managing people.

I going to move out to Berlin next year with my girlfriend and my dogs.

My plan is to start improving my resume, and linkedin profile in August. I think that if I do that right now the messages are going to make me distracted. Then I would quit right when I have a good offer.



I think I have **two options**:

* Pursue my promotion before the next job:
  * Pro:
      * It could make my resume stronger
  * Cons:
      * Less focus on all the stuff I need to have ready in order to move out (house, health issues, pets, nationality papers, resume improvement).
* Doing just enough work to meet expectations and nothing more
  * Pro
      * More energy to preparing to moving out
      * It may be easy to enter to a new job as a senior developer ready to promotion, than as a newly promoted project leader


Regarding pursuing a new job, this is a **list of stuff I could learn in order to add to my resume**:

* Languages:
  * Node
  * Go
* BigData
* IA
* Implementing GPRD, fintech stuff
* Soft skills (leadership, team work, communication) &lt;&lt; this is what I really love to learn more about.

**So I have two questions:**

1. Should I pursue promotion before moving out?
2. What should I learn in order to be prepared for a good job offer?
3. Also, any tip could help about my plan and choices

"I’m guessing the answer to this is no, but I’ve never heard of anyone asking so I figured I’d see if anyone has experience with this.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m expecting a job offer this week for a position that, as described in the requisition, is a couple rungs lower than what I’m capable of doing. For the record, the pay is GREAT and there’s room for growth and promotions, so it’s worth potentially starting out with a less impressive title. But at my last interview, the panel seemed pretty excited at the things I could offer that they hadn’t included with the job description. It’s a small team so they could certainly use the help and higher level support than they originally sought out.

&amp;nbsp;

Given that, if they call and offer the job, would it be out of line to discuss changing the actual job title right off the bat? I don’t want to say specifically what the title is on here, but basically it’s “[specific duties] coordinator” and if I’m to take on as much as we discussed in my interview, something more like “[department] specialist” seems more fitting and also less entry-level.

This theater company is also looking to expand into putting together a concert series which is why they value my experience. It is a diverse place which, as a black woman in entertainment, stands out to me. It is a challenging position where I could really make a difference but since it is theater would not push me so obviously towards my ultimate career goal other than that I'd be managing a plethora of people... but I hate California.

**TBD Job Offer #1:** Tour Coordinator for a prestigious classical music artist management company a train ride away from where I currently live has done two rounds of interviews with me but due to their current tour schedule do not anticipate making a final decision until the later half of April. Because of this I could go through with Job Offer #1 for at least one of the three tours I have the option to do with them and if accepted could then switch to this company. I'd be directly responsible for planning the tours for a number of orchestras and soloists in addition to some dance companies as well. Despite being an office job, it would give me a name in this area of the business and put me much closer to orchestral tour management than I ever have been before.

**TBD Job Offer #2:** Production Coordinator for a theatrical touring company on the other side of the country. It involves both office work and doing fly outs to touring productions to ensure all goes as planned. It is by far the most advanced thing I'm being considered for and even though it is a theater job, it involves handling the producing of complex touring shows and would set me up nicely for touring artists/shows in the future on the arena or stadium level... but I hate California.

**TBD Job Offer #3:** This same theatrical touring company is looking to hire touring staff for their upcoming season. It is contract based and could fall in nicely behind the tours offered to me spanning from April-July. In an ideal world I could even work for both of these companies accepting jobs from each and become a full time touring professional which is the most ideal immediate scenario.",Requesting job acceptance advice from the virtual abyss...,1

"I (25M) have no formal degree and stressing the heck out about my education. A few years ago I was able to land a great sales job as an account executive at a software company, and make more than I should without having a degree. While my professional experience (6 years) will be a great platform for the future of my career, without a degree I'm concerned how limited my options might be for getting a job outside of my current company if anything happened there. Or, how limited my options for advancement at my current company and others may be. I've also always felt looked down upon at my work and with my clients for not having a degree. 

So, I did something about it. The past 3 years I've been going to school part time at a community college, and am now about to achieve my 2 year-Associate's degree in Business this Spring and wrap up there. I have also acquired a few other business and sales certifications along the way to help ramp up my professional pedigree. I am in the process of transferring to a 4 year university in the Fall that has a great online degree program that I can take while continuing to work full time.

The only problem is, I'm married, and work full-time. My schedule looks like going to work at 8am, coming home at 6pm, and working on homework most of the evening. I haven't let it become a burden to my marriage since I make sure to spend enough quality time with my wife in between things. While it hasn't been draining to my marriage, it's becoming draining to me. I have little to no personal time, and struggle to find time to socialize with friends and family. I can only dream of living an average life of coming home from work at 6 to relax and spend time with friends, family, or in any way that I want to use my time. My wife and I are also trying to have kids, and in my mind that makes finishing my education an impossibility.

I know that going to a 4 year university will be even tougher than community college has been. Do I tough it out for the next 2-3 years to get my degree, or do I cut it off where I'm at now and enjoy life? Do you think I have enough experience and education to keep growing in my career for the rest of my life? How do I share my concerns with my wife who supports me finishing my education and might view this as me slacking off?

I've been reading articles from HR company like Korn Ferry and consulting firms like Mckinsey, BCG etc and they're all pointing that future job market would be in high demand for ""data savvy"" employees. (people have said that data scientist would be the sexist job in the world in the future).

The problem is that it's pretty hard to convince the HR that you could do data analysis.

I've passed through the exams and got the **Google Analytics Certificate but it doesn't seem enough**. Many Business Analyst job requirements want employees to have experience in ""Tableau"" or could speak R++.

If you learned it yourself, it's kinda hard to prove that you're good at it. Hence my question.

"Just joined and figured I would put in some helpful tips in interviewing and helping to accomplish the goal in ultimately getting the job.  My experience is in management, recruiting, owning my own business and I am writing a book on a similar subject.  My passion is in helping people, so here we go:

Here are some keys
Tell your story- but what does that mean?  You need to paint a picture of you doing the job (to the employer) and you ultimately working there.  To do that, you are going to present your story in such a way that they it makes sense to them of why you are here to interview and why you are interested in doing the job (and working for them).  

Sell yourself in an organized way, tell your story in a way that relates to your background/work history being a perfect transition to THIS job/company.  Have your story straight...what initiatives did you do for your previous company?  What did you accomplish?  How is that going to help you for this company?  What intangibles do you posses that has helped you succeed and will continue to succeed in working for them.  What makes you the right fit?  Have all of this laid out in a bullet point form so you are able to be organized with your story thoughts.  You are trying to build their perception that YOU are the right fit for the positon, you CAN do the position and your the correct choice (over the other competition).  
Here are a few more key items:
1. Know your resume like the back of your hand and have it make sense in the flow of your story.  
2. Know the company, it's mission, it's history etc.  Checkout the website, visit the location beforehand.  This will show the employer that you did your homework (and in turn you will do good work for them).  Learn the job description or what is required of it. 
3. When telling your story, attempt to preemptively answer their questions (example how are you ready to take a step up from Assistant Manager to Manager)...a way to do this would be when telling your story, say to them of the Manager direct responsibilities that you did, that you were manager on duty in the manager's absence.  You have achieved success (in certain metrics (if possible to mention).  
3. Dress to impress, show up with a portfolio and multiple copies of your resume.
4. Demonstrate appreciation at each stage of the interview process. ",Interview Excellence- Tell your story/build perception of the employer that your the perfect fit,1

I was told to do something that wasn’t my job.I’m all for teamwork but the manager son tried to play his Dads role. I can accept  constructive criticism but I do not like being treated unfairly. My job is to prepare chicken in the morning because we sell a lot throughout the day.  And I was told to help the dishwasher do his job by the managers son. I was a little annoyed because the dishwasher agreed that he can handle his job and complete his duties alone. Why should I have to pick up someone else’s slack when I worked hard to complete my task on time? So me and the managers son argued on and off about the situation for 2 hours. Until someone in a higher position told us to stop and that we need to work as a team. I talked to my General Manager about just not working that day. And he is thinking about that approval. Mind you that the dishwasher works in the morning and his job is to make sure everything is taken care of when it comes to dishes and trash. After I have to take over in the afternoon and close dish. Am I Overreacting or should I look at it from a different perspective? ,Being treated unfairly,1

"During my initial phone interview I gave my salary expectations (35-40k) and the recruiter seemed relieved and told me I was right in the range for what they were able to offer. We went over the salary expectations again during the in-person interview and again they seemed to be happy with my proposal of 35-40k. 

About a week later the recruiter called to offer me the position for $16.78/hour. I am admittedly terrible at math and panicked and accepted the offer over the phone, thinking we were on the same page and the salary would add up to somewhere in my expected range. Now that I did the math I realized that 16.78/hr amounts to only around 32k before tax, which is about the same as what I made at my previous position. I’m disappointed that I accepted the offer so quickly and I am wondering if I have any leverage to try and renegotiate before they send me an official offer letter. Is it a bad idea to explain that I didn’t realize that the hourly rate would amount to something lower than I had given as my salary expectation?

I am by no means ""the star"" in the office but I feel I have qualifications for a job I was past promoted for above and beyond the person that was appointed due to that person being the bosses favorite.  I can provide more information then needed but here are the basics: 

1. I have over 14 years of Supervisor / Mgt Experience in my field - I am currently a Supervisor among  four other Sups
2. I seek extra responsibilities at work yet seldom get them other Sups are tasked with  them by my boss
3. I have not been given a performance review in over 3 years due to my boss not believing in them. 
4. My boss has his favorites - Generally people who are outspoken or are interested in hobbies he enjoys. I am more reserved and do not have the same interests.

6. My boss have butted heads in the past in regards to our different management styles but I've always treated him with respect.

8. My boss got a promotion six days ago and will be away to corporate office. He appointed another supervisor to his role here. This person has 1 year of Supervisor experience zero management experience.

I am a 27 year old male who lives just outside of NYC. I have a bachelors degree, work as a police dispatcher, am a volunteer fire lieutenant, and live with my girlfriend (24f – teacher with 1 year left of school for masters) at my parents house. 

I have been trying to get a job as a full time firefighter in a smaller city for a few years now. The reason I took the job as a police dispatcher is because it is supposed to help you get hired, and I needed a job anyway. This is a pretty standard move for people in the emergency service field. I have been here for almost 3 years now and do extremely good work. 

Shortly after I got hired as a dispatcher, the fire department gave out an exam. The way it works is they give out a written test. If you do well on that you get moved to the physical test. If you do well on that you get put on “the list” and now they can only hire off of that list for 3 years. Hundreds of people took the exam. I passed the written test and moved on to the physical, I did amazing on the physical and got a letter stating I was in the top 30 and have made it onto “the list”. They don’t tell you your scores and don’t tell you where you stand on the list. When you get chosen you have to pass a psychological exam and a medical exam. When the list came out they hired 3 people right away bringing the list to 27 guys. I know I am somewhere in the group of 27 but I’m not sure where. 

For 2+ years I have been misterable at my dispatch job. I only take home $2,000 a month which is just not enough for the area I live in and for the work I do. Between bills and just living it isn’t easy. I have $2,000 saved and about $1,000 in credit debt and am working on putting much more into savings. This is also why we are living with my parents. It’s not a terrible situation living wise, but It’s time for us to get the hell out of there. I work long 12 hour days with little to no breaks most of the time, I’m constatly getting forced into work on my days off, I work day shifts &amp; night shifts, holidays,  it’s stressful as hell, I can’t comfortably afford to move out, etc. I could go on and on about why I’m miserable where I’m at but I’ll spare you. I have stuck around because everyone made me believe that If I put in my time I would get the firefighter job and I was willing to do that. Now they just hired over 10 guys -an unheard of amount at one time, and I wasn’t one of them. Soul crushing is a good way to describe how I feel. 

They will be giving out another firefighter exam at the end of this year, and I would have to go through the same process all over again. Because they just hired so many, I would probably have to score in the top 5 to have a shot. I have thought of moving into the actual jurisdiction to get extra points on the test before the next exam but it’s not particularly where I want to live and it would be tight based on what I take home and prices in the area. There are also rumors going around that on the next exam, dispatchers will actually get extra points as well – but the amount of rumors that go on in this place makes it hard to believe anything until you see it. I also feel, for this exam I did really well. I did significantly better on the physical portion than someone who got the job offer ex: in 1 minute, he only did 28 pushups, I did 60. He only did 4 pullups, I did over 10. I am also the only city employee that is on the list and have a great reputaiton here and am well liked. If they wouldn’t pick me now, why would they pick me in another year? 

On the other hand, I want to live in NYC – specifically brooklyn. 99% of my friends live there and a majority of the time we are in the city or brooklyn anyway hanging out. Because I live in New Jersey, I can’t live out of state with this job I have. I am honestly contemplating finding a job as a bartender in the city and then teaching guitar lessons, trying to find some sort of music job, and just living a little bit of a happier different lifestyle. My family was in the bar business for a very long time and I thrive in this kind of enviornment. My girlfriend goes to school in NY so it doesn’t make much difference there, and she would have to find a job soemwhere there to help pay for rent which she is okay with. There are obviously a lot of pro’s and con’s to both sides, but I feel that I have a few options.

1) Move into the place I work. Continue working there and take the next firefighter test hoping that I get into the top 5 and they don’t screw me around.

2) Basically the same as #1, but If I don’t get the job by the time my girlfriend finishes school – be done with them. 

3) Actively look for a job in the city while continuing to work here and putting money into savings. As soon as we both have jobs lined up, move into brooklyn.

"**Original Article:** [**https://mentorcruise.com/learn/guide-salary-negotiations/**](https://mentorcruise.com/learn/guide-salary-negotiations/)

*You nailed the interviews, convinced the hiring manager and are on your way to negotiate your future salary. But how can you put yourself in a good position?*

## Know your worth

Preparation is super important. Use resources like Glassdoor, PayScale or similar and calculate the median salary for someone with your level of experience, in your location.

This will help you manage your own expectations, but also give you a good argument in negotiations (“… but the median salary for someone with my experience is…”).

It will help you to know what you are worth.

## Know their range

Again, Glassdoor might be of help here. Can you find any data on what the company is usually paying for this position? Sometimes, companies will even give a salary range on the actual job vacancy.

Keep in mind, this is what the company is **comfortable** paying. If you want to optimize your salary, think about the top half of the range, rather than the bottom half.

If a company is offer an annual salary that corresponds to what you found out in Step 1, this is the place where you can go from a good salary to a great salary.

## Money vs. Wealth vs. Time vs. Benefits

Cash isn’t everything. Think about the baseline of cash you really need on a monthly basis, and think about other things you could substitute it with.

* **Wealth**: Many companies will allow you to buy stock options and/or equity. This can be a great method to not only live off a paycheck, but build substantial wealth. Big tech employees regularly pay out multiples of their salary due to the rising stock of the corporation, and early startup employees of Facebook, Airbnb and co. are regularly listed on Forbes lists.
* **Time**: Many would argue that the thing more important than money is time. And time can be bought. Many employers will allow you to buy additional PTO days in exchange for a smaller salary. It can be worth it!
* **Benefits**: From healthcare and childcare, to free campus housing and in-office spas. Many companies offer convincing benefits to their employees. Will the free food from the in-office gourmet chef convince you to have a lower salary?

Research all of this beforehand and make a plan in your head of what ranges you’d be comfortable with.

Example:

I'm looking for an annual salary of $150,000 If I can get 35 PTO days, I'd be willing to have a salary of $130,000 

## Keep your options open

Nothing better than leverage. Before going into a negotiation, collect your leverage. That can be:

* Another open offer
* No need to change positions
* Company is known to struggle filling this position
* Unique skillset / value
* Time crunch (position needs to be filled this week, let’s wrap this up)

"So I’m waiting to hear back from a job I interviewed for last week. The interviewers seemed to like me and said not to worry if I didn’t hear anything in a couple of days. They said that it could take 2 weeks for them to make a decision, finalize the paperwork, and then make an offer.

I’m just feed up with waiting after an interview. I don’t see why a smaller company can’t at least eliminate people they don’t find be to good candidates first and then let everyone know where they stand after a couple of days. Ie you were elimainated first round or congratulations its down between you and another person, we will contact you with a final decision in a couple of days, etc. 

I’ve been trying to leave my current job for several months and have went on multiple interviews. It is slightly frustrating to have to arrange to take time off of work last minute to go to an interview on the downlow (in my experiance every time I’ve gotten called for an interview that want to do it the same week with only a couple days notice) just to have to wait multiple weeks for either no news or a rejection. 

What makes me particularly fed up is a company I interviewed for that severely gaslighted me into thinking I was getting offered a position (I applied for one job and the hiring manager said he was going to consider me for two positions and talked about how I’d be such a great fit for either and it would be up to me as to which I would prefer.) They made me do 3 interviews before rejecting me from both jobs via email 3 weeks later.  

Another job I first interviewed for at the end of November and did a second interview in December said they would have a decision by mid Jan. I hadn’t heard anything so I called them back to follow up several weeks ago and was told they were still working on paperwork and finalizing their decision and that someone would call me back with an answer “soon”.  Haven’t heard anything back since. 

I’m incredibly frustrated with my current job and unhappy coming to work everyday. Everyday I get my hopes up that one of the jobs I’ve applied/interviewed for is finally going to call and offer me a new job.

There are multiple subjects and disciplines of study with their own distinct features in the field of allied health. Audiology and Speech and Language Pathology is an allied health science which is directly concern with knowledge &amp; skills to evaluate, diagnose and treat (intervention) disorders, swallowing as well as disability screen &amp; advocacy in individual of any age across life span. It also includes counseling persons with disorders of communication and their family members rehabilitate persons with speech, language, swallowing and hearing disorders prevent speech, language, swallowing and hearing disorders.

Professionals having qualification in speech and language pathology (SLP) are called Audiologist and Speech Language Pathologist. Audiology is a branch of science that studies hearing, balance, and related disorders. Its practitioners, who treat those with hearing loss and proactively prevent related damage, are audiologists. Employing various testing strategies, audiology aims to determine whether someone can hear within the normal range, and if not, which portions of hearing are affected, to what degree, and where the lesion causing the hearing loss is found. If an audiologist determines that a hearing loss or vestibular abnormality is present he or she will provide recommendations to a patient as to what options may be of assistance.

Similarly, speech-language pathology (SLP) is a field of expertise practiced by a clinician known as a speech-language pathologist, also sometimes referred to as a speech and language therapist or a speech therapist. SLP is considered an “allied health profession” along with audiology, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, clinical psychology, physical therapy, and others. The field of SLP is distinguished from other “related health professions” as SLPs are legally permitted to diagnose certain disorders which fall within their scope of practice. SLPs specialize in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of communication disorders, cognitive – communication disorders, voice disorders, and swallowing disorders etc. SLPs also play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorder, which is becoming developmental disorders.

According to Census 2011, there are 2.68 million Persons with Disabilities in India in which 50.71 lakh is hearing disabilities and 19.98 Lakh persons is suffering from speech disorder. In short, Audiology and Speech Language Pathologists are professionally responsible for the assessment and treatment of a broad range of speech, language, swallowing, and cognitive-communication and hearing impairments. Such impairments may result from structural or functional causes, and may have developed over time, or have resulted from causes such as stroke, head injury, or cancers of the head and neck.

 The job ticks most of the boxes I want in a job at the moment.
Permanent, not stressful, casual professional environment, great commute, doesn't place huge demands on me mentally, which leaves me energy to do my own thing.

 It is however really, really repettive and unstimulating. It didn't bother me for the first half a year, because I could listen to music or audio books.

There is very little variety in the role as it is. 

However - I feel that despite making an effort - comming in early, etc, I am basically doing the bare minimum, rather than what I could, if I were more focused.

"Hi, hello! We're new to reddit and we hope this is the right place to post this. 
Before we start:
- We're seventeen, we've never had a job before and we've basically lived most of our life isolated physically (living mostly alone in the woods) and only being able to learn about the world via the internet. Essentially - and we CANNOT stress this enough - we're dumb as all hell, so if the answer to this is obvious to all of you that's why it isn't to us.
- We use the we pronouns for a number of reasons but we'll just leave it at ""we do it for the fuck of it."" We are only one person.

So, we love the idea of working, especially the parts where we're helping other people and get to be self-sustaining and independant. It's Neat!
However, the idea of doing any one particular job for eight hours straight is... rather terrifying, somewhat since we're not entirely sure what to expect. We're mostly afraid of not having the time to do the things we want to do; meeting people and making/hanging out with friends and creating art and exploring this world we haven't really been able to see much of yet. We have no idea if it's possible to do that when we only have autonomy in about 30% of our waking life, and it certainly doesn't seem like it has very much variety...
We thought that maybe we could somewhat avoid this schedule if we could, as the title says, gain a bunch of skills - probably ones like sewing, being able to fix cars, and maybe getting fit enough to do manual labor if that's needed would all be good candidates, as well as learning a bunch of languages to both make moving around easier and maybe we could teach them? Again, we're dumb as fuck and have no idea what we're doing. 
We suppose one of the major obstacles is... we don't know what kind of response this will get but we suppose it's important, we are trans (which has nothing to do with the we pronouns, by the way) and we'd like to get all those Nifty Surgeries someday, and we're not sure if we'll be able to do that this way? With all the traveling and such... also we heard the economy is inevitably gonna suck soon, whatever that means, so like is that gonna fuck with this plan?
Again, don't mind the idea of working, we just don't like the concept of doing one single thing for eight hours. Whose idea was that rule anyways? It seems unnecessary...
If you have any reasons as to why/why not this might not work, and if it's the former, any talents we could develop that could help us, please let us know! Also, if you need clarification anywhere do tell us, we don't really speak to people outside our friends often and it may have hampered our ability to put words together normally, Oops!
If this kind of occupation isn't possible, we suppose we'll go back to square one of being a biologist and proceeding to fuck around with the sacred temple of the human body to give people extended lifespans and cat ears and natural reincarnation or whatever they do in that field. We may ask about that later actually.

"Hi All!   
A little backstory: I worked full-time for 3 years (2 in college, 1 out of college) at a wonderful company but ultimately left because I was offered an amazing opportunity with a different company across the state. I have always worked in this field (i.e. utilities) and do not know how to do my specific titled job in other fields.   
I have only been at the current company for 6 months. I absolutely H A T E it. The company has horrible shortsightedness in all aspects of business which makes doing my job incredibly hard. I am young and a female in a very old and very male industry so I already lose respect points there. I have made pros and cons lists; costs vs benefit analysis and everything tells me to leave. I never felt this way at my old job. I was excited to go to work, I looked forward to adding another month of being there. I only left because of all that was promised to me here at the new company. 

My questions: Does it reflect poorly on me to leave a job after only being there for 6 months? Should I stick it out for another 6 months of miserableness to at least have a year in?

My background: 30 year old, industrial engineer with operations management experience in CPG/food manufacturing. Last year I took the risk to join a small cannabis startup pre-revenue (in Canada where it is legal) and launched products for it.

I am now in talks with an engineering project management company that used to do a lot of work for my previous CPG/food employer. Engineering consulting + installations of equipment.

"So here's the deal.  I've been working in my organization for 5 years.  I've always been seen as someone with a lot of potential.  A year or so ago I had a meeting with the president and my boss at which time I was basically told that I've been doing a great job and as soon as there is an opportunity/option, I would be up for a promotion.  I have basically always been treated as sort of an unofficial team leader who has been given a lot of responsibility and influence.  Then my boss unexpectedly stepped down and was replaced by another department head, who I feel like does not view me in the same way.  

A couple of months ago the moment finally came when the position I had been waiting for was opened up.  It would be a step up for me.  I am qualified and have the experience, I have proven myself here and have a good reputation, I have the support of the team and the external stakeholders as well.  However, last week my boss informed me that while he is very satisfied with my work, he doesn't think that I am the right type of person for the job and that I will not be getting it.  Additionally, since he took over 8 or 9 months ago, my responsibilities and influence have also been dialed back.  It has been very difficult to take.  He did mention that what he would like to do, since he is not offering me the promotion, is to sit down with me to look at my tasks and responsibilities and see what we can change/improve in order to basically throw me a bone so that I don't quit as a result of getting the promotion.  The meeting is tomorrow morning.

Personally there are 3 general topics I feel the need to discuss.

1.  Why has my standing within the team suddenly changed since he took over.  Why have I gone from being someone with a lot of potential who is given extra responsibilities and cool projects to being just some guy in the team.

2. Tasks and responsibilites:  What are the options?  What can we change to ""improve my lot.""

3. My career here in general.  Where does he see it going?  I've been here for 5 years so if it hasn't happened yet....will it ever?  How does he view my future.

I have this weird mix of wanting to tactfully bring up my grievances and basically ask why he seems to not believe in me like everyone else does but also wanting to make sure that we are moving forward positively in terms of trying to find a good path forward for me.

Ultimately, I fear that the change of department heads may have ended my career here and I am also exploring the opportunity of moving on. However, my employer does pay above average salaries for my job and I have a family/mouths to feed so I also need to be able to count on remaining employed and not making myself into a nuisance while I try to find something else.

I put in the hard work and got a Finance degree from a top 10 undergraduate business school. I interned in retail/branch banking and did a sales and trading internship in NYC. When I graduated, I had a job lined up in the capital markets division at a middle market regional bank in a big city. I've been working there for almost two years and from the outside most people would consider me to be a success...

But honestly, I'm miserable. I feel like I'm trapped and don't belong in a corporate setting. My work performance is slipping and I have come to realize that its because I don't care about my job. My bad attitude has cost me my relationship with my boss and coworkers. I've lost their trust due to my rushed work and lack of attention to detail. I'm miserable every minute I sit in my seat and I am miserable until the moment I leave everyday. It sucks going to work on Monday and I start dreading it starting Sunday night. When I took the personality test to get the job, I wasn't honest and I was focused on getting the job rather than showing them who I really am. I am an ISFP.

Now, I'm stuck doing this job that I hate. In between, I worked part-time as a car mechanic because I am a car guy. However, after realizing how the older guys were (they had bad backs, bad arms, bad legs, etc...), I've realized that the trades are not a good way to go, however, I like to make things, create things with my hands and mentor other people. Doing those things make me feel alive and going to the office is like cutting myself with a blunt knife. 

The situation in the office is pretty bad. I don't get invited to lunch anymore and I don't think my coworkers like working with me. I applied to another job that is very similar to this one and they are extending me the offer letter. The pay bump is pretty good, and I'm not sure what I should do. Its in another big city on the east coast and it will be a pretty far move from where I am living now. I am afraid that the result will be the same if I go to this new place even if the work is only slightly more interesting. I'm not sure what I should do and I really need help.

I have a 2 year in Networking Tech and I worked in IT for about 3 years. At the time, I was trying to get out and do something different.

"I’m asking for my husband. So he’s in a unique situation. He just quit a long term mostly enjoyable job in a location he wasn’t really enjoying with a boss that was very demeaning. His career path was excellent and he really loved the overall nature of the job, just wasn’t crazy about the location and the boss he had was increasingly putting him down, etc. Anyway so he accepted a new job 6 months ago with a new company but in the same industry, same path, and a much more favorable location, although his workload is a lot less and he is really a bit overqualified for this position, given that his workload in the first location was probably 20x more intense. So that’s where he is now. 

So keeping all of his possible options open, he now has a request for an interview with an even better company, a more interesting title/position, with a chance for a real increase in pay. Obviously he is going to interview, but what would he tell this new company? He JUST started this new position, and it doesn’t look particularly great and in his favor to be immediately open to leaving this new company, right? Personally I think being honest about everything I mentioned above would be good enough to bring up if they asked him why he wants to leave this new company so soon (he left the first company bc of a toxic boss/he is somewhat overqualified in the new company, possibly even bored?).

"Long story short: I used to work in NYC. When I did the pay was better, opportunities were more abundant, and the companies I worked for were generally more stable (especially since they are in NYC to begin with).

I got really sick of the city and decided to transfer into a remote degree program so I could return to my small town and work there. Ever since then it's been much harder to find jobs (I work in marketing and it's not a strong industry in my area), the pay isn't as good, and I tend to work for startups that aren't profitable. This results in me leaving since I can't survive on the low wages or being laid off due to lack of funds or lack of work.

This, of course, results in me having a lot of short-term jobs on my resume that make me look like a job hopper - Even though I have references from every employer I've had in the area.

I've contemplated returning to NYC, but it costs a little over $500 a month to commute their via train from my town, which is a huge cut of income to lose. 

I'm trying to figure out how I can access more opportunities without having to lose $500 a month.

"This entire situation had began when my boyfriend's father passed away a few months ago. He left no will and there's a complicated family situation. We had discussed relocating as his father's property is in OH because we'd be able to better handle the estate, and because we had discussed moving out of MA where we live now prior to all of this happening. Long story short, he was able to get a job in record time as an old friend of his was looking for someone to fill a position ASAP. He made the move in December. Since I have a steady, well paying job in the career field I had studied so hard to be in, I decided I wanted to stick around here, find a job remotely, and then make the move. In mid-November, I updated my resume and cover letter, and have been looking for a position ever since. I spend hours on a daily basis searching job boards for anything that may be remotely related to my field. I've sent my resume out to local businesses, I've widened the miles of my search range, I'm following up with companies that I send my resume to. I've had a few phone interviews, but they don't seem to progress further from there. Needless to say, it's been a very frustrating process.

My fear is that I won't be able to find a job, or if I do, it won't be in my career path, and I'd have to derail and do something else to pay the bills. I know I can always be looking for other opportunities, but I don't want to end up taking a long break which would push my progress back. A lot of the job's I'm seeing already require a ridiculous amount of previous work experience, and I've only been out of school for 3 1/2 years now. I don't want to be in a long distance relationship with no light at the end of the tunnel as I wait out for a good opportunity.

"  

Let me start by saying I am not looking for people to solve all of my dilemmas. I am simply trying to get a conversation going with people in similar situations and bounce ideas off of one another. 

Like many, I am completely lost with what to do with my career. I feel like I am stagnating and wasting precious time that needs to be put towards working toward a goal/certification/career path.

Me: 25 year old male in Denver with a BS in Biochemistry, INTP, and old soul type (fairly new too, like everyone, so reach out if you're in the area and like being staying active!). Most of my background has been with organic chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry ranging from: working in a lab making R&amp;D polymers, manufacturing pharmaceuticals with Sigma Aldrich (R.I.P), cleanroom/biosafety cabinet certification field service work, and currently I am an analytical chemist performing cleaning validation studies for various pharma clients.  

Now please don't let me be misunderstood, I have a great job and stability that I am incredibly grateful for because not everyone is as fortunate. I am not the ungrateful little shit that I may come off as in this post. However, when I zoom out and look at the types of jobs available to me in this industry with my degree, I find it a little depressing. I feel like I need to do more with my life than be a lab monkey that just follows the same protocol everyday and fills out documentation. I aspire to do more than that but I'm just not sure what. 

My overall goal is to increase my salary, have the ability to work remotely, and somehow garnish more free time (I know, an incredibly lofty, naive, and potentially incompatible statement). I have always been interested in technology and was between choosing a life science or computer science major. I should have gone with the latter but I needed to know what everything is made of and how that works. Now that I am intellectually gratified, I want to focus on the aforementioned goals which don't seem possible given my current trajectory and career choice. I love tinkering with electronics, the arduino/raspberry pi, building my own desktop, and have made my own website. I'm considering getting a certification in python but don't know where that will lead. I always enjoyed making videos with Sony Vegas and playing around in Photoshop so I have also considered getting into Blender to create science related content. Basically, I am very interested in technology and the opportunities it can provide but I can't decide where in the water to dive in. Some areas seem more shallow than the others but I'm looking for the deep end.  If you have been in a similar situation, are in the same situation, or even know a remotely related story please share it with me, thank you! ","Lost in the sciences, let's talk.",1
"I am nearing 40 years old, and find myself in a situation where I likely have to change careers, and may soon move to a European country. I have been working in the restaurant industry for over a decade now after deciding the field I was studying in college (Urban Studies) wasn’t a good fit.

The restaurant industry has some pros and cons, but I’ve put a LOT of steps in in recent years, and industry changes and changing home life mean that it would be advantageous for me to look into a new career. One of the wonderful things about working where I do currently is that I generally get a free beer and enough food to get me through a good chunk of the day, sometimes a full meal.

One way to begin the conversation is to ask, “Over our lifetimes, what do we spend most of our money and/or time on?” then to find careers or industries that offer advantage on those. Certainly housing and food are big expenses, but even things like cell phone bills and TV cable subscriptions are mediums expenses that NEVER go away…

"Hey all,

I'm in a huge dilemma/quarter-life crisis right now. I studied Immunology and Genetics for my undergrad and for the most part, did very average (I'm 0.01 CGPA away from meeting the minimum requirement for most graduate degrees in my locale). I remember back in university, I wasn't able to thrive in such an environment, was probably too undisciplined (being young and dumb), and had a language barrier (English is not my native language). I ended up skipping most of my classes and failed to get any research experience because of my mediocre results. I'm also thinking that my international status at the time was probably a factor as well. Honestly, I'm surprised I didn't fail lol. I regretted a lot of my actions during undergrad and for the longest time (and possibly as a coping mechanism), I told myself after graduation that I'm not meant for science and that maybe I'm better in management or business or whatever. 

Fast forward three years, I'm working in education, mostly administrative and management work. It started okay because it was a new field to me and honestly, I'm pretty good in administrative work (attention to detail and organization) but I feel like the only reason I went into non-science career was because I needed the job to secure my immigration (it's secured now) and of course, I needed to survive. I'm all here by myself, my family is so far away from me and not supporting me financially at all. I'm in Canada btw.

I'm at this point of my life (quarter-life crisis???) where I feel like a zombie, where I wake up and go to work, finish it and go back to playing my PS4 to stress-release. Rinse and repeat. My life feels so empty and I hate work so much, I've been calling in sick more often now and not just because I hate work, I notice it's actually more common for me to get sick now more than ever. My boss has already noticed my decreasing commitment and has had the 'chat' with me, I feel like being laid off is coming pretty soon. Given my work experience, I don't think it's difficult for me to get a similar job somewhere else but I'm so afraid of being stuck in the same limbo again. My boss, friends and colleagues had all told me that despite me denying it so much, that I really miss science and I feel like deep down inside, it's true. At work, while others talk about life and stuff, I actually talk a lot about science with colleagues. My best friend at work dubbed me 'walking wikipedia with an annoying voice' lol. Even my boss told me that I had a very scientific approach to things at work. I'd like to acknowledge that at the end of the day, despite hating my work, my work did taught me a lot of new stuff and I have a newfound interest in aspects of humanities and social sciences like sociology, history, geography, politics, and linguistics (hence why I was dubbed the 'walking wikipedia' because I knew a lot of social sciences as well) but natural science will always be my number one love (even physics that I hated so much in school, *I am missing it so much*). I don't know if I miss all the labs and exams but I really miss the knowledge, talking about it, educating others about it, and perhaps working in it. I remember going down to American Museum of Natural History in NYC few weeks back, I was like that kid who just got his first toy, not even exaggerating, I haven't felt alive and so excited in a long while. 

Anywayyyy, **I am wondering if it's possible at all for me to come back to science after abandoning it for years?** Has anyone been in the same spot? How did you do it? I have my degree but my CGPA wasn't impressive and I didn't have any research experience. I'm trying to be careful with my plan because I'm not getting any younger and I don't want to incur any unnecessary debt. I've been thinking at going into genomics or genetic counseling because I remember back in undergrad that I excelled in genetics and microbiology classes (especially genetics), not so much with physiology and ecology.

"When you are running a healthcare business, you are employing staff to be reliable for long shifts. Health and medicine shifts are generally between ten and sixteen hours long, which means that you are looking after a team of exhausted, stressed staff. The least that you could do is make their lives as easy as possible, and it can be easy to forget that your employees have private lives on top of all of that. Their private life has to slot around potentially unsociable hours that are long, tiring and difficult to manage. Particularly in medicine, shift work is mentally draining as well as physically; when you’re on your feet for hours on end, it’s difficult to keep up with your personal life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dealing with a team that are working long hours in your business means making them as comfortable as possible. One of the biggest hot topics out there is flexible scheduling and how it works for people in a healthcare setting. When your staff get the right control over their own schedules, they can achieve a much better work/life balance. This balance can directly improve job satisfaction, and this is what you want to provide for your staff; especially if you aim to retain them. Healthcare staff need to feel comfortable in what they are wearing on long shifts and as their employer it’s up to you to ensure their comfort, and you can do that by placing an order at [UniformsAndScrubs.com](https://UniformsAndScrubs.com) to buy scrubs in bulk. Another way to help your staff to survive longer shifts is to help them to balance their hours better and introduce flexible scheduling so that you can give them some control over their shifts. There are tons of ways that you can help your shift workers to survive those long hours, and we’ve got six suggestions for you:

"TLDR: Currently a stay at home mom(SAHM), wanting to go back to work, but have no career goals or aspirations. Need some advice on what I can do.

I've never known what I wanted to do... ever. I have no strong career goals, aspirations, paths, etc. and need some help here on thinking of a career trajectory. I am 26, have a BA in Law &amp; Society with a minor in Criminology and Delinquency, and have been in assorted jobs totaling over 11 years in customer service. I enjoy working hands on with people, being physically active, and busy. I am a very quick learner and love anything creative. I'm not particularly skilled in any facet of the arts (can't draw, can't paint, not good at graphic design, etc.), but I'm great at copying ideas and creating things. I've been the star employee everywhere I've worked, but have never been happy.

My recent job history and reason for leaving include:

* Uhaul (3 years) - Left to pursue a career using my degree
* Receptionist at a law firm (1.5 years) - Left for a job earning more money and more advancement opportunities
* Consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton (1 year) - Left for a job closer to home (commute was 1.5 hours one way). Also hated the government consulting aspect and feeling lesser-than/subservient to government employees
* Paralegal at same law firm as listed before (2.5 years, current part time) - No advancement opportunities, bad work environment, no personal/career skills growth opportunities, limited monetary growth opportunities

I quit my job as a paralegal/went very part time due to daycare issues and have been mainly a SAHM for the last 4 months. It isn't what I expected and I find myself very bored during nap times and needing adult interaction. I'd like to go back to work, working full time, making more than what I was earning ($50k) because the only open daycare facility is about $1,500/month, so anything less than $50k/year would only net me about $1,300/month and in my mind that's not worth it. I will not go to a cheaper in-home daycare as my last experience was horrendous with illegal practices and I'm not willing to chance it again.

"I was contacted for a contracting opportunity by a headhunter in November for a job I applied for back in September. The headhunter confirmed my interest in the position and then told me she would get me logistics once she had them and to notify her when her client contacted me. Her client reached out to me with a contractor agreement and background check authorization a day later. Several weeks later I was notified I passed the background check and was provided with final boarding documents. I was also informed by the company that a work order would be generated once I was onboarded as a contractor. I submitted these documents including a direct deposit form on December 7th. Since that date I have heard absolutely nothing from the company. I've waited patiently most days but on several days have been persistent in contacting someone. I got a hold of the person handling the engagement a few weeks before the holidays and he acted as if he had no clue what I was referring to when I asked for the status of my work order and said he has been on PTO.

"Though I know there are numerous articles about leaving your current job for greener pastures, but I would like to know your opinions and experiences on this. 

And ultimately I would like to seek your advice. 

I’m currently 25 years old, working in a small NGO for a couple of months now. I like my team, my job and the challenges that my current position poses, but at the same time I don’t think I’m in the right place. It’s something that I’ve felt since Day 1 but thought it was a phase since I shifted from corporate to social work-related and I’m getting a lower salary. Still, the feeling persists. I barely get quality rest since I work Monday to Saturday and sometimes I come in on Sundays when the need arises. Aside from that, I feel demotivated by my environment... it’s a really long dramatic story that my teammates and I were unnecessarily caught in between the tension between management and the previous holders of our positions. I guess it has deeper roots than what we see right now but our current team has been negatively affected by this, both on the job and outside of it. 

I think that my recent job has taken a toll on my mental health. I’ve been feeling more anxious and my crying spells and breakdowns have increased. I’m not sure if it’s just a matter of properly managing stress or it’s a telltale sign to exit.  

It’s not my first job. I’ve graduated BS Psychology. I worked in recruitment for a year and another year and a few months for project management of an event by an affiliate of my current workplace. My previous employments have ended because it was project-based so I didn’t have to resign to leave. I’m afraid that I might be labeled a jobhopper if I decide to leave early in the game or if I’ll be wasting my time, energy and life force should I decide to stay. I’m also afraid of leaving the promise of learning opportunities on the job and the progress of the cases I’m handling, but at this point, I don’t know if it’s still worth it. Should I just “suck it up” or should I leave?

I’m running in circles in my head so I’m really sorry should the answer be too obvious or should this whole thing be confusing. I haven’t really fully confided this to anybody yet since I worry a lot that the things I share might be spilled or that they see the subjects concerned or the organization in a negative light.

"I currently live in Japan with my wife and daughter. I work as an English teacher, though teaching English overseas is more of a stopgap than a full time career.

"Good afternoon folks.  First time posting here, and I'm hoping to have some discussion on a topic that's been gnawing on me for at least six months.  There's a TLDR skip at the bottom if that interests you.

About four and a half years ago I started working at a company that I finally felt comfortable with after escaping a career that chewed through employees like expendable cogs in a machine.  My new job was in a different field than I had experience with but the duties were similar and i was -good- at it.  When I started to experience health issues related to my workplace (the lights were giving me terrible migraines and eye fatigue) they got me into one of the first work from home teams so I can continue working without my quality of life or work quality suffering.

It was at this time that there was a management shift, and you can imagine where this is going.

My request to have my work hours moved to an earlier time bloc (so I could go to doctors appointments without taking time off) has been pending approval for over a year, and I'm secretly suspecting that my supervisor never actually submitted my request. Quality reviews for work being done have almost universally downward trending since the management changes and appear to be wholly dependant upon the person reviewing my work as the one time that someone else did the review they had nothing but shining recommendations.  In addition, in instances where I've caught the quality reviewer making mistakes in their findings (example, giving me a negative score for a quality standard that wasn't in force at the time the work was done), I'm given zero back-up by management despite having proof of the mistakes.  These annoyances have become full-blown warning sirens as the company's national offices announced layoffs despite my department having some of the busiest months in recent memory.  Overtime is being offered daily, almost to the point where one could put in for overtime at virtually any time of day and have it be approved without having to check and see if its being offered. In summary, the workplace (virtual, if not physical) is showing a lot of signs that it's in danger of getting axed.

I'm really, really lamenting the current state of affairs as this was a job that I liked and a company that I loved, and to see it devolve into this is heartbreaking for me.  But that heartbreak morphs into dread at the thought of going job hunting now.  I hold no illusions that the job I have is great on paper, with good benefits in addition to being understanding enough to allow me to work from home for my health.  Looking at the job market now I see there's some interesting prospects but what I fear is what isn't advertised in the job posting.  I'm at the point in my life where I can't exactly afford to make many more career changes and have any hope at a reasonable retirement.  I've also got the good old American tradition of big debt/little savings that keeps the filthy peasants desperate for any break from the corporate masters at the plantation house.  The thing that prevents me from even putting my resume out there is the likelihood that any place I would go to is just as likely to be as mired in corporate BS without offering the benefits I need for my health.

Hi. Hello.  I'm currently having a mental breakdown.

The cause of said career-related breakdown necessitates some background. I have been studying maths and physics for the past 4 years while at the same time meddling in and out of a volatile affair with the arts.

I am currently in my last year of high-school in Europe  at a ""regular"" high-school ( as in no emphasis on arts whatsoever, in fact I stopped studying art in grade 10 so 2 years ago, not that I ever learned anything in those classes whatsoever).

When I was little I enjoyed drawing and painting so I took some classes for roughly 1 year when I was about 6 or 7, never thinking of the future of such artistic endeavors. Later, as a pre-teenager and teenager my narrative for a perfect life became synonymous with an outstandingly successful career, specifically in the technical realm. I fell in love with astronomy( I almost broke the bank in order to buy myself a fancy telescope), then came math, physics, then astrophysics and then my biggest \*completely irrational\* dream was to work at NASA. Later I fell out of love and felt really guilty about it, but didn't stop studying either out of inertia, routine or just the thought that it was the only option available .And the point to be made here is that I am decently GOOD at those subjects (math and physics), I have worked so  hard, spent many hours on practice problems, studying,competitions, homework etc, because obviously that was MY path, I was certain of it. Until I wasn't anymore.I got back into art. I felt out of touch with a part of me, a more humanitarian, sensible part so art was my refugee. I started drawing and painting again, I picked up a guitar and started learning and I'm loving it. It's very hard to grasp my artistic abilities, I would say I'm rather decent for someone with 0 training, but my approach to it is rather intuitive. I look at a lot of art, I follow artists on social medias,I can kind of self-teach myself by a lot of practice in a way that works for me.

Now, I don't know what to do with my life. I have been having these breakdowns for a while, crying, stressing myself out over which path to choose. I have invested SO MUCH (money-for private tutorings, time, mental energy, work) into my ""technical career"". This summer I am ""ready"" to apply to University to study Computer Science. This is basically what my education so far prepared me to do. Were I to apply to the Art University... I would obviously need to drop everything and I mean EVERYTHING I have worked on so far, start art courses (provided by the university, that also cost a not-so-negligible amount of money ) and pray for Providence from above.

I would love to be a tattoo artist. But also a astrophysicist. Or a software engineer. Or a particle physicist. Or a mathematician. Why, o why can't I be all? The modern day Renaissance Man...well Woman actually.

One big factor too is the pay - it's not great for the level of skill and work involved, but we have good benefits and a pretty chill work culture.  I'd like to earn more as I have a family to support now and I don't want to keep on working there and feel stuck down the road.  I've been interested in data and do some data reporting for my current job (very rudimentary descriptive stats).  There's an online degree program in applied statistics that I just applied to and barely got in (I provisionally got in due to me begging ;).  I think they think my humanities background is too flimsy for the type of work involved since the last math class I took was over 15 years ago (!) and it was never my strongest subject.  The first course will be a SAS course, which I am told is 'brutal' (more because of the teacher than the material, but who knows).  Couple questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Am I crazy for doing this?  It's a completely different field and I am a little nervous that I'll fall on my face.  Work is paying for it, but catch - I have to make a B or better plus I need to give them two years of service afterwards or else i'll have to pay them back (not so worried about that - i could swing the money if needed).  
2. If I decided I wanted to change jobs/careers to do something more with data, would a graduate certificate help me get my foot in the door, or will jobs see my background in humanities and think that I wouldn't be suitable?  
3. Am I jumping from the pot into the fire?  So  many people change because they do not like their jobs, but I'd want to change in order to grow more - earn more money, growth potential, etc..  Is that a bad reason?  

I am excited about the program and feel that it would even be helpful to my job now somewhat (although that level of skill wouldn't necessarily be needed).  Thanks for insight! ",Am I crazy? Doing graduate certificate in something completely different,1

But on the first day of training when I got there I found out that I would have to work my way up for months. (Something they never told me). The girl who was training me basically didn’t train me at all but show me the seating chart and expect me to start seating people for her and do her job for her. Half way through my training shift she leaves for her one hour break because she’s pulling a double.. so I’m left alone with the cashier who is rude and quite annoying.. basically I was promised to be trained and I didn’t at all... not to mention the manager completely doesn’t care about you and only cares about how the costumer views them.

I am looking for advice. I have a good stable job, not too far from home (20-minute drive). My colleagues are nice and we have a lot of perks.

"I'm hoping to both vent a little bit and to get some advice on what to do. I am a staff accountant in the Chicago area and I recently found out that my two co-workers (both staff accountants) are making more money than I am. A little bit of background:

&amp;#x200B;

I am 30, hold a masters in accounting, and am a CPA. I worked 3.5 years in accounting for a pension fund (not much corporate accounting) then worked for one year at a corporation (public corp) before moving to my current job because I wanted a higher salary. I've worked at my current job for over a year now. Though it is challenging, I do enjoy the work. I've gained a ton of experience in forecasting/budgeting along with month-end/quarter-end close. I was originally the new accountant working with one staff accountant who was there for 3 years and a senior accountant. who was there for 4 years.  The company hired another staff accountant a month after they hired me, so there were 4 of us. While I was on my vacation break this summer, both the 2 yr staff accountant and the senior accountant quit. This left me as the most senior employee and I stepped up. I put in a lot of extra time trying to support the company and keep us afloat until they hired a new employee.

To make the long story short, they hired a new employee after two months and I was tackling on the harder stuff while also training him. The other staff accountant occasionally comes to me with questions. I am basically the person they look to for leadership, which is fine with me. All my managers noticed the work I was putting in and how I was taking the extra time to train the new employee and they told me how they appreciated it.

One day, I was on my computer and came across invoices from the staffing agencies for all the accountants. I wasn't supposed to have this information, but curiosity got the better of me. I found out that the other two accountants were being paid a lot more than I was. My salary is $65K, the accountant who started around the same time as me is making $70K, while the new person I'm training now is making $79K! I just feel a bit betrayed considering the long hours I put in and the two other people come to me with help. The new person I'm training hasn't even earned the CPA and their job experience is not greater than mine. I don't blame the other two co-workers for being much better negotiators than I am, but what can I do?

How do I start a conversation about money to my managers? Should I bring it up in the next review? There was talk that they might make me a senior accountant in due time, but it's a bit strange that two non-CPA's make more than the only CPA in the building. Do I have a just reason to want a raise?

I just have a way of getting things done without thinking them through.

I want to write a blog about that, not me giving advice but reviewing and pointing readers in the direction of self-help individuals. I know that will take some time.

Commerce is a well-liked stream among HSC (10+2) students in India. Having considered Commerce in Class 11-12 allows students to choose from a large number of options at Graduation level, paving the way for a range of career choices. One of the foremost advantages that Commerce students have above Arts students is that they are qualified for both Commerce and Arts courses. Selection of courses after 12th for Commerce students be it academic or vocational, at the time of college entrance is important. It must be a well-versed judgment taken after having complete understanding of the course one is opting for.

Another point to remember for Commerce students is that, while Accountancy, Business Studies and Economics are main subjects, Mathematics is elective. Thus, Commerce stream can be characterized into two groups, Commerce with Mathematics: Accountancy, Business Studies, Economics and Mathematics, Accountancy, Business Studies and Commerce without Mathematics: Economics and Computer Science, Political Science, Sociology, Hindi or any other subject is being offered instead of Mathematics. So, if you are attentive of your interests and which way you just want to go, things might appear a bit easy.

There are number of courses to choose from based on your specific interest. But our experts here in CEDP Skill Institute have tried to cover a small number of major courses for the commerce students. Below is a list of some of the major courses that commerce students can choose after their 12th Commerce standard.

&amp;#x200B;

* Bachelors of Commerce ([B.Com](https://B.Com))
* Bachelors in Economics
* Bachelors of Business Administration (BBA)
* Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS)
* Chartered Accountancy (CA)
* Certified Financial Planner (CFP)

I've been working as an automotive mechanic since I was 18 mostly because I needed money and didn't know what else to do at the time. I didn't go to college because I don't seem ""love"" anything enough to want to devote my entire life and $50-100k worth of student debt to it. My favorite thing of all in life if I had to pick one is making music but that doesn't exactly pay the bills. I struggle to find bandmates who are willing to commit to it and practice so I essentially don't play live aside from the occasional open jam session or something. Even though I'm an above average mechanic I don't ever seem to get paid much for it. I'm a private pilot, drummer, blues guitarist, do electronics bench work for a local radio station occasionally. 

Since I'm sick of being an underpaid, underappreciated mechanic I decided to try and get my commercial pilot certificate with the goal of being a CFI part time.

I hardly flew at all for two years following to save money for this and it's not working at all. Meanwhile a friend of mine goes off and buys an airplane more or less on a whim with no knowledge of airplanes at all. He's currently happily flying it to his private cert.

I do the research, learn everything I can, work hard, and still it seems like circumstances continually work against me every time I try to be anything but a mundane boring person who goes to my garbage boring job day in and day out without asking questions.

When people ask me what I'm good at I usually have to say ""just about anything I really work at.""

My biggest problem is I don't want to do ONE thing, I want to do EVERYTHING. Why only do a few things when you can do everything? It's frustrating to feel trapped in a life where I'm stuck doing such boring things everyday.

"Hi everyone, I was hoping to get some advice on an upcoming phone interview that I have.

Background:

I am a 28 year old recent graduate (Masters of Finance) who is currently in the process of looking for a job in the finance industry. I am located in NYC. One of my dad's business partners happens to be close friends with the CEO of one of the larger Fortune 500 companies, and he was nice enough to reach out and ask if his company might have a job for me.

Last week I met with the company's head of human resources for over an hour. Unlike a typical job interview where the role you are applying for is clearly established, and you know what type of questions to expect from the interviewer (""tell me about yourself"", ""what are your greatest strengths/weaknesses?"", etc.), the interview took on a format  more like a business meeting. Only for about the first 10 minutes did we discuss my resume (specifically I was asked to explain what I had been doing for the past three or so years), before he asked me what job role/position would I like with the company. The role I asked for is finance-based and I had conducted a thorough financial analysis of the company prior to the meeting. For the remaining 45 minutes of the meeting we discussed the current state of global financial markets as well as the company's financials in detail. At the end of the meeting he indicated he would arrange to have me speak with the company's Head of Corporate and Business Development, who heads the division my job role would fall within. We then walked down the hall where he introduced me to the company's CEO, who I met briefly. The next day I received a phone call from his assistant who invited me for a phone interview with the head of corporate and business development.

The phone interview is scheduled for today at 5:30 pm (9:30am for interviewer). The head of corporate dev. is currently in Australia, which is why the interview is over the phone. I have already researched the company's financials, strategies, goals etc. extensively but I was wondering if anyone has any advice regarding a telephone interview of this nature. Obviously, it is uncommon that a phone interview follows an in-person interview and even more uncommon that the interview process is conducted by senior leadership executives of such a large company. The person I will be interviewing with has experienced an extremely successful business career, having held leadership positions at several of the world's premier investment banks. What can I do to make a great impression and how should I approach a telephone interview with such a senior level executive?

I apologize for the length of the post but I felt I needed to include details, given the uniqueness the situation. I appreciate any advice I can get.

"Not sure sure if this is the right place to discuss this but would like to hear your opinion or recommendations for my situation. I'm originally from Colombia and have been working in the US for the last 3 years after graduating from a tier one University in the US. 

26 yo, I have two bachelor degree, one in chemical engineering the other in philosophy from a tier one University in the US. Currently have 50k savings, I'm currently working as a process improvement manager for for a big manufacturing company with a salary of 80k per year in Texas.  Things have been really good with my career since I graduated college almost 3 years ago. 

The problem is that I was able to work in the US under a temporary visa that will expire in May 2019. My company will try to sponsor me but since the h1b visa I'm trying to apply is based on a lotery there is less than 20% chance that I'll be able to get the visa. 

As a result it is very likely I'll have to leave the country and resign my job in a couple months. The job market in my country is really bad and I don't want to move back to my country of origin. 

At this point I'm don't know what to do with my life  and the next step to take. 

One option is to apply to graduate school, I always wanted to get an MBA but that will eat all my savings specially if I choose to do it here in the US. 

the other is to look for jobs in other countries where I could apply but I know the situation with visas will be very similar and a challenge to get a high paying job as a foreigner. 

I would like to hear your advise and if any of you were in a Similar situation...

"My predicament is that I am in the first role of my career, and it has been approximately a year. I am actively looking to leave, but feel that it will be very difficult to find a new job of equal or better pay after only one year, especially if I don’t leave on good terms.

However, my position has me working on over 100 mid-long term projects with customers. There will never be a “good” stopping point, and having to redistribute all of these projects will be chaotic not only for the company, but for the customers as well.

"Hello,

This is my first post. There is a sense of urgency to it. 

I was laid off unexpectedly when my role was moved to India, in November this year. It threw me off balance completely, since there was no indication whatsoever, right up until the day I was told my role was moved offshore. I was promised that this was not because of my performance (which was repeatedly mentioned over calls and on email, to be very good) but a business decision. 

I now have a potential interview coming up this week. 

*How do I handle the question of why I left the earlier company. I feel horribly embarrassed to say I was fired, or laid off, particularly since I’d been with the company for so long, and no other alternatives were offered. 

(I’d been with this IT global behemoth, in one of their corporate (non-billable) functions for about 9 years, and in my last role for 2 years). 

For a brief background: this was a new team being formed, and there was a bit of restructuring happening. My role moving offshore being one of them, as I learnt. 

Will it reflect negatively on me, that I was not offered any other options/ roles given that I was a fast tracker, with goods ratings all through my career? My performance in the last role was also recognized not just by my managers, but the executive leadership team as well. I can furnish proof, and the department head who let me go will provide recommendations as well, if needed. 

But I still can’t shake the feeling off, of being a failure, and I am wondering if potential employers will also look at it that way. 

Please help with advice on how to tackle this question at interviews? 

Thank you!

"Hello everyone. I am a 28-year old female. I currently work in the exciting world of \~finance\~ as a private wealth underwriter. I've been in this career since I graduated (almost 7 years now). 

I am now at the point in my life where I hate my work. I wake up everyday, and I DREAD heading into the office and just being in front of the computer, crunching numbers, and writing up loan documents. There are some days it gets so bad, I often want to get into a minor car accident - not enough to kill me - but enough to give me an injury (broken arm maybe?) so that I can just lay in the hospital bed and not have to go to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

What stops me from just leaving my career now, if I'm completely honest, is money. As a 28 year old, I make almost 6 figures, so I know if I stay in this career, my income will only continue to grow. And the work/life balance is actually pretty great also. My manager is one of the best and I absolutely love her. She is very supportive of her team. I am allowed to work from home anytime I need to. Once I was dealing with some personal/family issues, so I asked my manager if I could work from home for a whole week, and she had no issues with it. I really appreciated her for that. On top of all this, I am currently the breadwinner between my husband and I. And should we choose to have children in the future, I would most likely be the one staying at work while he took care of the children at home. The weight of this responsibility and to earn a certain amount, again, is what keeps me here.

Outside of those reasons ... I feel no joy in my job. I have **no purpose**. I hate when people talk about work with me. And I am often jealous when I meet people who love their jobs. I get really depressed when I think about my future with this job, and that I have to do this for the next 40-something years until I get to retire. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to change my job, I would want to go into either Couples/Marriage Counseling or becoming a Wedding Planner. I want to help couples achieve their goals, whether that's before marriage or after. I love to see growth in people. While working in my current career, I mentored a lot of junior analysts, and I absolutely loved it. I loved seeing them grow. I loved seeing them gain more confidence. And I loved seeing them progress in their careers. On the wedding planning side, I remember I had so much JOY and so much FUN while planning my own wedding. Even though I would be up late researching random wedding things, I loved it. I also helped plan my best friends wedding and that was so much fun and she was super thankful for me helping her wedding dreams come true on such short notice (she got engaged and had the wedding in 3 months).  I think if I could achieve being in a role where I could do either of those things full-time, I would be much happier.

However, I've done my research, and my qualms with the career change is again: money. I know becoming a licensed counselor will take time. It will required a master's degree (yay student loans ...), as well as low-paying internships to start that career. And I know starting off my pay will be low. Much lower than what I'm making now, and lower than probably what my starting pay was in my finance career. And it will probably take years and years to build up a practice where I can be making a similar income to what I am now. I also know becoming a wedding planner would also be a HUGE pay-cut. Although I don't really have to go back to school for this job, I would definitely have to work a much lower paying job to get my foot in the door. And although I could eventually work my way back up to my current pay, that would take 10+ years of being in the wedding industry to get there. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess ... I'm at a huge crossroads. Should I just take the leap and go for a new career. I may get paid less, but I could potentially be much happier and fulfilled in this life, and for once look forward to my job. Or do I stay in a job I hate, but that pays well, the benefits are good, and the work/life balance is great? ",I'm thinking of completely changing my career ... should I?,1

The problem is I don't think I can handle going straight to College for that without first spending some time studying Math and Computer Science on my own and preparing myself so I can be successful in getting the Diploma. Around where I live it's super competitive and the programs are very challenging.

I currently am in the advertising industry (speficially digital marketing) by choice after a switch from the IT industry that was my background.

"Hi all,

Would love some advice. I'm 27 years old and have been writing since I was a kid. I had a play produced professionally on Arena Stage in Washington D.C. when I was in 9th grade. I graduated from college with a degree in English (w/ a poetry writing concentration), and International Relations. After that I went reported for a newspaper, and then freelanced for publications like The Atlantic, NPR, Washington Post, etc. I was offered representation from an agent about a year ago for a book.

And then, because I needed stability and because of various health issues, I took a communications job. It just hasn't been the best fit for me but I've also been struggling with depression and anxiety and don't know how much that's coloring my experience. I feel like I've really lost my way I don't know what I want to do next or what my way out is.

I'm currently doing a Master's in poetry at a really prestigious program, but I don't feel like I fit in with the people there and haven't been fully enjoying myself. I've been wondering if I've been trying to make a career out of writing because I feel like I have to. Or if it's just the job. Or just personal issues.

I've been spending some time these last few months thinking about what I think I'd like to do instead and paying attention to the things that make me happy. I think I've always based my career aspirations off of what I liked the idea of, rather than what I'd actually like to do. My parents always wanted me to be a teacher, and while I enjoy kids, I don't think I'd enjoy bossing them around or teaching the same lesson plan year after year. Also, I just don't have the energy to deal with kids these days.

We were talking about how users use our website at a meeting today and it reminded me how much I like design and how passionate I am about usability. I love creating beautiful experiences for people (and not necessarily in the event planning type of way). I also do love telling stories and using my imagination. I'm going to try to get back into acting and see how much I enjoy that, even if it's just as a hobby. One of the things I enjoy about the idea of acting also is the community and the sense of a team working together on something which doesn't happen at my current job.

Honestly, I could find things to be happy about in any job, so that's making me lazy about actually doing anything.

"So...I'm being faced with what most people would consider to be a great problem, but is driving me nuts.  I currently work for an organization that I respect, and love coming to work each and every day.  I have an amazing boss, make good money, set my own schedule (more or less), and have a lot of freedom in how I do my job.  However, a recruiter called me out of the blue, telling me that he's working with one of my current company's direct competitors.  Under normal circumstances, I will tell the recruiter I need an exorbitant amount of compensation, and they usually go away.  In this situation, however, the recruiter gave me the potential comp package, and I listened.

The short of it is this: I received an offer, with base compensation being similar.  There's a large signing bonus involved, and large bonus potential.  Year 1, I should probably make 20% more in compensation at minimum, and Years 2 and beyond, compensation could be 50-60% more than what I would make at my current job.  Furthermore, the job is a *major* promotion from where I'm at now, and I wouldn't be able to be at the offered level of responsibility in my current company for at least a couple more years.

The difficult part for me is that my manager is a mentor to me, and one of the best managers I've ever had.

"Hey Reddit!

I just graduated from university with a marketing degree in July, and found a job in company A as marketing assistant in October. 

The pay is reasonable, good colleagues, good bosses who would give me different opportunities to grow. The only thing I can complain about is the simplicity of tasks - I know it may be too early for me to judge, but I find my role to be too relaxing, and foresee that it will continue to be. I can always squeeze an hour or two to slack off everyday and leave work on time. Which is not common for an average marketing position in my country.

As I was planning to stay in this role for long term (because it's so comfortable!), a company that I interviewed long before and rejected me, gave me an offer. They say the previous candidate had left hence the position becomes available. Let's call it company B.

Company B is the one I wanted to get in the most when compared to other offers, because of its a well known brand and the dynamic position. This time, I talked to company B's marketing manager about the available position, and from what she described the position is what I want - high exposure (a regional role!), challenging, demanding. But with same salary, and the next salary review would be 2019 March.

For me, learn and growth are the most important goals at this stage. I am worried that if I get too comfortable in a position I will become lazy and not as competitive as other graduates. 

In short,
Company A is relaxing and with better employee benefits. But very easy and slower chance to grow (hotel industry). 

Company B is challenging and exciting. Opportunities to travel overseas. More chance to grow (FMCG). But more overtime occasions and may not have colleagues/ bosses as friendly as in company A. 

To be honest I prefer company B but I'm worried it will be a mistake. Should I listen to my heart (company B) or be more sensible and stay in company A?

"First of all, forgive me if I've posted on the wrong subreddit. If I did, please do let me know so I can repost this elsewhere.

So, I'm from Malaysia and studied software engineering at a local private university, the 4 years of uni life had me up and down in terms of interest within the IT industry. Inspired by all the 'new era online entrepreneurial success' and all the hype around Mark Zuckerberg and his brainchild, Facebook (the movie ""The Social Network"" was released during the end of my studies in secondary school),  I've entered the software engineering course with bright eyes and a thirsty mind to fill with knowledge and skills. 

As I've progressed throughout the program, my interest towards the IT field slowly diminish as shown in my results and amount of effort I put into my school work. That was definitely partly from my core attitude where I am quite a lazy person.

However, I managed to graduate with a CGPA of 3.0 over 4.0 while at the same time feeling bored looking at codes all day long. Despite that, I managed to land a job in an IT firm developing back end systems for corporations.

6 months in, I am feeling bored of the mundane day to day task, I moved on to another job paying me to market/ sell a new loyalty program app for F&amp;B retailers. At the moment of joining the new company, I felt excited to be able to explore the digital marketing world. However, things weren't how I thought it would play out, my goal wasn't aligned the boss's goal and I quit after 3 months.

Having no job in another city out of home, I drove for Uber for a living as I've bought a car for my previous marketing/ sales job. After a couple of months of job search, I landed a job in an IT chain store company for a position in digital marketing under the marketing department, this is another job I entered with my eyes wide open hoping for the best. At this point, in my 3rd job, my salary has been stagnant and the benefits were lower than the company from my first job, this made me feel shitty and worthless for not taking the path I've already opened the door to. 

3 months in, same thing happened, I moved to another company as an in house digital marketing executive which I quickly found out was a family business, the job was chill but it gave me no career advancement opportunity nor any challenge.

I stuck it out there for a year and 6 months, finally landing a job in a digital marketing agency where I learn shitload about digital marketing, but this agency serves small businesses, so money was tight here.

8 months in, I found out that the grass is greener on another larger scale company serving huge clients and here I am now as a digital marketing executive with 8 months agency experience with a better pay and larger responsibility.

So to recollect, I've worked for a total of 3 years and 4 months at the time of writing (currently 5 months in working in the latest agency) at 6 different companies. 

It has been a real shit storm these couple of years without much of a pay grade hike, it has been demotivating and depressing that my actions has caused multiple setbacks in my career. 

Now, I'm actively trying to put 110% into my current job asking for more responsibilities and not saying no to colleagues and superiors passing on tasks to me. Unfortunately, I've not been coping very well with the added responsibilities and I've been skipping exercise and meals trying to complete my work which I'm doing at a very slow pace due to my lack of fundamental marketing knowledge. Experiencing the creative industry has been a roller coaster to me, I don't know what to expect, I don't know what is expected, and most importantly it's totally opposite from the core of my background which is technical skill based. 

I  wish to succeed in this industry but I have issues understanding the fundamental communications within the marketing and advertising realm. 

I would appreciate any advice from any fellow Redditors.

"Finding a new job is like getting a new boyfriend/girlfriend.  You need to be confident, not desperate.  A cool indifference seems to work well, but careful toeing the line between attentiveness and neglect.  

Keep in mind that you are always more marketable when you’re taken.  Never search for a new job or a new significant other until you have found an upgrade because truthfully, nobody wants someone who’s unemployed or forever single (red flags galore).

And as a general rule, the more attractive the job or person, the better your options will be in the future.  If someone sees you strolling down the street with a handsome guy or beautiful woman, they will be far more likely to stop and notice.  Similarly, if a recruiter or hiring manager notices a resume from a candidate working at a Fortune 100 company, they are more likely to review it.  Your past can and probably will dictate your future.

The following provides guidance on navigating the application, interview, and negotiation stages.  It also highlights hazards to look out for along the way.  Happy hunting (or applying)!

Hi, all! I just found this sub, and it couldn’t have come at a better time!

I graduated with my associates in liberal arts this May, and then I started at a private four-year school after summer break. This school was a terrible fit, had terrible professors, no one cared whether you succeeded or failed, and they straight out lied to me about the strength of their writing program. I felt like I was drowning, and my mental health really started to deteriorate because of it. So, a little over a month ago, I dropped out.

I decided to take some time off to find what path I’m supposed to be on and who TF I even am (because I have never had a clear feel for either), and I am having an incredibly hard time figuring it out. But, here is a list of what I know about me so far:

• I love reading, writing, editing, and researching about anything and everything I find interesting  
 • I am obsessed with history, folklore, and mythology  
 • I love meeting new people, experiencing different cultures, talking to people about what they believe (politically, socially, religiously, etc.) and why they believe it, I love seeing how we can all look at the same thing, event, or topic and all come away with different takeaways  
 • I want to travel the world and see everything, I want to try all the food, see all the art, stand in all the ruins, and drink in all the history and beauty  
 • I love learning and trying new things  
 • I really like the idea of a nomadic lifestyle, having an RV or trailer, not being rooted to anything. Being able to just move at the drop of a hat, to go where I want whenever I want sounds wonderfully freeing  
 • I want flexibility in my schedule (I don’t want to be worked to death, I want to have a life outside of work too)  
 • I don’t want my job to dictate how I live my life outside of work (E.G. nurses can’t paint their nails, have visible tattoos, excessive piercings, etc.)  
 • I’m 100% an introvert, so I need time alone, but I also need something to force me to not lock myself in my apartment 24/7 • I absolutely suck at math (it’s quite sad honestly)

If anyone can give me advice, I would be unendingly grateful!!! I have no idea where to start, I have no idea what jobs encapsulate all these passions, I don’t know what education I need to bring all these loves together, I don’t know what job fields are flooded! I am so lost right now, it’s starting to feel like I’m never going to figure out where I am and where I’m supposed to end up!

TL;DR: I am lost and looking for advice on how to find my career path (and the route I need to take there, I.E. do I need a degree, what level degree would be needed, internships, etc.). I have a million interests that include writing, editing, travel, history, nomadic RV/van living, etc. And I know a few things I don’t want, like never having any real time off, and not being able to have tattoos or piercings.",How do I decide on what to major in and what career to pursue with my specific talents and interests?,1

But I kinda regret withdrawing and LOVE the study of health, from public health to pathophysiology and pharmacology.

Other careers I’ve explored include IT, school counseling, masters in public health. My heart though lies in healthcare, but I don’t like hands-on skills that is so necessary in fields such as PT, OT, Respiratory therapist, etc.

"**TL; DR: Copywriting isn't working out. I have two options: computer science (don't have a specific direction, feel a bit more comfortable doing it, worried the market's becoming too saturated to make it worth it) or physical therapy associates (this degree will keep me in Florida, which I hate, for the next four years).**   


Alright, long story that I'm going to try and condense because I don't have a lot of time to sit and write it all out.  


I'm a copywriter from South Africa who's lived in America for about 2 years. I've been in the industry for the last ten years, but since moving to the states, I've had more trouble than ever in my life just finding a job. I finally got one with an agency in Daytona but they're super sketchy and, for the last year and a half, I've been trying to get out. But, as someone still pretty new to the country and having my own REALLY intense schedule, networking and finding a job on anything other than job boards has been difficult. It's part of what makes me hate Florida so much right now.  


And, to be honest, I've started to feel pretty disillusioned with marketing. I feel like I've got tons of experience and a lot to offer and nothing's working. So, a couple of weeks ago, I started taking basics of HTML at a community college, and had plans to do the full computer studies course, which is two years and sets me up with, like, an A+ certificate, Java, C++ and a Ruby elective. So far the web stuff is going straight As, which I know doesn't mean much because it's easy. I don't necessarily know which direction I want to take it in, but I have tangential experience with it, and it's not a field that requires me to constantly market myself to everyone in order to get ANYthing (at least, not so much as marketing).   


But I am concerned that more people are getting into this every year, and I'm already hearing stories of people saying things like ""I've got my CS masters and I can't find a job)"". Once again, it's not as bad as copywriting, but I don't want to get into it and just be in the same place again within a few years. I want to go to school for as little time as possible and start working in an industry or field that will always have a space for me.  


On the other hand, my wife's been in a medical program for some time, now. I don't have the time to go through her whole nursing course, but we looked at physical therapy and it's a two year associates with a license at the end that will set me up for a great salary and lots of job opportunities, moving forward. But, because I work during the day, there's a great chance I won't have enough time to get all of the prereqs done before registration next year, which may mean us living in Florida for the next four years, total And we REALLY don't want that.

My order of priorities goes like this:

1. Make computer studies work (but is the market going to be anywhere near as reliable as if I went into medicine?)
2. Somehow make physical therapy work (but living in Florida until I'm 36 hurts)

I'd love to hear your opinions. There are some subtleties I left out because this is already so long, but clearly I'm confused and I just need some help. I wish copywriting could have worked, but I've been ice skating uphill since 2017 and I'm tired.",Need To Pick A Career Path. Can Anybody Give Me Some Advice?,1

"Hello Everyone,

I hope this is the right place to post this. I'm looking for career advice so I suppose it is. I know many of you have probably felt the same way so I hope someone who was in a similar situation can offer some guidance. Here goes:

I'm 32, married, have a 2 year old son. Bought a new home a few years ago and have roughly $15k student debt, along with my mortgage. I have a bachelors degree in Economics from a major university with a minor in business. I also have roughly 2 years of classes towards a computer science degree (I'm including this because it's relevant to what I need advice on). 

After college I got a job as a Data Analyst, which I did for around 2 years and then the company was bought by another company and everyone was let go. I really enjoyed that job. I thought it would be my career and I would just slowly work my way up the ranks. I was young and naive, and got a brutal awakening to how the real world works sometimes. Since then I have been at a few different jobs. Currently I am working for a small transportation company (4 years) in which I wear many hats. I am basically the HR department, help with accounting/tax stuff, billing, and IT. I also help out with the actual transportation side of things if need be. For example, if the guy who does dispatch is sick or on vacation. The job is fine, and I make enough money to be able to allow my wife to stay home with my son, we recently bought a new home and vehicle so I can't really complain. The problem is that I feel very complacent, like i'm just wasting my time and skills. I come to work and go on auto-pilot. I definitely don't feel like I fit in at the company or in the industry either. It's a very crude environment and I have to deal with some of the most extreme personalities on a day to day basis. I'm not the most professional guy in the world, but there is basically zero professionalism across the board. It's like a high school locker room environment and i'm a freshman. I have to deal with harassment from employees, my boss, and even just people I have to talk to on the phone. Mainly because I don't know anything much about trucks or the transportation industry, and because I ""dress fancy and went to a fancy university"", (I will wear slacks and a button up most days). They all say I don't do anything, because I don't do physical labor or I don't drive a truck. They think computers are only for messing around. They always say I think i'm better than them, which isn't true at all. I have always believed you treat everyone the same, which I try to do. Also, because it's the transportation industry and I'm salaried I work a lot of hours including weekends and some evenings. I am basically on call 24/7.  I feel like i'm missing out on valuable time with my son/wife, and I don't feel appreciated at all. Now, I know that's basically the case for almost all jobs and for anyone who has a job. You are just going to miss out on time with family if you have to work, and i'm sure almost everyone feels unappreciated at their job, so maybe i'm just feeling sorry for myself. 

**Here's the main thing though**. My heart keeps drawing me to the tech industry. I really enjoy tech related jobs/tasks (IT, Data Analysis, Web development). I find them fun and interesting and often find myself spending my free time building pc's, doing basic programming, making websites or maintaining them (I created a website for the company I work for now, I also run a site for the local golf course). I keep finding myself applying for jobs in those fields, and I never get the job because I don't have any real experience or education. I would really like to break into the IT world, and I feel like when I read the bullet points on a job description for what the job requires that I can do most if not all of them, but I have no way to prove that to the employer other than my word. I have experience with Java, SQL, Linux, HTML, CSS, i'm very proficient with both the Windows and MAC operating systems. I have basic networking knowledge, I manage our local network at my company currently. I have built two computers, multiple websites, I have experience with remote desktop/remote services. I guess I don't need to go on too much about this part, because again it's just me saying I have this experience. I mainly just feel like if I were able to get a job in this industry that I could a) possibly make more money b) look forward to going to work everyday and maybe enjoy it c) be around people who are less toxic, or similar to me. 

My questions are these: Should I attempt to take some classes to get a degree? Or are there classes I can take online and self teach myself? Should I try to get some certifications online? If so, what would you recommend? Do you think I have a pretty good gig and should probably just stop whining? I'm terrified to take a big risk and fail and ruin what I currently have.

"I’ve been let go before but I usually see it coming. I realize I’m maybe way over my head. I realize that maybe because I don’t enjoy the job I prob come off that way and put zero effort. There are times I see it coming because I admit I’m doing a shit job or honestly I realize the job is too much for me.


But this one I was excelling at. I loved it. It was a perfect fit for me. I was loving it so much I didn’t mind working overtime all the time. I only had a week to train for a job that takes two months to train for. It was a lot, but I rolled with it. Were there stumbles? Yes. But I am only 3 weeks in!! For a job I had 5 days of training for! That is a very in-depth manager position of an entire facility. I was doing good, and I feel like any normal boss would have noticed and appreciated it. Even my co workers and the person I replaced agreed. One of them called me a good luck charm in terms of business. The person I replaced said she was shocked. My ex boss is anal retentive and the first time we worked together for me personally was a nightmare. She seems like the type of person who judges too quickly, if you don’t pick up on something in two seconds you’re stupid, and no matter how good you do it will never be enough which makes me feel poorly because the two other people who work there do just fine with her. So obviously I’m just incredibly incompetent or something. Who knew...

I made two mistakes in front of her that honestly weren’t huge and it was legit my first week on the job. The few other mistakes I made were actually in front of the owners husband, and he isn’t even my boss and doesn’t do any hiring or firing and literally is the supply guy for the building. And handles building maintenance sometimes. And the mistakes were minimal. I could tell he was frustrated but I didn’t think it would cost me my job. Still don’t know if it did. I literally left some lights and a fan on one week into my position. And didn’t hear a toilet running when I was shutting down this huge facility and he got on to me about it. I also accidentally locked myself in a room (just went out the side door and walked back around front. That’s it.) but he made a big deal about it.


Today she sees me working my ass off after another week of kicking ass, comes into my office and says “I appreciate all you’ve done for us the past few weeks. I love your passion and creativity. You’re such a good person. Unfortunately it’s just not a good fit. I need someone with more experience.”

I’m in shock. And I sort of try ask for more clarity because even she told me I was walking into a landmine only having 5 days of training that usually requires ***2 months***

I asked if she thought had I had more training and More time to grow if she saw me getting where she apparently needs me to be “right now” and she said I have potential but no. Even though I pulled off everything she asked of me for 3 weeks either well, very well or at minimum “fair but needs improvement” because of lack of training.

I almost feel like maybe a coworker who she’s known for years said she didn’t like me. Her husband was visibly annoyed with me last time I saw him because of the little hiccups. He saw me working my ass off though as usual. 

I feel blindsided because I truly felt I was doing a good job.

I’m so depressed:( I feel like nothing I do is ever good enough. I’m not a genius and no I don’t pick up things like in a second, like some people are just experts and pick up new things very quickly. I’ve never been that person. Doesn’t mean I’m not intelligent. If I had another two weeks or even one I’m sure I would have been even better than I was this week. I was improving every week no doubt. 

She seemed MAD when firing me. But didn’t give any specifics on what the hell I managed to mess up so badly on that she had to FIRE ME and not have a meeting about it? The fact that she seemed angry made me believe there was more to what she gave me and it’s bothering me a lot. She said she really liked me as a person too so I’m overall confused. And sad. And feeling really low.

"January 2nd I will have been at my company for two years. I started out as a Junior Systems Administrator. I was grateful for the position, because in my area these stepping stone positions are hard to come by in the IT field. They actually made the position for me when I interviewed for a Systems Administrator position with not enough experience. They liked me and offered me the Junior position so I could work my way up. I was replacing one admin, we'll call him Ross. They guy who was training me left a couple months after I started, we'll call him Kyle. After a few more months we hired a guy as a Senior Systems Engineer, Brian, with about 20 years experience.  
A little over a year into the job, I got promoted. My reviews were excellent and even said I was doing more and better work than Ross or Kyle. But the raise was basically just an early yearly raise. Because we go to the same gym, I talked to Kyle, and he started out making more than what I was now given, and he made less than Ross. I went to my supervisor and even up to the director, and they don't think it's fair, but HR has put their foot down saying I'm right in the middle of the pay range for my position and that's the most they can justify.  


Skip forward another few months to a couple days ago. I've been feeling like the Senior Sys Engineer, Brian, hasn't been doing much work. His projects sit there. I've even taken over and completed some of them, and he doesn't do much of the daily tasks. My supervisor talks to me privately to say that he has noticed the work I've been doing and that Brian hasn't been pulling his weight and I've been doing more and better work than him. He was able to get me a couple thousand $ more by moving me into the next company bonus tier. He said that the pay difference is very unfair, but that's the most he can do right now without HR getting in the way.  


I know the pay ranges for my department. If Brian is in the middle of his range, his base salary is about $15k more than my salary plus max bonus. I feel like I'm getting screwed by HR. Am I wrong?",Am I being cheated by HR?,1

"I'm starting my career as a real estate agent and have been meeting with different brokers and checking out brokerages around the city where I live. I'm having a really hard time choosing a brokerage, and along the way I had an odd interview experience. Here are descriptions of the options I have so far:

&amp;#x200B;

1. First brokerage is a speciality, small, independent brokerage. The man who owns it is in his late 60's and he mostly does real estate investing and that's his niche but he also sells and rents here and there. He has two other guys working for him, one young agent around my age (23/24) and another who's about 45. I met them both and they were delightful, very friendly people. I live in the neighborhood where the company is located. The broker is a genuinely good guy, pure of the soul - he's one of those people who could easily and effortlessly get along with anyone. I felt really comfortable around him. They have a lot of rentals and sales on the market.

* Pros: Super friendly broker and agents, small brokerage, 70/30 split, printing, business cards, everything provided, no desk fees or any other fees besides MLS and other necessary memberships. He has a wealth of knowledge, knows everything about finances and real estate investing (which I want to get into in a few years), is going to mentor me, great reviews online, literally a 2 minute walk from my apartment. Prices for rent for them range from $2,000 to $4,000 and for sales it's $500,000-$2.5M. He guaranteed new agents who work for him make $50,000-$100,000 on average their first year. He was honest and said it may take a while, sometimes months (though unusual) for an agent to start earning money, but once the first client rolls in, it's a snowball effect going forward. He has numerous connections with people all over the city, and I met two of his investor friends who own a majority of properties in our neighborhood. There are leads but I'm responsible for marketing. He gave me really valuable advice on networking as well. We bonded over Barbara Corcoran and women in the real estate business, books and art, we spent nearly 4 hours talking. I could help him elevate his business with social media and changing up the outside of property, etc. I could see myself making a good name here and still earning a decent income without much internal competition, actually building relationships with people in the neighborhood I live in, and having a balanced work and personal life. The office is on the semi-casual side which I like, too.
* Cons: Although the broker is a genuinely good guy, he talks a mile a minute and I noticed he doesn't stay on topic for long. He talks *a lot.* I would ask a simple question and it would take forever, sometimes never, to get a detailed answer. Training is completely independent. There are no classes, nothing. It's all on your own. I would be able to shadow him for a while, he'll teach me how to write an offer and so forth. His real estate group has several subscriptions so he said it's mostly reading. I would need to work from my own computer which isn't a problem for me but did strike me as a little negative. The office is super small, two desks and one Apple desktop, though the space is clean, warm, inviting, and in an amazing location - I saw probably 50 people walk by and peek inside while we were talking. What struck me as a huge red flag was when he was describing a story to me and said how a seller told him someone at a big name company said the homes price was worth $580,000 and another agent from another company said $590,000 but he suggested $610,000. The seller wanted $605,000 and the property got an offer for $607,000. He said he accepted the offer right away before telling the seller (yikes) but the seller was thrilled. I don't know if this shows his expertise or lack of knowledge when it comes to pricing properly. Another red flag was he said you're not supposed do this, but he does anyways, which is when an owner says they only want females or males in the apartment, you only choose that requested sex to rent. I think it's because he's old so he doesn't care but that stood out to me as a negative. The agents who work there have also only been there for one year. He told me that's because it's such a small company that he only keeps it around to help out family, people he knows, etc when they're in real estate - he's never hired someone he didn't know before. He said he would hire me because I was the only person to ever cold call and that impressed him.
* Another bonus con: This is isn't a luxury brokerage, which is the industry of real estate I initially wanted to go into (now I'm more open minded about it; the neighborhood I live in is one of the most expensive in our state, and right now it's a picky buyers market so selling has become challenging even in the luxury world).

&amp;#x200B;

2. Second brokerage is an international luxury brokerage. There are five currently in my state and they're opening up another location next year. Extremely formal, serious work environment. Definitely feels corporate the second you walk in. They're selling a lifestyle, not just a home.

* There are around 70 agents, 12 of those are teams. The owners of this location are one of the teams. I had a great interview with one of the agents earlier this week. She was so sweet and we talked for about an hour until the wife, one of the owners, came in.
* I hate to sound like a millennial but here I go - you know when you can just tell that a ""vibe"" is off with someone? I got that right away with the owner. She was cold towards me, saw me in the morning when I walked in to meet the agent but didn't say a word. In the middle of my interview with the agent she walked in and shook my hand. She sat down and asked me right away where I worked before and if I had six months of expenses saved. I told her I met with several agents before getting my license and they all advised me to make sure I had six months saved, so yes, and told her my work experience. She replied, ""We don't sell homes, we sell a lifestyle. Clients can smell desperation."" This came out sounding very passive aggressive. She said she sold over $30 million this past year and asked me what I want out of real estate. I said I was looking to build a reputable, serious, life-long career in an industry where there's constant opportunity for growth. I didn't experience that in my first job and knew I wanted more out of life than that. She made a comment about how I look 16 (I'm 23, petite/athletic build). I noticed there's no diversity at this office, everyone is white, which there's nothing wrong with that but I grew up in an extremely diverse town and went to school where 60% of the student population was international. I'm Latin American, so I was drawn to this company because of their international base but their agents don't reflect that. She asked me how old I was and then automatically said, ""Oh, I'm not supposed to ask that -"" and I said, ""No worries, I'm 23."" She said, ""Yeah, I often say and do things I'm not supposed to."" She said real estate is a tough business, etc, and said, ""It's not about looking good and wearing high heeled shoes."" I felt like this was condescending because I put in the effort to look nice and professional for this interview and I was wearing block-heel styled shoes, less than three inches in height lol.
* She asked me some other things but I said flat out that I'm looking for a strong training program and that I want to shadow a top producer. She said their company doesn't offer shadowing and the company doesn't hire new agents, but it just so happens that a woman on her team is pregnant and is going to leave in January. She said she would talk to her team but asked if I wanted to step in and be an extra set of hands. I would go to showings, listings, see how an offer is made, etc, basically shadow her, her husband, and another team member while the other team member is out. There's only one other team member who's ever shadowed like this before, and it was actually the woman who's currently pregnant. She was in the office and was the first person I met when I walked in the agency. She came into the room and she was really sweet, but I could tell the owner was nice and friendly with the two women but with me she was hard-edged. She said I would be paid for the few months of work while that pregnant woman was out but that there's no guarantee I would end up on a team. She added, however, that lots of people would love me and would probably fight to have me on their team. In my head I was confused and felt slightly gaslighted given her snide comments earlier and demeanor. She said she and no one on her team would ask me to do something they wouldn't do themselves while shadowing. This includes making the beds, planting flowers in the front yard, doing anything that needs to be done basically. She said everyone works A LOT, I should expect 10-15 hour days Monday through Sunday and be available any time after work from mid-December to late March. She also asked me what neighborhood I live in, if I live alone, if I pay rent or own my own place. I thought those were inappropriate questions but answered politely.
* Right after this owner walked out the agent who originally interviewed me asked to see me again tomorrow so I could meet the other owner. I agreed and showed up. This time it was just him and the original agent. This man told me they would pay me $1,000 per month (that's way less than minimum wage in my state) for those months I would shadow. I told him his wife the day prior told me there would be no guarantee to join a team afterwards and I didn't want to waste their time or mine, so if that was the offer I wasn't taking it. He said his wife was impressed by me and thinks I would be a good fit. He said he would let me shadow him, he would personally train me, he would create a business plan with me, and I would be guaranteed to join a team after the few months are up. I said I would think about it and give him a final answer next week.
* Pros: Luxury international brand, reputable and respectable brand, thousands and thousands of listings in the city and beyond, opportunity to make a really high income, will get paid to shadow and there's in-house training with the top producers twice a week, their rentals are $10,000+ and sales begin at $800,000 with the average being in the $5-15M range. This brokerage has all positive reviews.
* Cons: I don't know the commission splits because the conversations moved quickly and the agent I was interviewing with had to leave early both times to teach a training session. I don't know what they'll cover, although I do know headshots, business cards, pamphlets, etc are provided. I felt extremely uncomfortable with the way the owner treated me. If she makes my life a living hell and smears my name and potential reputation as an agent, it doesn't matter that I'm in the company already, no one will add me to their team since she's the one who calls the shots/has the most influence. The offer she gave me and her husband gave me are completely different. To be honest I felt insulted by the $1,000 per month when this company ranks in multi-millions a year.
* Bonus con: Every single person who works at this place was already wealthy before they joined. They don't need this job, none of them used it as a stepping stone in their life to shift from one class to another. They could sell one home a year and it wouldn't matter. There's only one young person in the entire office who's 25. This company never takes new agents and they only hire internally people who have experience. They said they hired her because ""she's different"" - she purchased a home from them when she was 21. I'm genuinely concerned that if hired these people are going to treat me like a charity case and use me to the point it's going to essentially force me out of the business from how miserable the experience will be. They know I don't come from high society/wealth hence the first questions this owner asked me: where I was raised, where my parents were raised, where I live now, if I have roommates or not, if I rent or own property(-ies). I left both meetings feeling down and less than, disrespected and looked at as an idiot who's desperate for anything and would be grateful to just sit at an open house with a measly (to them) $5M price tag. My instincts usually never fail me. In my first career I met with a friendly woman from the company but I could just tell something was off. Once I started working I met the boss above her and I got the exact same feeling with this owner that I had with my previous boss (toxic, passive aggressive, gaslighter, insecure/wants to make young people's lives miserable, etc). There's a difference between being a luxury company owner and seeing a young person full of ambition, and saying, ""I'm so sorry but we don't hire outside of the company. I appreciate your time, take care"" or admiring a young person trying to improve their life and working hard, and welcoming them onto the team. But to go out of your way to make rude/diminishing comments to someone just starting out and then dangle a carrot in front of them? Something is not right there.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Third brokerage is known very well within the country. About 30 agents at this location, the only one in our city. Super clean and open office, mostly young people. I met with the CEO and he was just... neutral. Answered some questions I had but didn't engage much in conversation. He said there's web training online but you learn by going out into the field. He said you learn from other agents. If you want to shadow, you have to ask one of them to take you out. This struck me as so off-putting because if these same people are your competition, that's never going to happen. They're always going to be too busy and they likely actually are. He seemed very nonchalant/didn't care - it's every man for himself at this place basically.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to meet a few more companies in the next week but so far the first option seems like the best fit for me. My biggest concern is getting business and I can forget about the luxury market if I start there. Maybe I'm wrong about that though, I've never worked in the real estate business before.

"Hey everyone. Is there such a thing as an 'agent' for normal jobs? For example, if you're a good repairman, or a good coder, or cook or martial arts teacher or whatever. Is there someone who can line up opportunities for you, the same way a Hollywood talent agent could line up opportunities for an actor? I don't mean someone finding a 9-5 job per se, because that would likely just be a recruiter; recruiters tend to represent companies, not 'talent' or potential employees. I mean more like someone marketing you and your skill set in pursuit of a variety of opportunities that suit your strengths specifically. 

To illustrate, lets say I am a great designer and I want to teach a class in it. But I am terrible at pitching. Is there a 'representative' who could contact local schools or community centers to pitch it on my behalf? Or someone who could negotiate salaries on a secretary's behalf?  Or someone who could find opportunities for a someone looking to branch out? I imagine there must be something like this, but I am blanking.

"Fifty years old. Changed careers at 40 with the goal of career and income growth. Went into debt to finish my Bachelors in 2011. Income retreated below pre-career change levels while expenses grew (family expansion/transition to single income household). Recent promotion and income growth, but not to what I expected 10 years ago when I made this move.

Still in an industry I happened into 25 years ago. Bored and uninspired in this industry. 

The main bright spot of it all is that I have built pretty robust technical skills for innovating and automating through software and development. It started about 6 years ago when I discovered how to make Excel do the heavy lifting using VBA. I’m not talking about recording macros. I’m talking writing code using common programming concepts.

This birthed a passion in me to learn web development and web app development (think CRUD - Example: order entry system with user authentication). I also use Python to work with Excel files and data.

Clearly, I’m interested more in solving technical and business challenges through technology more that the day to day operations of a given business or my own boring industry.

I will say, as a manager of a team, I enjoy coaching people - which typically revolves around how to think about and analyze data, and innovation. I also enjoy building strategic relationships because that has a twofold sense of accomplishment for me: I can provide value to others and I feel like it’s always and opportunity to learn something new about and from others.

I can program database apps using both MySQL or MongoDB with the Node/Express stack, but I don’t get the chance to do it everyday. I have been doing this when I’ve had time for 2-3 years now.

I’ve also freelanced in the side for businesses providing solutions in Excel and Access. I love doing that but the downside is it’s an evening/weekend gig when I do have clients and it doesn’t scale.

This is where I ask for feedback hoping this resonates with someone who has discovered how to successfully break out of a pigeon hole or rut.

"I am 25 years old, from the South Asian country Bangladesh. I graduated with a Bachelors in Business Administration degree last year from one of the better schools of our country. I have a decent GPA and good extracurricular activities. I also engaged in voluntary work during my time at university. I have no work experience except my three month internship at the end of last year and a remote content writing job since July, 2019. I never had a stable 9 to 5 job.

Hey guys I need some help with a problem.

I feel so bad about how I’ve behaved ever since I left high school. I finished in 2015. I was the fucking star student, frequently number one. But I joked with my life and education after high school. This was partly because I was fixed on my dream of one day playing pro basketball. I was not even thinking about going to university like everyone else. The only thing I was thinking of was playing basketball and how I could join the NBA one day. 

With the work I was putting in (or not putting in) and at my age, I wonder how I possibly thought I could get there. I mean, I had zero structure or discipline. I was playing FIFA with my cousin till 2 am and waking up at noon. I hardly had any structure to my training: going to the gym irregularly without any goal, playing pick up at a local court (and thinking this was enough training). 

In high school, I only thought of two possible careers: Medicine or pro basketball. Naturally, I applied for the former. I got accepted and was to join in 2016. However, I was not so excited about this. My mind was still on basketball. I felt I could still make it to the NBA if I just tried harder. 

September 2016 came and I joined Med school. But reluctantly as I still wished to be playing basketball. All along my plan was: “Okay, I need to keep on training (the fake training I spoke of earlier with nowhere near the intensity or structure needed to even make a high school team in USA) so I can become good enough. Then I’ll do SAT’s, join a college abroad and join their basketball team.” It sounded great in my head, but the odds were infinitely stacked against me. Especially with no support (understandably) from my family, it would be very hard for my dream to come true.

So anyway, the short of it was I joked with Med school coz I did not really want to be there. I came late for classes, did not do my 1st sem exams and was generally withdrawn. I was just thinking; “I’m going to join the NBA so why am I wasting my time here. After 4 months I left, planning to continue training for basketball and working out. I did just that, but the pressure kept on mounting.

My parents kept on asking me what I wanted to do. I did not want to say, “All I really want to do is play basketball.” I felt like they would (as they previously had) not support that at all. I also did not want to be embarrassed if I failed. While I was still in medical school, my mother suggested that I apply to law school as it is “general”. So when asked that fateful question and feeling like I had actually messed up by playing with med school, I simply responded “ I want to do Law”. This would appease my parents, but I never really wanted to Law either.

Reluctantly, I applied to and got accepted into Law at Strathmore University. 

All the while I was thinking: “Man I shouldn’t be here!” I kinda felt forced to be there by my Dad (the day before I was to join he gave me a talk which basically ended in “You WILL go tomorrow”.) I figured: IF only I could make some money then I could be free to do whatever I please. I started looking for any and every way to make cash. That’s when I stumbled upon Forex trading and got obsessed. Long story short, it flopped. Around Dec 2018, a year and a half into my trading journey, I realized I would need to have more stability and not rely on trading to make a living. I quit

Now I am two years through my degree. My grades are average ( C ). I have missed the whole first sem of my third year because I seriously did not plan to come back after that 2nd year. I had planned to transfer to do Financial Engineering (this was because of my tango with Forex; I thought my interest in markets meant I should do a degree in Finance) but after attending 2 classes I felt like this was a mistake. 

There I was, the only 21-year-old in a class of 18 year old's (now that I write it down the age difference does not seem big at all). But I felt so bad and alone. I left and tried to go back to Law school. I had missed a week of the 1st semester and so I was rather lost. I was not attending classes seriously and that’s when I decided I needed a break. I applied for Academic Leave and it was approved. Now I feel like that was a big mistake. I feel like I should have just graduated with this degree and went on to study something else I liked at Master’s level or get a 2nd degree. 

Anyway, here I am now trying to get back into the 2nd sem and figure out how I can finish this degree. I am set to graduate in 2022 while my peers from high school graduate next year. 

Should I switch to another degree or try and see this one through. My main option is to drop this one right now and go to SA for my degree. I was thinking CS and Math, Electrical Eng or Business. Do you think it’s a good idea to go abroad for an undergrad? Should I just slog through and get this degree even if my grades are poor and I don’t really care for the Law?",Help!!!,1

"Hello everyone, I was recently chosen by my graduate university to participate in a job shadowing event at Google which is only supposed to last about 2 hours. I was told to bring 2 copies fo my resume, get business cards from managers and others at the event, and wear business attire.

A few questions I have regarding the overall event:

1. Does anyone have experience with a Job Shadow event at Google and if so, could you possibly provide a general outline of event?

2. What is the appropriate way to hand someone at Google a resume? What I mean is what would be a natural conversation to strike up in order to present my resume to a hiring manager?

3. I would not want to over dress but certainly would not want to give off a careless look. How would khakis, a plaid shirt, and brown boots look at a Job Shadowing event? Would it be too laid back? A surefire backup is professional business attire but again, I would not want to be over dressed for such an event.

4. Not my most important question but certainly one I am looking forward to the most, how many people have experienced a successful employment opportunity from a Job Shadowing event such as the one held by Google.

"A friend of mine recommended Insight Global (a recruiting agency) to me earlier this year after she was able to find a job at Salesforce through it. It's been a goal of mine to work at Salesforce for a long time, but I know it's difficult to get in there.

So, I connected with Insight Global and they brought a job opportunity to me recently. It's not with Salesforce, but another big company in my city and I'm interested. The pay is a lot more than I'm currently making (it would be a 20% raise). However, I'm really unsure about the contract-to-hire aspect. I currently have a job I like, I'm just looking for something more challenging with higher pay.

After doing some reading online, it looks like companies agree to a certain pay with Insight Global, then they keep a percentage of that pay and give the rest to the contract employee. It seems like they take a pretty big chunk of the pay, so now I'm realizing this company would actually be willing to pay someone in this role a lot more. Plus, with permanent hire status not guaranteed, I'm not sure I want to take this risk, even though it's seems like a good opportunity from the outside.

Has anyone worked with Insight Global or something similar? Is it worth it? The reviews online are mixed, and to be frank, I feel like I could find a job on my own and not have to split the income with anyone else.

"Hi all, I'm not part of this Subreddit but this is a question I've had for a while.

I've wanted to live in Europe for years now, but I know that's not something that's easy to accomplish. Here's a little bit of information about me:

* American
* 20 years old (21 in November)
* Junior at university working on a bachelor's degree in Geography with a minor in Tourism
* Was an exchange student in Oslo (Norway) and I worked at a hotel as well in Oslo for a few months; I lived in the country for almost 8 months and have several friends there

I just love Europe; my family has strong European heritage; I'm descended from several places in Western Europe (UK, Germany, France) and Eastern Europe (Croatia, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary) and I just love the European lifestyle. My question is, how can I manage to find a job in Europe to be able to live there? I do speak relatively good Norwegian (been learning it for years; took a class when I was an exchange student in Norway and English was not used at all) and that's my ultimate goal, but I think the UK would be best as there's no language barrier when it comes to that... Is it easiest to get a job at an international American company that has offices in Europe? Or should I just keep applying to British companies? I am aware that I'd need several years of experience to get there; I don't expect to just move to Europe once I graduate... It's going to take time. I know tourism is a huge industry and I'm always trying to stay positive, but it's always in the back of my mind that I'll never get to go to Europe as anybody other than just a simple tourist. I just can't see myself living in the US. I'm more of a socialist and prefer socialist societies (I lived in Norway; I didn't want to leave and the only reason I did was because my residency permit of 8 months ran out so it would've been illegal to stay any longer). Luckily I'm doing well with college as I know most European countries only give out working visas to skilled workers, but I've been thinking of doing a masters program but I wouldn't do it in the US as the prices are ridiculous. Does anybody have any advice about how I can go about hopefully moving to Europe? I'm not afraid of hard work if I know it will pay off in the end; I'm still learning Norwegian and I have consistent contact with my friends because I really want to live there... But I'm afraid I have to rely on luck for me to reach this goal... Anywhere in Europe is fine with me. I'm obsessed with the history and architecture... I could go on for hours about the castles of Germany and Switzerland, the Black Plague, the Vikings... I know what I want in life, just don't know how I can get there.

I holding this new position for 2 months now which I am evaluating should I change or how should I proceed further.

In addition to this my reporting manager does micro management and constantly over my shoulder. I found out that there is a new position opening up in my neighboring department and I would be perfect fit for it. I am sure that I am perfect fit because it is more senior technical management position whereas current position is more of a management position. My manager and myself both are in same role, but just that I report to my manager in reporting hierarchy. Is it right to talk about me being perfect fit for new position just joined in this company for 2 months. If I want to talk should I talk to new manager, or next two levels in hierarchy (i.e) Director &amp; VP. I am saying VP because the new role ended up being role up to VP from downward.

Also, meanwhile I am thinking should reach my previous employer to talk about joining back. I left them for pay and not compatible work culture.

"In short, I've been very unhappy with how the company I work for has been run over the last 6 months. It's a very small company (20 employees in the office and then a few more abroad too). 

I was criticised for a few things I thought were completely unfair but I remained professional and apologised despite me not thinking it was my fault. Deep down this really wound me up but I didn't complain. In hindsight I probably should've had more of a backbone and been a bit firmer and standing up for myself while still being professional.

Anyway I just had my yearly 'review'. I was annoyed at how this was conducted... I finish work at 5pm and just as I leave my boss wanted to have a word (which was the review).
1) I didn't know I was having this review. It wasn't scheduled or anything.
2) It could've been done during my working hours and at least given me some notice to prepare etc
3) The ""review"" lasted less than a minute. I was expecting this to be a little more formal and a chance for us to discuss my performance

Instead the review consisted of him saying ""there were a few mistakes you made which we spoke about before and therefore I'd like to offer you more money however I can't and am going to give you a 1.55% pay rise"". 

This isn't actually a pay rise because inflation is closer to 2% so when you factor in the country becoming more expensive, I've actually had a pay decrease. On top of that it failed to take note of my bonus.

I went home that evening very angry and sent my boss an email saying ""Hi, I'd like to discuss with you first thing tomorrow morning the review we had at the end of the day today"". 

The following day I was very stern and honest about how I wasn't happy with how the company has been ran and how I've been treated. I basically said you've not given me the foundations to show you my potential and I was also disgusted how the review wasn't a review. It lasted less than a minute, I didn't have a chance to discuss how I felt and that the salary was given to me without my chance to discuss if I think it was fair. I also said I typed up some notes of how I honesty felt things have gone. 

As an introvert who rarely shows his emotions or opens up honestly like that I think my boss was a bit taken back. His hands were shaking a bit! I saw red inside but remained calm and collected when being brutally honest.

Anyway I said I'd give him these notes once I've typed them up fully. I've written them now but I wanted to ask for feedback before I send it. When I wrote it, emotions were running high so it has the potential to get me sacked. 

In summary the things I was annoyed about were:
1) how the review was conducted
2) mistakes they felt I made which I disagreed with
3) how I was ignored by management after these mistakes. They wouldn't give me work etc so how can I prove myself when they'd blank me?
4) I was accused of not working closely with them but when im ignored by them how am I meant to work closely? 

The letter is quite long. I wrote it as bullet points but since I felt quite strongly I ended up turning them into long paragraphs with examples and the document became long.

I'd like the outcome to be:
- improve my relationship with management 
- a salary that's at least the same as what I was currently getting paid (if not more). Or at the very least to give my bonus back - you want me to prove myself yet taking away an external incentive. Having said that I am motivated internally when I feel valued/respected which I don't at the company.

Is this a terrible decision? Just feel like I'm at a crossroads and need time to breathe. I know I'm lucky to even be considering doing this.

Has anyone ever done something similar or have any advice for feeling this type of way?

"I recently got through to the screening phase of a hiring process after the recruitment team said they enjoyed my application and thought it could be a good match. I had to complete a writing task to do with reasons for policy as the position was for a trust and safety policy teammember. My application did not pass this step and I see now that I just had a bit of a wrong angle on the writing task, I decided to go for a holistic view of the company and talk about their mission, values and then compare it with policies of their competitors but I see now that they probably wanted me just to respond as someone on their team explaining the policy to a client. Anyway, despite the fact that I was informed of this decision only a few days ago the job has since been posted twice.

"So here's the story. I am a recent graduate (My degree program ended at the end of May 2019). After a long and difficult job Search, I finally landed a job as a Software Engineer. I started work at the the end  of July. Just a few days ago, I was told by upper management that my manager is not happy with my performance and there are also some other issues. They gave me 2 options: either they terminate me or I resign. I chose to resign. They said that I would get an experience letter and it would have no mention of my 'forced resignation'. Note that I was on my '3 month probation period' during this time and was not a confirmed employee yet.

Needless to say, I am devastated! I am back looking for Software related jobs now (as that is what I majored in in University). Do you guys think I should mention My work experience at this company (where I worked a whole 2 month) in my Resume or not? I mean it is technically experience but maybe they'll think that the fact that I spent just 2 months there is shady.

"I've (F/mid-30s) been working in this industry (B2B tech) for 6 years. At first it was all new and exciting - the cool offices, the perks, the flexibility. Now, 6 years and 2 companies in, I could not be more bored of it all. I do not find software exciting (a few of them are, but very few). The company talks/thinks of their product like it's going to change the world, like it's going to cure cancer...when in reality we all know we're just working to make our CEO richer. 

I'm really struggling to find the motivation to stay interested. I zone out in a lot of the meetings. I procrastinate and get things done at the last minute. I'm doing enough to keep my job, but not being proactive or going above and beyond at all - and it's already been noticed. I desperately want to leave, and either move to B2C tech (to see if that reignites a spark in me), or change careers altogether, but I don't even know where to begin. I love psychology and helping people (anything related to mental health, happiness, relationships), and could not care less about money, revenue and KPIs. 

The only issue is that at the moment I'm in a long distance relationship - and this company has a presence where my partner lives, so I can work from there 1-2 weeks per month, which is basically keeping our relationship alive until we work out a moving plan. Leaving right now would cause the relationship to suffer, which is one of the few things currently making me happy and keeping me from losing my mind.

Until I'm able to leave - what are some of the things I could try to do to regain my motivation? I hate that I've become a slacker, it's not who I am or want to be, and I want to start caring again, I just don't know how.

"I've made a complete arse of my career and seem to be still in this trajectory.  I started off in IT support, grew to hate it, then ended up working in accountancy for about 10 years.

"
I am posting here seeking some guidance about a situation I have at my work. Both of these jobs are at the same company but vastly different areas (IT vs Bid Coordinator). I have a mortgage, wife, and 4 kids from 5 y/o to newborn (october baby!). These are my caveats but insurance would remain since it is same company. Apologies for long post, but a TL:DR is at the bottom. Feel free to ask any additional questions, I tried to lay out as much information as possible.

I currently work in the IT department in the call center / service desk and have an associates in Network Support. I have been with this company for about 7 years. The Job is ok. The pay is ok/decent. I have been told that I would be progressing from level 2 to a level 3 analyst. During my review time it was told to me that it has more requirements placed on that position, specifically time. I qualify for it with the exception of time at the company. I also was told that I had needed to step up from my managers supervisor (VP) even though my manager has seen that I take on projects, lead projects, assist / lead team and basically get things done (Everything). She was just as confused but had no room to move with it.

Currently in my position and area (IT as whole), our VP decided that there was some restructuring going on, and I was (along with a few others) were asked to bring up % of time doing what tasks we were doing along with what administrative tasks that we are doing.

I was approached from a division personnel ( I work on the corporate side ) that there might be a job opening in there area. They stated to me that this position depending on how things worked out if I were to get it, could progress from a bid coordinator / paper pusher into an estimator and possibly more.. which is nothing of what I went to school for. I feel like I could be underqualified but I do love to learn, and figure things out (hence IT). I feel that since I was approached that I could fit this and do well in that field. 

I do not know the finer details of this other position, but I am seeking advice as to if I should pursue this opportunity or not? My fear is that it would impact my job today if I go for it and do not get the position, that it would prevent future growth with the company in the IT area. I am not actively trying to get out of IT, but its disheartening when I get told that I will not be getting a promotion even though my manager agrees I should be. I may get it this year, or I may not... yet to be determined.

Should I go for this other position or hang out and see how things pan out in current position.

TL:DR

Got another opportunity in company I work for, in an area I may not be qualified for but would have training. Concerned with impact of current position growth  should I not get it, and how it might affect my family and I going forward. Should I go for this other position?

"About 1 year and a half years ago, I applied to this company, right after graduating from university. I was excited about the role, and I actually turned down another job offer at another company for this one (I’m still kicking myself for this). When I got hired, they hired me as an Data Analyst, which is even stated in the contract. The first day I got here, my manager told me how they had just lost one of their administrator coordinator, and that I was going to do analysts stuff, but they also wanted me to also help with the coordinator stuff. Back then, I didn’t really understand the difference, and said “sure, I don’t mind helping out.” Before I knew it, I was completely taking over that role, and months go by. I didn’t do much with the role that I was first hired to do. I see other analyst actually working, and doing work I know I can do, but they aren’t giving me. I talked to them about this, and told them I wanted to do more Data Analyst work, and they said they understood and they would get me more involved. They did, so I decided to remain at this company, but only about 45% of the work I do is Analyst work. THEN, the secretary goes on a 2 month leave (or so they tell me) and they ask me (more like told me) to “help out” doing her work since the coordinator work related to her work. 2 months past, and she’s still not back, and now it’s been 5 months of me doing her work. Most of my time I do work that related with invoicing, checking hours, making sure contracts get renewed — essentially doing full time secretary work for this company. I want to quit and get a new job, but I’m nervous about putting in my resume that I worked as “Data Analyst” (what’s in the contract, and did about 45% of the time, less now with the secretary gone) when I didn’t do much of that role. I’m so utterly bored at work. I feel like I got lied about this role. The reason why I haven’t flat out quit is because I need the money, I have a huge school debt to pay off.

"Of course I knew that combine work and studying won’t be easy task, but I even can’t imagine that it would be so hard! So after a year I have several tips for you to make your life easier:

1. **Plan your day.** You should know exactly at what time and where you need to be. Prepare your projects in advance when you have some free time; when you know dates of your exams or tests you need to discuss your days off with worker as earlier as possible. Be sure this will help you to avoid unnecessary problems.

2.  **Don’t be afraid to ask for help**. You’re a student, you don’t have a lot of experience and skills. So you just waste your time when try to understand something by yourself, it’s much better to ask your colleagues to help. By the way, they can advise how to communicate in the right way with your boss.

3. **Forget about studying at work, and at work - about studying.**

   You shouldn’t be nervous about your work and try to conduct business negotiations in a 10-minute shift. It is not worth working out at work for learning problems. Everything has its place and its time.

I really hope that my tips will help you to find balance in your student life.

"**tldr; I'm putting my company newsletter on hiatus because I'm facing health issues, should I mention that my health is the reason for the hiatus in the farewell article?**

22F-I work for an engineering firm part-time in human resources. I also have a chronic illness that frequently causes me to need to work from home, or leave work to go to appointments.

I voluntarily work on our monthly company newsletter as an editor, I work with two other employees, but I'm the one who makes the layout for the newsletter on publisher and puts all of the articles in place, and I write at least one of the articles every month.

My health has recently been a huge issue, because I've started having seizures, and my vascular condition is causing me to be unable to even sit up out of bed sometimes. Because of this I've been out of work sick and unable to even do any work from home.

"I’m 23F (UK). BA degree, freelance as a magazine editor. Journalism full time is my goal. Working full time to earn money — live with parents and looking for local work. I drive but don’t want a long commute owing to other commitments (writing, volunteering, a journalism course). 

Have tonight been offered a job as an editorial assistant. Salary is lower than my previous job and the job is a half hour drive.  They are giving me details of whether can negotiate salary tomorrow.

Also been offered two interviews next week for marketing jobs at local companies, one significantly more lucrative. They can’t interview me any sooner.

27 years old
Male
Finished degree in exercise science. Unable to get into physiotherapy school due to marks ( My poor GPA was due to severe stress and other issues affecting me during the time. There were certain things out of my control).
Started in 2010 and finished in 2015.
Took a gap year in 2016
Been working full time since 2017 at a call center and into my third internal promotion and new position within the business. The pay is extremely poor however the knowledge is valuable ( Taxation). I stuck around to save money but I want to focus on building transferrable skills for the next 30-40 years.
I have been looking at other careers. Should I stay here and just gain the skills and then go somewhere else?
Should I give physiotherapy school another shot at a school with lower standards or go to school for another skill?

Whilst working my interest has leaned towards building and construction . I can say I like learnig about how things work. Whether its the detail, design and process of how a building is built or how the humam body develops and responds to certain disease , etc. You get the idea.

"M22 - Currently working in Pensions Sector. I didn’t go to Uni, joined the sector as a trainee and completed industry qualifications.

I’m working in the public sector just now - which means flexible working (home working for half my working week), guaranteed bonus of around 10%, no pressure/stress to hit targets at work.

My current salary is £27.5k (i.e. £30k ish including bonus). Spend less than 30% of my time on the phone to clients giving guidance and the remainder of my time is spent doing pension calculations.

A job has come up in my field in a private sector company (applications close tonight) and it’s offering up to £30k. No flexibility in working (straight 9-5, no homeworking) and there is a bonus scheme but it’s shaky (i.e. staff have publicly criticised receiving 0% in the media). This is literally a telephone-based role - like 100% of your time giving advice. I’m naturally a bit of an introvert so this makes me a little anxious but the prospects are much greater - way more scope for progression.

Where I’m working right now, there is no scope for progression (such a small team) and I couldn’t see my earnings reaching above £30k (excluding bonus) within the next 3-4 years even. There seems to be a public sector mentality where complacency is acceptable, but I have received recognition at work for exceeding expectations. 

I just worry about risking my current job (£27.5k, massive flexibility and a lot of my time at home in peace) for a potential pay cut and possibly more stressful (being on the phone all day) - but I’m sure the earnings/career prospects are better if I can get past that.

The alternative is waiting and applying next year (they seem to recruit every August/September) when I’m more confident, but that means maybe missing out on a year’s progression at the other company.

"I'm currently working as trainee in one of the leading semiconductor company.. into my 7th month now.

I have a masters degree but i'm currently struggling to finish my assigned job/deliverables to my stakeholders..

First 6 month was torture. There was minimal support given to me from the team due to multiple projects coming in. My mentor is non-existent. It was assigned to her to show me the ropes, but it never happened. I have to work in weekdays and weekends as a way of compensating the lack of support. This lack of support was highlighted to manager, and eventually team lead was notified. But nothing changed. Except the 20 pounds body weight i gained for trying to catch up with the team over a long period of time (i'm still helpless for most part of my work btw).

Not only did my effort not noticed, in one instance i was also ridiculed for not performing by one of the senior in the team in a closed room. He suggested me to find another company where my ethnics could thrive (with only him in a closed room ) after lengthily critisizing my mistakes and bad work methodology. I kept calm and thanked him for the criticism as I wasn't sure how to respond and left the room. I know I have room for improvement but I don't think ethnicity have anything to do with work.

Now i admit, i'm not the best talent out there. My cgpa in university is nowhere near awesome. But i always try to do my best. But nowadays even getting out of bed is damn hard. The thought of work depresses me. It makes everything worse when younger trainees from other teams already got promoted. I feel jealous because they got a lot of help from people around them.

I felt so useless. helpless. worthless constantly. Every day, every hour.
I'm feeling as if I am sabotaged and setup to fail by own team.

If i could do everything myself, i wouldn't have accepted to be a trainee in the first place and just applied a position to my credential.

How did I get hired into this position? Am i really a super lazy entitled piece of shit who cant do anything? Should I even put effort into my work anymore? Whats the point?

27 years old
Currently have a bachelor of exercise science and a graduate certificate on exercise science. Initial plan was to go into physiotherapy but my marks suffered at university due to depression/anxiety for 2.5 years. I finished my course but my GPA was bad and the damage was done.
Started in 2010. Finished in 2015. 
I decided to work abit to take time off studies and intention was to alwayd study. However, seeing how the workplace is like my views on study and work have changed dramatically. I view education as in investment and want to make the right investment when I decide go retrain.

I currently work at a call center which outsources to a government department. The pay is bad but I stayed to obtain experience.Have been here for 2 years and have been promoted and recently got a role in their workforce analytics department. I HATE being in an office all day. I just feel like my day cruises by me and I get nothing completed. Im considering learning what I can and getting the skills then jumping ship.

I enjoy results and crushing goals. Needleess to say , it also doesnt help that after studying I ended up where I am and cant help but sometimes feel like a failure. But I know I can and should do better.

It would mean a lot if someone could help me decide what I want to do in any way.

Reason why I want/don't want to go into:

Engineering: I love math and logical thinking, and I think I will enjoy engineering programs at university, but I'm not too sure about being an engineer. I don't know if I'm really a hands-on person, and it's not like I'll be the one solving math problems, either.

Medicine: I don't have much interest in biology and I feel like I'm not smart enough to enter med school. The only reason I'm considering medicine is because of job security and because I am a caring person who enjoys helping people. 

Business(especially finance): I know that finance requires math which is good however I don't have a passion for anything related to business itself. I dislike accounting.

"Hi all

I’m unsure if anybody works in recruitment, but I could do with some advice.

I am one of my company’s top performers - there is myself and one other who generate over £1mn in profit for the business, although the other individual was handed a rather large account and is not well-liked. I’ve had to do things the hard way :-) build new accounts, develop those relationships and convert them to buying customers for my company... which I have had great success with! I now manage the staffing for multiple engineering companies across the globe.

I am approaching 5 years at my employer and I am starting to get itchy feet... I don’t know if it’s because I am not in a leadership position or if it is just because I’m getting bored of my surroundings. I am due a promotion shortly (long overdue, I actually hit my criteria 3 months ago), but I am unsure of what I wish to get in to.  Part of me is frustrated that my employer does not suggest a path for me - they are wanting me to provide them with suggestions which tells me they don’t really know what they want.

I think I have become a victim of my own success... because I make very good money on commission each month, my company are taking their time to promote me.  It’s rather frustrating when I see others who do far less getting promoted before I am 😵. 

Can anybody advise me on what they would do in my situation? Should I go big on my salary demands? Should I be disillusioned and annoyed that others seem to be getting ahead whilst I’m still on my basic pay grade?

"At our work, we have a ""pool"" system where we have 3 managers and switch between for projects. The projects typically take 4-6 weeks. I have been here for nearly two years. Since I started, 7/12 have quit (and been replaced). As a result, I am now one of the ""veterans.""

The reason turnover has been so high is that 2 out of the 3 are really horrible managers. One of them is ""survivable"" but you have to follow a guide to survive him. I do this to the new hires, and its hit or miss whether people can stick with it. Basically, if you don't kiss his ass he makes you pay for it. If you do, you can get away with anything.

The other horrible manager was gone for a while (gave birth). This was my third time working with her and honestly, one of the reasons I  was able to survive this place was because she was gone for so long. She is a micromanager from hell.

On every project, on day one she makes you give detailed self due dates for tiny parts, and she tells you what to do first. She also has a conclusion of the project in mind, and it's so specific to her that its like a guessing game. When you send her drafts, she shoots them down at the first typo or slight mistake. She will send them back with a comment like, ""Did you even read this before sending it to me??""

This last project, I was really trying. I started, and told myself, ""ok she's the next one, be cool and just do what she says and don't argue."" But two days before the project, she emails our business partners on my behalf (a no no in my area, she is supposed to supervise whether I do the project, not do this for me) and basically spells out ""hey this guy working for me, I don't trust him to do it right so I am going to start this off.""

When I submitted work, she told me I was doing it all wrong. She wants the formatting in a very unique way to only her. When the project is done, she goes back and bolds random words (no one else does this!)

This time was the last straw. We had already agreed the project was done. We had the last meeting with our business partners, and I \*thought\* it was done. Then she gets upset because, yes I fucked up, I e mailed her the wrong draft as the final - its easy to get confused because I have like 10 drafts in my downloads because of all the revisions.  Yes, I fucked up. The fix was to send her the correct one, which was named similar. Oops right?

Nope, what do I get? I get a sudden e mail, ""clearly you have not reviewed your own work, I am assigning this project to myself."" Like, WTF? We had already sent the ""pre finalized"" version to the business partners.

So I sent a reply, ""I am sorry we do not work well together. Maybe we should not work together, no hard feelings. There is no reason to work with someone that you don't work well with.""

I got like a 3 paragraph response back that I deleted after reading the first sentence. Micromanagers always double down, always blame the worker. Micromanaging ALWAYS causes people to do less and to become demoralized.

What demoralized me early on was one of the first results I sent her, she commented, ""Did you really obtain these results?"" She implied that I didn't actually obtain them, that I somehow didn't do anything? I replied, yes, I did... and then the next day she tells me, ""I opened up the code and tried to see what we could improve on, but I could not get access to the data sets."" So, thats a way of basically saying, ""I didn't believe you did anything, so I wanted to check.""

Any one of these is ok, I don't mind a manager checking things. But its just that from day one she had no confidence in me at all, and it was apparent. I don't know what will happen to me, but she is very petty. We had three people quit in quick succession earlier this year, and I know she was hardcore trying to ""manage out"" two of them. Our turnover is so bad though they can't really fire me.",I stood up to a vindictive micromanager today,1
"So I left my job as a clinical specimen processor I was at for 4 and a half years at the end of July. I had 2 job interviews with this place for a medical receptionist job at a pediatrician's office and they both go well. I accepted the job offer. I realized I was taking a good pay cut but in favor of being closer to home and daytime hours as a parent, I accepted. After I started there, I learned not too long that the training was very inconsistent and disorganized. The office nurse complained about how things aren't run properly there. I apparently got some complaints from some parents about sounding unsure about some things (which I thought would be expected from a new person but perhaps not). The inconsistent answers I got from the manager and the receptionist who has been there for 10 years was quite frustrating. The doctors changing their minds about some things was also a source of frustration.

I tried to keep up with the workload and improve based on some feedback I got but by the time I made improvements it was too late. I realize there are some things I could've done better, and I realize that perhaps being a receptionist truly wasn't a good fit for me. I admit that maybe I should've talked about my autism to my new employer but was worried it would impact my ability to get hired. The manager did tell me she likes me a lot as a person and said ""you're brilliant, the technical skills are there, and you're a great person. I'm not sure if it's the workload that's too much or what it is but \[name of place\] just isn't a fit for you"". She did say that she's willing to make me a letter of recommendation but I'm not sure if I want to mention this job on my resume or Linkedin profile now.

I feel like I had too much going on in my life that may have contributed. I took a disability leave from my old job for a couple months related to depression. This happened after a domestic violence related incident back in March with my ex boyfriend. Because of said incident, I left my son's dad and went back to my parents' house. I was walking on thin ice with my old job because my manager was upset I was taking so many phone calls and such from police officers, detectives, my lawyer, etc. and was part of why I went on FMLA to begin with.

I guess what I want to know Reddit is, what should I do now? Do I leave this job off my resume? Did I jump into a job with very different job duties too soon given my circumstances? How do I explain this to future employers? Should I start mentioning my autism to employers from hereon out?

Good Morning,

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to make this sob story as short as possible:

&amp;#x200B;

2012

▪ I graduated from one of the top four universities (prestigious name) in Ontario,Canada with a business degree. 

▪ Heart set on becoming a CA (that was the professional accounting designation at the time) → very motivated, busted my ass for grades, have fairly good grades.

&amp;#x200B;

2013

&amp;#x200B;

Did a winter contract for a small CA firm, some light bookkeeping, but mostly personal tax returns 

&amp;#x200B;

▪ After the contract was over, got another contract at a bookkeeping firm→ doing mostly tax. 

&amp;#x200B;

▪ At both of these firms I wasn’t treated respectfully, which made me resent accounting, then one day I thought to myself f—k it! I love soccer and I am very “good” at it (varsity and team Ontario), let me go to Europe to play professional soccer (made this dumb decision on a whim, with most people telling me that this idea is stupid and that I should just play soccer recreationally whilst pursuingmy CA (Accounting career). 

▪ June → I took a flight to Heathrow.

&amp;#x200B;

2014- June 2016

&amp;#x200B;

▪ Had an awesome time playing soccer in Europe (not the major leagues, of course), until in mid June 2016 I had an ugly wake up call: I was not making much progress to playing in the big leagues, I was earning slightly more than a McDonalds employee, and all my friends back home where earning at least twice as much and all had their accounting designations (CA, CMA, CGA at the time) 

▪ Spent the last bit of 2016 figuring out what I was going to do with my life→ at the time I thought insurance would be easy money with little academic requirement.

&amp;#x200B;

2017

&amp;#x200B;

▪ Spent the winter working on contract, at an insurance brokerage→ realized that I knew nothing about insurance, and most importantly; I hated how boring the work was (yes, I found it significantly more boring than accounting, which I don’t really find boring) ▪ Summer/Fall: Worked in a junior accounting role in an auto parts company (on contract). My contract wasn’t renewed.

2018

▪ Not a productive year: spent it mostly on studying for courses to upgrade for the new CPA program. I took a whole year to finish just two courses→ I just wasn’t as motivated/focussed as I was in my last year of university.

▪ Another reason was there were also some personal tragedies which occurred which took up a lot of time. 

**Now**

&amp;#x200B;

Have a small tax business, not earning much (intending to apply for work)

▪ Very unmotivated to do the CPA 

**▪ Very bitter and angry at myself for making such an incredibly stupid decision back in 2013 ( I see it as the biggest mistake in my life)**

**▪ Most people are telling me that since I am in late thirties (yes started very late in life I know L → I should just stick it out in accounting→ far too late to be switching careers.** 

 ▪ My one friend recommended I should start a painting business since its ‘easy money’, or to become a mechanic (he believes I’m not cut out to become an accountant). However, most of my friends recommend the previous bullet point. I have no experience in painting.

▪ If you gave me a time machine and let me go back to my mid twenties → I would of became a plumber or lawyer. 

**▪ My current goals are to purchase a house, and eventually earn at least 90-100k a year.** 

▪ Currently am single with no children. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1) Should I pursue accounting? (Or start a painting business?)

2) Should I do my CPA/ACCA in the states/UK? 

3) Where in accounting should I work? 

4) What would you do if you were in my position?

"So... I really need some help/advice...anything.

I am 23 and have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. I have been a nurse for two years now and developed panic disorder and chronic migraines. I do not know if nursing exacerbated the panic disorder and chronic migraines or not. The long shifts and intense interactions with patients really drain me though. I find myself needing to call in sick for nausea, vomiting, migraines, and panic attacks. 

I eat healthy. I exercise. I have good friends and family. I pray. I meditate. I go to counseling. I take medication. I got extremely good grades all my life. I am an ""achiever."" 

Should I stay in nursing? Should I try a different area of nursing? I would like to try a different area but I want a job that is intellectually stimulating. I worry that I hop between jobs too much because I get bored and depressed when I stay at a nursing job. I want to try different industries...but I also think I do like nursing deep down. When I think about anything I could do I want to be an entrepreneur or be a nurse practitioner in a rural clinic, while rock climbing and skiing in all my time off. When I think about this too much...I feel like I will not like any job and I am destined to a work life of misery. 

What should I do? Where should I go from here? I am a capable person...I am just devoid on energy, passion, joy, hope, and everything right now (this has been going on in cycles for the last couple years...I don't think it's temporary).

"Hi reddit, i wanted to seek advice regarding what kind of career i should look into. Long story short, i quit my 55k a year job due to anxiety about 6 months ago.

"A month ago I withdrew my candidacy from a job I was interviewing for. The job appeared pretty good, it would have been about $15k more and the environment seemed fun. Though I didn't really get a good idea of what the day to day was going to be like. The interview process was drawn out. 2 phone interviews. A code challenge. 2 hr in person interview and a final vid conference interview. I withdrew before the final vid interview.

Part of the reason I withdrew is that I am not unhappy with my job and I am still learning.
I cited company loyalty as one of the main reasons I was staying. After I sent the email, I felt I made a mistake. I've regretted it ever since. Now I am unhappy with my job. Nothing has really changed in my current role for me to feel so bad. I'm wondering how much of my regret is FOMO. I also think most of the reason I pulled put was fear of failing at the new job.

Anyhow. The job is still posted. They're hiring for a few positions. A recruiter even contacted me last week about it. Which tells me they might be having trouble filling the spots.

"TLDR at end.

I have an second ""interview"" tomorrow for a career path I am very excited for after my current ""dream job"" decided to suck the soul out of me. I put interview in quotes because I will be doing a 10 - 15 minute presentation on a health promotion program plan I created after I learned I had a second interview - their second interview prompt was to create a health program. Then they will ask me questions about the program, and they explicitly state several times that there will be room at the end for my own questions.

The position is Health Educator at a rural hospital. The presentation will be before 13 people. The people consist of the position's team members and supervisor.

I always like to ask at least 2 questions at the end of every interview, but with trying to make this program plan in 1 week, I totally forgot to think of any. And I don't know what kind of questions to ask such a large group of people.

I have already asked, ""What would a successful first year look like?"" and clarifying questions about the position like, ""Is this a new position?"" ""Are there supporting positions, or does the Health Educator position work independently?"" ""The job posting prefers this qualification, why is that?"" (I asked this because I didn't have my RN license, and they ""strongly preferred"" it. Turns out the posting is outdated and they don't care about that anymore).

I currently have a job in tech in the PNW. We paid off our house and our lifestyle is pretty good. I've been a little dissatisfied at work so I applied to a job working on autonomous vehicles and I'm heading down for the onsite interview soon. The job is in Palo Alto and they are not open to remote employment.   


Pros: 

1. This kind of work is seriously in my wheelhouse and I think I can do well at it. 
2. I feel like once I get some experience in this field, it will be a very valuable skill and will lead to other opportunities if I don't end up staying at this company. 
3. My area of focus is in 3D graphics, and a lot of the jobs I'm seeing are looking for that as an afterthought, and honestly I find back end work less interesting and would love to find a place where 3D is all I have to work on. This seems to fit the bill. 
4. The salary range is good and they offer equity.   


Cons: 

1. Moving! I'm happy up here and would not choose to move to the Bay area. 
2. The cost of housing is frightening! We'd most likely go from a house that backs to the woods to an apartment.
3. Loss of our support network.
4. We live in a great foodie city and I'm not sure Sunnyvale or Mountain View will compare.

  
So even though we haven't gotten to the official offer stage, I'm weighing the whole idea and trying to see what things I need to consider.

So many questions!  


1. Should we rent out our current house in case we want to come back? Has anyone ever hired a management company and how did that work out?
2. How do I go about really comparing the cost of living? How do people survive in such a crazy housing environment?
3. How do RSUs play out in the real world? Are they ephemeral or do you consider those as actual compensation?
4. Any thoughts on where the best places to live would be if I needed to commute to Palo Alto?
5. Any thoughts on life in the Bay area?

So, I am in the tech field, developer. I will give a brief description of my current job, pros/cons, and then the one that offered me a position. Perhaps I can gain some insight from those who have a bit more experienced jumping companies. I usually spend a long time at a company. I know in the tech world, that is a no no......

I am a little on the older side (50yr - old for tech field, but i have not noticed any discrimination. I got a late start in this field, as I was previously a teacher &amp; musician), so I don't have 25yrs to make adjustments/save/take risks. I am not risk aversive. I tend to stick in one place for a long time, and i found that is detrimental in the tech field as one stagnats, gets complacent..... and even though my current company has great perks, I am very comfortable &amp; complacent. My previous job, I was there over 10yrs and said I wouldn't do that again. Again, stagnating because I was valued and just stagnated in skills. Always had to gain new skills with outside learning.

***CURRENT JOB:***

\------------------------

**title**: lead engineer

**years at company**: 4yrs

**salary**: 150k

**options**: 15k, fully vested.

**chances the company will get acquired/public soon**: Very slim, currently not profitable after ups/downs. Many funding rounds.

**Job description**: Lead, but I don't lead anything. I am just an individual contributor with a ""lead"" title to qualify the raise. Every engineer on the team is an island unto themselves, no real ""leaders"". The Project managers etc.. defer to me. But there's only 2 other engineers on the team, but they are on their own products, doing their own things.

**PROS:** Great people, company culture, take sick days, vacay w/o any issues. Come in late, leave early, all good. No issues. Basically, you get your work done, they don't care what you do. They treat you like an adult until you stop acting like one. I mean, within reason. Work from home whenever you want. People are SUPER cool. Stocked kitchen. Salary is real good. Decent benefits. Just a ton of flexibility. Transparency is important to them. Close by, 25 minute drive. They pay high to keep people.

**CONS:** In a non-profitable phase for like 7 months. Currently using funding (various funding phases). Engineering management is non-existent (no managers, no VP). Projects are half-baked, and not really thought out. Every company meeting, all sunshine and roses, everything is awesome, next few months are gonna BE AWESOME!!!! (just never lives up to the promises). CTO does not give up any power, so engineering management is either fired, or they leave. Org is very flat, no real upward mobility, and at this point my skills are stagnating. I take online courses to keep up with things, but I am not learning anymore. But those pros!!! lol.

***NEW COMPANY***

***----------------------------***

**title**: principle engineer

**salary**: 140k

**options**: 53k, 4yr vesting period.

**chances the company will get acquired/public soon**: Pretty good. Current funding from a major corporate entity. Though, of course, no guarantees... just paper at this point.

**Job description**: This is were things are a bit different. The VP was adamant that I would be doing principle/lead activities. My title would fit the job description. I would get to define/architect/mentor and lead the team.

**PROS:** Don't know. I interviewed with the people, they seem cool and engaged. All have a positive outlook and like the direction of the company. It seems a bit more serious than my current job. Close by, 30-35minute drive. I know a few people at the new company, by chance, and they all really dig the company. Possibility to really grow as a developer, and do what I was suppose to, lead/mentor/manage people.

**CONS:** They are offering 10k lower. Being that I am gonna fulfill my title duties, I am very nervous. Change you know? But I am gonna counter (see below).

\---------------- Each company has the same benefits, no 401k matching, and health is comparable ---------------------

**NOTE**: I ADJUSTED THE SALARIES SLIGHTLY FROM THEIR REAL VALUES, BUT DIFF IS THE SAME, PERCENTAGE WISE.

    MY COUNTER: 145k, Accelerated Vesting. &lt;-- what do you think.

"Look, this may come out as stupid but these are just merely observations from my end.

So the tech industry is at an all-time high, with everything nowadays being on-demand it's easier to do business with each other. To me this shows how much things have changed just for the past 10 years.

Back then software developers were the elite in their field churning out great products with technical wizardry (of course not without its issues!). Devs were either CS, IT, or Computer Engineering graduates. Now almost anyone can be a software developer or can work in the tech industry. Especially in the advent of cloud ERP systems / SaaS, professionals from other industries are flocking in. Gone are the days where the technical people ruled the tech world. Now you get left behind if you only have hardcore technical knowledge in hardware and software, you had to have the industry expertise in the products they're delivering. For example at a cloud ERP company, business and accountancy graduates usually outperform IT grads due to their understanding of the product.

What does this mean for the tech industry? I think it's awesome that we get to have people with industry experience on board, but this certainly instills fear for the IT people where their technical expertise is put to the side as they now have to learn industries outside of their own. This makes room for growth and career development.

I also see the issue of burnout and the changes of the work environment. With everything being on-demand, consumer patience is usually lower than zer0 and want things to be up and running ASAP. Who can blame them? They invested money and/or time on the product, and want answers right away. This may have lead to some poor work-life balance with some tech employees having to work on shifts or lose weekends to resolve an issue.

In a world where we value convenience and availability over functionality and reliability, it's easy to see why tech has to change this way. It has made our world smaller, and transact with people around the world in mere seconds.

Tech employees are today's factory workers.

Look, I may be wrong with my observations so feel free to prove me wrong. We're just learning here.",My personal observation with the Tech Industry,1
"I'm 32, and a few years back became effectively dehbilitated overnight due to a prescription med. I had to leave my job/career/lost all my money and have been surviving off disability since.

I'm gradually recovering although daily life can still be a struggle with the symptoms. I'm often in pain and discomfort and struggle going out (I've lived most of the past 2.5 years in a room).

My family are fairly dysfunctional and for the most part I've been dealing with this by myself. I'm currently living with a parent temporarily as my last housemate became an alcoholic and I didn't feel secure in our joint tenancy. So I thought I'd come here for 6 months-1 year before being able to get back out on my own.
But now this situation has become stressful (I think both my parents are going through severe mental health issues).

Ultimately I feel I need to move out asap; prioritise self-preservation and ""put on my own oxygen mask first"".

So here's my question (to enable this within the circumstantial parameters): what are the realistic options for making money through a laptop?

I'm very creative and good at designing/communication but also attracted to decent paying online work (who isn't!) which I feel might be in other sectors..?

I currently make some money as an artist/illustrator with the odd commission but feel a bit overwhelmed with marketing potential (i.e where to start) and have no real capital for investment. 
I do feel maybe learning Photoshop could open up more avenues, but again, more investment and seems like a saturated market?

I'm a songwriter and have a profile on Fiverr offering my services as a musician (saxophonist)/lyricist but again, seems to be overly saturated and not really consistent.

I'm tempted to look into things like tech/marketing/coding/copywriting..anything that can bring in fairly decent money that I can work on at night (when I'm in less pain) but I just don't feel I have the luxury of time to explore all the options and then invest time in teaching myself loads of new skills.

It could take me 6 months+ just focusing on 1 thing to even -maybe- be competitive enough to gain clients in any field.

So I'm just wondering what people's thoughts are on this? Maybe someone has been in a similar position and somehow rebuilt their finances/life back up through a laptop?",Creating financial stability whilst debilitated?,1

"I don't know how to keep this short, but I'll try. I'm a 30 F creative/tech professional who works for a huge but not well-known company. I have a history of trauma, PTSD, and ADD which I mask well but sometimes impedes me a lot. I've been rejected, abused, and disrespected A LOT in my life and anything that reminds me of that fact is hugely triggering. I don't deal well with criticism, internalize *everything*, and tend to retreat into myself when it happens.

The company culture I work in is toxic. That's a fact. There's disorganization, mismanagement, and scapegoating galore. Sycophants are rewarded, and everyone else can go fuck themselves. The managers cover their own asses and throw others under the bus to save themselves. We've had two rounds of firings, and some good people leave on their own because they couldn't take it anymore. I've managed to keep my head above the fray for the most part and accept that getting shit on is a normal part of the experience here.

I pressured my manager to give me a performance review (they don't like doing them) in July, and they didn't have anything too negative to say as well as some good feedback. They turned down my request for a raise, a title change -- ANYTHING. They told me that they could be open to paying for educational opportunities if I stumbled upon anything I wanted to take and took note of some tooling I requested to help me.

None of those things happened. My request for tooling has been slow-walked, and my boss rejected my request to expense a $500 class. (Keep in mind this is a multi-billion dollar company but they do this shit to everyone). This was a big knock to my confidence and made me feel like I have no value to this company. When my confidence gets knocked, it's hard to invest in work, but I've done my best to carry one. Unfortunately, my good work friend who I worked with closely left at the end of last month, leaving a big gap in the process. I started getting a lot of ad hoc assignments that are hard to keep up with, and with feeling depressed, my attention to detail slipped as I started to feel overwhelmed and no place to ask for help.

Last week, the shit hit the fan in my personal life. Without going into too much detail, I got doxxed and harassed on the internet by an unstable, vicious person. He slandered my name and professional reputation all over social media and tweeted my name and image at all hours for four days. He even tweeted me @ my company though I'm not sure if anyone saw it. This was profoundly stressful and the aftermath still is as I don't know if it's going to rear its head again. I told both of my managers about it in case he tried to contact them. They told me I was safe and seemed concerned for my wellbeing.

Today, I had my monthly performance check-in with my direct manager. He basically told me that my performance during the last month has been nothing short of disappointing. Nothing I've done has been up to snuff, but he wants to ""help me succeed."" (Surrrre) He enumerated something awful about just about every project I've worked on. And told me that my work is inconsistent, I require too much oversight, and I can't take direction. The only thing I've done right this month? The polls I post in Slack are funny and good for our culture. So basically, none of my extensive work on our products drives value or is good enough.

I knew I'd been a little disengaged this month, but the fact that he would tell me that my performance is suddenly terrible after I'd disclosed to him that I'm the victim of a harasser doesn't seem like a coincidence. It's clear I've been marked as a liability by these managers and should GTFO before they push me out. I'm not happy to say that I broke down in the meeting and admitted I was having a hard time with my mental health and PTSD with flashbacks (ugh, stupid, I know, but I was just so, so upset and embarrassed). He said the boilerplate manager things about that and said they could connect me to ""resources.""

I know this is the death knell for my career here. I've been in touch with recruiters and am getting submitted for jobs left and right and have some phone screenings. I think I've got about a month before I'm cut, but this is terrible for my mental health, and I'm not sure how I can stay engaged with my work here knowing that my manager wants me out. How can I continue to work here AND maintain my confidence in interviewing/job searching?

Has anyone ever bounced back from something like this? I feel like I'm living in an absolute hellscape and honestly, if it weren't for my fiance, I'd probably blow up my life -- start over in a new city -- or fucking end it.

\*TLDR:\*

Have a history of trauma. Workplace is toxic and I've been feeling stressed here for a long time but keeping my head above water. I got doxxed by a harasser on the internet. Told my managers because I was concerned about safety/him contacting them. They seemed supportive. Now, a week later, I'm getting terrible performance feedback and know I'm being pushed out of this role. I broke down crying, admitted I had PTSD and was struggling with severe stress and mental health -- bad move. Now trying to scramble to find other opportunities, but my psyche is damaged immensely by this and doesn't feel resilient enough to get through this with my career and self-worth intact.","I'm having one of the most traumatic, stressful weeks of my career.

"Hello,

I'm a 25 year old Real Estate/Finance Professional. I feel like I am at a crossroads with my career in the sense that I have to dedicate more time to my work, based on seniority and experience, and I find this proposition slightly daunting. 

I as a consultant in a reputable global company which was a very good experience in the first year. However, in my second year, an ED (my manager) left, and was not replaced, meaning that his workload was then split between myself and another colleague. This was a great step up in responsibility, but I have noticed standards dropping in other parts of the business, and have raised this to senior management, to no avail. I have also found it increasingly difficult to get support and the workload being relatively demanding. This has hampered on client service and has in a way damaged my reputation in the industry slightly. Revenue targets are also aggressive, and stressful to a degree. 

However, there are of course, positives about this job, which is that it provides good hours (compared to other roles of similar pay).  This is also because I manage a lot of the time lines, and have a bit of flexibility.  My issue is that I don't believe what we do at the company is industry standard, and I am worried that I will become irrelevant in my industry.  

I considered staying, on the basis that this job provides good remuneration for the hours I work, and potentially staying around and 'managing' work, which is what a lot of the senior people in the company do. (i.e. they attend work to get paid).  The pros to this would be being able to do things outside of work (I am starting up an online store).

On the flip side, I can aggressively grow myself (and my salary) in the industry. I have been interviewing for a job with a large reputable REPE firm, and while this job will be averaging 11 hours a day, it will provide me with immense industry experience and set me up for the future. Pay would be better on an absolute basis, but on a per hour basis, it would be much worse. I am seeing this as an investment in industry knowledge more so than a pay increase. 

TLDR: Should I stay in a mediocre job that pays relatively well and  has good hours/start a business on the side vs working long hours for experience and knowledge and developing my career (pay and knowledge wise)

"Hello Internet,

I'm currently in a dilemma. As I have just entered Senior year of high school, I am faced with many questions about the future. I am planning on attending a local university, and am faced with what I should peruse. My father is an electrical/mechanical engineer who owns a business, and with the influence from him to become a engineer, I'm thinking about majoring in Mechanical Engineering, since I take more interest from that vs. Electrical Engineering. (Mechanical Engineering - Design is more of what I seem to enjoy). 

I, on the other half, really love history. Ever since I took AP European History, AP United States History, and am currently taking AP Gov. &amp; Pol. (which, as so far, I seem to enjoy Gov. the most, then Euro) I have developed a passion for the topic of History. With my current class of Gov., I'm really enjoying learning about government and how it has relations to history. After looking at what majors I can get with these interests, I have found that I could major in Political Science and History. 

I would love to study history and gov. in university, but I'm in doubt on what jobs I could get with a major in these subjects. It seems to me as I could get a more stable, well paying job in mechanical engineering rather than a liberal arts major such as Political Science and History. I would like to have a career in which I know will be reliable long term, stable would be an ideal word for it. 

I know that one should pursue their passions, regardless of other variables, but I don't want to major in something that is, per say, ""useless"" (no offense, really). I'm just trying to figure what I could do with all of these majors. I don't want to major in something and not get a job in relation to the major, and end up working in a coffee shop.

I know that with history major, one could go into education and teach history, but that has not appealed to me. Political Science, I have heard many graduates go into Law school, which seems cool. I'm not exactly sure on what Law school is, and what the career for that means, hence I cannot make a judgement on it, so information would be helpful. What other career options could I get with these two majors?

I thought about majoring in both Mechanical Engineering and Political Science, what do you think about this idea?

Any advice would be helpful! Especially people who have a occupation in the field of study or have majored in any of these studies.

You can also watch this as an [Animated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72S-AIWgmTw) instead if you prefer. 

  
**Step 1: Make a deadline for deciding which career or experiment to try first**

Remember parkinsons law: ""work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"". So the more time you give yourself. The more time you are going to use and still achieve the same thing.

  
**Step 2: Make a list of what you enjoy**Here you can ask yourself questions such as:

* What subjects could I read 500 books about without getting bored?
* What would I do if I had all the money I would ever need?
* What did I enjoy as a child?
* Think of a really exciting day in the past. What were you doing?
* What am I curious about?
* What are you doing when you lose track of time?
* What makes you feel alive?

These questions are all useful, but the only way to be 100% sure about whether you enjoy doing something is to actually do it and see how much you enjoy it.

  
**Step 3: Make a list of your core values:**

* How do I behave?
* Who do I admire and why?
* Imagine you could start your life over again. What values would you live by?

You don't have to be clear about your values now, since you'll get to know them through experience.

  
**Step 4: Make a list of what kind of work conditions you prefer**

* How important is money?
* What kind of lifestyle should the career be able to support?
* Indoor vs. outdoor work
* Talk with people, use your hands or sit behind a computer?
* Is job security important?
* Do you want to have your own business or work for someone else?
* Is an oppurtunity for growth important to you?
* Do you thrive in a high stress environment

Keep in mind that it will be much easier for you to answer these questions when you have actually started your career.

  
**Step 5: Make a list of your skills**

* What comes easy to you?
* What am I doing when I lose track of time?
* What made me stand out as a child?
* What do people complement me on?
* Which things does people ask me to help them with?
* What things makes me feel strong?
* What comes naturally to me?

I can also recoomend taking the CliftonStrenghts test to find your strenghts.Remember that you don't HAVE to be an expert right now. You need a growth mindset, which means that you believe you can improve if you practice.It's also again important to remember that the best way of knowing what your strenghts are is to actually do things and see what you're good at.  
Now you have a list of what you enjoy, your core values, what work conditions you prefer and your skillsIf you feel like you could add more to them you can:

* Google common passions, core values, skills and so on to get inspired
* Ask your friends to evaluate what they think your core values, passions, skills and so on are to get another perspective.
* Self assesment test online (The big five and careerexplorer.com)

Don't worry if you're not sure about everything on your lists. Most people don't know that much about themselves. The only way to know more about yourself for sure is to test and get some real world experience.

  
**Step 6: Make a list of careers that seem aligned with your list of what you enjoy, your core values, the work conditions you prefer and your skills.**

If you can't think of anything you can:

* See which careers are recommended to you when you take self assesment tests.
* Find a list of careers online and see which ones seem interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 7: Get more clarity on the careers on your list and remove those that seem less aligned with what you want.**You can start by removing those you are sure you can remove.For example if:

* You don't want to sit on the computer for more than one hour everyday, then you can drastically reduce your options
* If you want to work from home, you can remove all careers where that isn't possible
* If you want to start your own business, then you can remove all those that don't support that

If you want more clarity on the careers on your list before you eliminate anything, then you can:

* Talk to people in those professions or job shadow them
* Research the careers
* Look at concrete job offers
* Talk with career counselor, friends, Career Coach or someone else, to get more clarity.
* Journal

Getting clarity this way will also help you later when you have to make the decision!

  
**Step 8: Make sure fear or limiting beliefs don't hold you back from pursuing something you want**

To find your fears you can ask yourself:

* What am I afraid of?

And to find your limiting beliefs, you can ask yourself

* If I don't believe I can become good at this career, then why do I think that way?

For your fears you can simply define the worst case scenario and that way maybe realise it's something you can livewith.For your limiting beliefs you can ask yourself questions such as:

* where does this belief come from?
* What would this belief look like from another persons perspective?
* What would be some counter examples to this belief?
* What price do I pay for having this limiting belief?
* Another belief that might be more accurate?

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 9: Decide which career to pursue or an experiment to try**

Okay now it's finally time to PULL THE TRIGGER!So now you can either choose the first career you want to try or run an experiment to test some of your core values, skills, passions or prefered working conditions.If you can't try the career without commiting to alot, then it's probably best to run some experiments first, so you can verify if you actually want that career, before you invest too much into it.  
But wait.. how do you make the final decision on which career to try out first?You can either:

* Use your rational mind and weight up the pro's and con's
* Go with your gut instinct.

Several studies have shown that your ratinal mind is better for simple decisions, while your gut instinct is better for complex decisions where you can't easily compare all available information.I will make another video that describes more about when you should listen to your gut instinct and when you should use your rational mind  
Finally you can ask yourself: ""Would I regret this decision on my death bed?""If you wouldn't then it's time to try it 🙂

  
**Step 10: If you found your ideal career then that's great. Otherwise, go back to step 1.**But... how can you know if you found your ideal career?  
These are some of the signs that you have picked the right thing:

* You look forward to getting to work
   * Or at least you don't experience the sunday blues
* You may even experience flow
* You feel alignment
* If people ask: ""Do you like your career?"" You are not hesitant to say: ""yes!"".
* You want to become good at what you do
* Time flies away quickly when working
* You feel engaged
* You talk happily about work outside work

&amp;#x200B;

Well.. Does that always mean you should quit your career if you don't experience those things?Here are some exceptions:

* Maybe you need to give it some more time
   * Maybe it will be more fun when you are more competent?
   * Maybe you just picked something that is too difficult as a beginner?
   * If you read ""Be so good they can't ignore you"" by Cal Newport, then you'll know that you need Career capital (Rare and valuable skills) in order to satisfy your 3 universal psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness, which are the things that will make you happy in a career.
* Maybe you are just in the wrong company
* Remember all people have bad days and no career is fun all the time.
* And remember the grass is always greener on the other side.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you've considered all these things and still want to do something else, then just go back to step 1

* Update your list of what you enjoy, your personal values, what work conditions you prefer and your skills
* Make a new list of careers
* Get clarity on them and eliminate those that are less aligned with what you want
* make sure fear and limiting beliefs don't hold you back
* Decide on a new career or experiment to try
* If you found your ideal career then that's great. Otherwise just repeat the process

I made [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duzjh11qp5s) video about how to choose a career when you have TOO many options! 

&amp;#x200B;

# My story:

Let me tell you where I was 3 years ago.

I was just about to enter my 2 gap years and I made a goal. I wanted to know which career out of all possible careers is the best one for me. So I researched all possible careers and all the different kinds of education I could take to get there. I tried to make a list of my passions, my skills, my core values and what kind of work conditions I prefer. I made a list of all possible careers I could take that seemed just slightly interesting. I compared all the different careers one by one and eliminated those that were less aligned with my passions, skills, core values and what I wanted in a career. I was able to eliminate careers until I only was considering about 12 different careers. Then I spend the remaining of the 2 years just researching those careers and making pro's and con's list and contemplating which one I should choose. I wanted to pick the perfect one. But no matter how much I researched and thought about it, I didn't get any further, because I made one crucial mistake.

I only thought about and researched the different careers, instead of just trying them. Thinking about the careers and researching them gave me some clarity, but I should have spend less time on that and more time testing them out.

I did play music and started programming though, and that gave me some clarity about what I wanted to do.

So to make sure you don't make the same mistake as me, I want to give you a step by step plan for navigating between all these different career opportunities you have.

&amp;#x200B;

# Remember when trying to choose a career you'll have to know:

* What you want in a career
   * What you enjoy
   * What your core values are
   * What work conditions you prefer
* What the market wants
* What you can provide.

&amp;#x200B;

If we make some generalizations there are **4 ways for you to get the answer to these questions:**

1. Contemplate (Thinking and journaling)
2. Ask other people (In-person and online)
3. Research
4. Get real-world experience

&amp;#x200B;

# My crucial mistake:

The good thing about contemplating, asking other people and researching is that it can be a fast way to narrow down your options to a more manageable list. But at some point, you won't get more clarity this way. I wasted almost 2 years just contemplating, asking other people and researching. A few months would have been more than enough.

**In my case, I was still left with questions, such as:**

* Would I rather do something technical or more creative?
* Do I want to work in a company or have my own business?
* Am I sure that I want to sit down in front of a computer for at least 8 hours a day?

How would I ever be able to answer these questions by only contemplating, asking other people and researching? I needed to test out the different careers or make experiments to find the answers to these questions, but unfortunately, I didn't realize that back then...

I tried to choose the perfect career the first time by just thinking about it. The problem with that approach is that we learn which career we want from real-world experience, but I was only thinking about what the best choice would be.

I should instead have taken a more iterative approach where I think about what the best career choice would be, then try that or an experiment and get some feedback I can use to choose the next career if I'm not satisfied with the current choice.

&amp;#x200B;

# So this is what the process could look like:

Step 1: Make a deadline for when you decide on the first career to try (To make sure you don't just stay contemplating)

Step 2: Make a list of what you enjoy (Because you have to look forward to getting to work)

Step 3: Make a list of your core values (Because your career has to be congruent with these values)

Step 4: Make a list of what kind of work conditions you prefer (Because how can you get something, if you haven't defined what it is?)

Step 5: Make a list of your skills (Because how can you get paid for something you can't do? But remember to have a growth mindset and realize you can learn skills)

Step 6: Make a list of careers that seem aligned with your list of what you enjoy, your core values,the work conditions you prefer and your skills.

Step 7: Get more clarity on the careers on your list and remove those that seem less aligned with what you want.

Step 8: Make sure fear or limiting beliefs don't hold you back from pursuing something you want

Step 9: Decide which career to pursue or an experiment to try

Step 10: If you found your ideal career then that's great. Otherwise, go back to step 1.

Give it a read and let me know if I can help in anyway.

"Hi reddit.  Looking for some advice.

The past three years I have been with a reputable aerospace company, Embraer, as a full time employee with benefits.  Recently I was offered a higher paying position working for a contractor who's customer is NASA in Brevard County, Florida.  I am new to being a contract employee (this position does include benefits) but I thought it was a good opportunity for me to get into a more technical position in the field and get involved with the space program.

Long story short, Embraer counter offered me with a promotion to a lead position of my department with slightly higher pay and the opportunity for overtime.  Time off and 401k benefits are very close in comparison between both jobs.  Am I foolish to leave a promotion in leadership to join a contract position, or is a risk worth taking.

I'm starting to become a bit crazy as it seems nothing one does will end being the right choice.   
I'm struggling while dealing always with the 2 contradictory views of almost anything work related, stuff like:

*You are too young, you should work your ass in finding a good company to develop your full potential and learn*   vs.  **Stay in a company because if not it seems you are not loyal, you dont have your ideas clear and you are a potential bad worker that will move when gets a better oppotunity.**

*Focus on love what you do, enjoy your tasks and dont worry aobut money as it will eventually come later*    vs    **Work for money in something you dont like, that's adulthood, it's better to pay the bills and afford a house rather than enjoy a job, because it is a job after all, it is not supposed to be nice.**

It gets mentally exhausting at times (I know that it happens with every job) and also I got pretty bored of it. I don’t want the latter to sound harsh, I do love what I am doing now but I kind of feel like I could do more.

I was thinking of going into media/design as that has been a dream that was put on hold so many times that I just kind of gave up on it.

"I feel like every major decision I have made regarding my career was only made because I felt pressured.

I went to college directly after high school with the original intention of getting a degree in biology because I knew that STEM was employable. I hated it, and halfway through my degree I couldn't take it any more. I switched to history because I love history, and I really excelled for the rest of my college career (was given funded research opportunities, TA positions, and a lot of meaningless awards). I worked in a public library from the time I had graduated high school until a little after college graduation. I did really well there too, but I realized that upward mobility (aka, getting a full time position) was not going to happen. No one ever leaves. I decided I needed to go to grad school and researched my options. I chose to move cities to enroll in a Masters in public administration program. I literally chose the school because it was close to home and I had family and friends in the city. I did do a bit of research on the program, but it was not what I expected. I tried to stick it out, but the program wasn't teaching me anything that I felt was interesting or useful, so rather than continue to waste my money, I dropped the program and moved back home. Around the same time, a position opened up in a government office back home and I got the job. I was ecstatic...

Until recently, when I realized that I hate it. My job isn't really about helping people and making things better for the people, it's about pushing paper and crunching numbers. My experience has taught me a few things about myself.

1) I don't ever want to work for the government again.

2) I don't want to do a desk job. I want to do something hands-on.

The tech, machinery, and mostly the money of the oilfield quickly derailed my initial plans. 15 years later, I'm definitely far out earning any degree I could have obtained.

However I'm not blind to the times and unstoppable forward progress of man. Eventually my industry will shrink and I will need a solid foundation to fall back on.

"I got this email today :

1) You advised me you were going to make up your time and yet every time I have come by I have been advised you have already left for the

day? I have on multiple occasions advised you that communication plays a key factor in this role. I really need you to work on that.


2) Secondly I have observed you slouched down in your chair. Now comments are starting to come my way. This is not a casual environment. It’s a place of business.

Even if you have slow periods that gives you an opportunity (as we have already discussed) to learn some of our internal processes. I’ve assigned you some tasks

as well that you can work on during slow periods. Just communicate with the team that you may step away or learn our imaging process. There are plenty of things you can

do to keep busy. Be mindful of that.



3) I have also noticed you on several times on your personal phone, or closing or flipping your screen when I come by and then you have no applications open your just sitting there?

There are things you could be learning to better equip you to handle afternoon shift and what types of calls we get. Even looking through the tickets will give you descriptions on some

of our solutions. That’s why I took you off afternoon shift and on-call to give you an opportunity to learn.

For the chair part. I am a big guy and I keep on sliding on the chair and have to constantly fix myself.

"I currently like my job and the people I work with. Yes, there are  stresses and yes, I would like to make more money, but for the most part, I'm fairly comfortable here. I can't remember the last time I had a ""Oh God, it's Monday feeling."" I recently applied to a job to see what  was out there. This may be one of two jobs I've applied to all year.  They contacted me back and since then, I've had two interviews, with a  follow up formality interview on the way. It looks like the new company  is going to offer me the job. I have not seen or felt any major red flags with the potential hiring company. It will definitely be more  money, more vacation time, and it is a much larger company. The downside  is that it is an unknown and working with some stuff that I don't have a  lot of experience with.

Some backstory, I've been with my current employer for about 3.5  years. A little over a year ago, I left this company because the  environment was dysfunctional due to the supervisor at the time. The other job I  took was even worse than that situation and because of the  disorganization of that company, they let go of the contractors they  hired, including me after two months. I asked for my old job back (at the company I'm in  now). They were gracious enough to hire me back. Due to management changes made shortly after my return,  the environment is much better.

When I applied to this job that I'm about to be offered, I never  thought that it would get to this stage. (I was just practicing really) I  don't want to make another mistake and leave a place where I know I am content and get along with my co-workers and go somewhere that might be great or might not work out...again. I also don't want to repay my  current employer with treachery after they did me a kindness a year ago.  Any advice or thoughts? Lmk if questions about my background or industry will help clarify.

"I have changed companies two years ago. On paper, and during the interviews, my former and current job descriptions looked very similar. In practice, after the change I feel I'm doing the work I used to do 7 years ago in my career. I have barely any managerial responsibilities, and I feel my skills and knowledge are not a very valuable asset for the team. 

During the interviews, I was assured that they worked with projects, and I would manage one from start to end. The problem is that what they call projects is barely a small task, that requires a single coder, and not much interaction with other teams. Technically, the tasks are not very challenging,  I am feeling frustrated, and I don't work as efficiently as I used to. I thought that this could be a phase, but I've waited for two years and I'm sure that this is the business model.

The problem now it's that my old job would map better with a much senior position in this team. I've thought that maybe I could move internally to other team, but that would require a conversation with my manager. He is a very approachable person, but I don't know how to have a conversation about this, or whether it's even a good idea.

"\[First time posting... and I'm sorry it's LONG.\]

I'm unhappy at work :(  According to my manager, I've consistently exceeding the manager's expectation and  I've saved the her asses many many times. Every time she will say that she really appreciated what I've done and said all the flowery words about my contributions, however, there's never real action being taken. Recently, I asked for a promotion/raise, she just brushed it off and even show how disturbing the conversation was for her... My manager is Asian who moved to the US after college, not sure if this matters. Other things that bother me the most are the unfairness and untransparency going on in the team, has been like this for a long time and this disgusts me. Maybe I'm really not doing as great as I thought, or even I AM doing great but she doesn't want to promote me cos she has a tendency to only promote or lean to those who will 'obey her', 'follow the orders' instead of people that who want to do things right and not afraid of giving honest advice and suggestions. I'm sorry if I make it sounds like a cultural thing...

Some more context: I'm a female, working at non-technical **niche field**. I have been looking for jobs and applying here and there for the past half-year. I got to have interviews with two big companies, both got rejected at the end. I'm still looking, but many jobs out there don't meet the total compensation that I'm making now. Since I'm in a niche field, it makes it harder for me to find another job. I've thought about quitting but without another job lining up I'm afraid if I quit, it can take months (6 if lucky) for me to find another job that will match up to what I'm getting now.

I know I'm too coward to quit my job. Getting rejecting by the companies that I wanted to join and not having success at my current job and looking for jobs, in general, is making me have some confidence issue. My husband got a good chunk of raises 2 years in a row. Now he's about to switch to another company. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for him. However, looking at myself, my current situation, I just feel even more depressed and worthless.

"I work two jobs (Job A and Job B), and can't afford to lose either of them. I recently got a full-time promotion at Job B. I have been working at Job A for almost 2 years, and Job B for almost 1. Upon being hired for Job B, it was established that I was coming into this job with set availability and a condition that if they were to hire me, I could not work Saturdays, but I would work every Sunday in exchange. An agreement was made and I became their new cashier. 

Time passes without a problem and I get promoted at Job B to the Front End Supervisor. When I got this promotion, I made it clear that I would still be working my other job and that my prior employment agreement still stands. I opened up my availability to show that the only day I am unavailable is Saturdays, where I would be working at Job A. 

However, Job B has decided to no longer respect my terms of employment and has been scheduling me for Saturdays anyways. I have had to leave Job A mid shift to head to Job B to accommodate these hours and it has been hurting my position at Job A. At this point, my ONLY HOURS at Job A are on Saturdays.

I spoke to the manager at Job B about this and it seemed promising. She said, ""You've made your concern known and it's clear that you're stressed about this, so I will take this weight off of your shoulders and I will speak to the boss about it for you, since she's the one that wanted you to work Saturday."" But the day after that conversation, the manager had scheduled me yet again for another Saturday. 



TL;DR: Upon being hired at second job, I said I'd work no Saturdays bc of my first job. Got a promotion and started getting scheduled for Saturday. Expressed concern and was scheduled for another Saturday.

"Hey all,

As the title says, I started a new position about 3 months ago. It’s a salaried position for a small company. I should note that I stayed with my previous employers for 1.5 years, and left to move to a big city and pursue better opportunities. 

Here are some potential red flags:

1. Last Friday I was getting ready to leave and my manager asked in a very rude tone, “What are you doing?” I was confused at the question and replied, “I’m... going home.” My manager then said, “It’s only 4 o’clock.” To which I said, “Yeah, and I got in at 7:30...”  This turned into a 30 minute “talking” which kept me there even longer. Basically, my manager was upset that I wasn’t staying longer but my manager gets in at 10:30 and doesn’t understand that I come in early (which was previously talked about and deemed OK). Nothing was really resolved from the conversation. I just reiterated my reasoning for wanting to work earlier hours due to my commute (which can go up to 1.5hrs each way if I leave during peak times). Just remembering now that I even worked through lunch that day too lol... 

2. The company I work for calls themselves “family.” In fact, a large number of upper management (including my manager) is actually family... I found this out about a week after I started. I’m curious to see what you all think, but I think this is a red flag to me.

Should I dip out now and find something new? I love what I do, but this is looking to be a bad fit for me as far as company culture goes. I’m in a very big city, so finding new work (especially in my field) won’t be too difficult.

"Hi r/Jobs! First time poster, so please let me know if this isn't the right place to post. 

I've been at my current job basically since it opened, about 4 years ago. I'm currently the most senior employee on staff (aside from the owners). When the company opened, it was extremely lax (understandably so), we had only about 10 employees. There were no time off limits and we were able to adjust our own schedules as we saw fit (as long as we made our assigned hours there was no problem). I work in the in-home/school therapy field (for context) and am assigned a certain amount of hours per client per week (usually around 12-15). So if I had an appointment on a Thursday afternoon I was able to stay longer periods the rest of the week to make up for that day. 

The company has grown SIGNIFICANTLY over the past 4 years. Understandably so, limits were put in place when other individuals started to take advantage of it (like moving around their whole week to get every Friday off). We went from no limit to time off, to no limit but excessive requests were monitored, to 5 days of PTO/5 days of UTO (considered your ""sick"" time). We were also blocked out from taking time off for a month around Spring Break, the first and last days of school were blocked out, and you're only allowed to take off time around EITHER Christmas OR Thanksgiving. 

Due to the nature of our field 5 days off a year for ""sick"" time was ridiculous. We work closely with children which are frequently brought in sick so there constantly something going around. So they implemented a ""if you go over you allotted time, you need to speak to the owner to request more time"". 

This past year they added a new benefit for seniority. For each year you have been employed with the company, you are given 1 day of additional PTO (since I've been with the company for 3 full years I was given 3 additional days). This was awesome because next year, my fiance and I are going on our honeymoon to Japan and I wanted to go for 2 weeks.  So when I went to request the time off for next year, I was told that the additional days provided for each year you'd have been working there, was going to be removed. Instead if you've been there 3 years, you'll only receive one additional day and can choose to roll over one day from the year prior. 

So basically, I'm losing two days of PTO. This is infuriating because it feels like I should be gaining more benefits from staying with a company for long, not LOSING, and if feels personal because very few employees are reaching their 3 year mark soon. I'm the only one AT 3 years. 

Has this ever happened to you, or do you have any advice on how to go about dealing with this? I like my company a lot, and would hate to leave it, but honestly this feels very unfair. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

I've been with my company for almost 4 years. The company was very relaxed initially, got bigger and then implemented new PTO/UTO policies (5/5 + 1 day per year there), and are now removing the 1 day per year benefit and instead changing to 1 day per 3 years you've been there with blockouts when you can use your time (1 month blocked out for spring break, first and last days of school blocked out, and can pick EITHER Thanksgiving or Christmas).

"I am in a sort of unique situation.

Second thing, a week and a half ago-ish, I requested off of work for this Friday, the 18th so I can take me driving test to get my license. As of right now, I ride my bike to and from work. When I checked the new schedule, the didn’t give me the day off. I talked to the Manager and they still want me to come into work and start at 4:45. I talked to them a little more about why I want the day off and they said they will let me know tomorrow when I come to work.
If they don’t give me the day off, what should I do? They haven’t done much of anything for me as an employee so should I quit?

I’d like some advice, thanks in advance!",Need Advice Please,0

"Background info: I’m a 22M that just finished undergrad and started my first “big boy job” a month ago. It’s not a bad job per se, it just doesn’t click with me. I think my biggest gripes are how much I work (50 hours per week) and my physical overall work environment, and the overall boredom I feel being here. 

Today: I got called into my managers office to go over how my first month has been. She asked the above question and I legitimately didn’t know what to say. I ended up just talking to her about how I enjoyed that I’ve been learning about an industry I didn’t know much about (which is true), and we moved on.

"Hi all,

I don't know how or what to do right now. I'm now seven months into my new position with a well known company. I love my job, my coworkers, and the type of duties I am responsible for. 

Within a month I have made so many good relationships with my colleagues, including one coworker whom I found out (pieced together from various times so it took a while to realize she was indeed toxic) was considered toxic to the team. Many times she would tell me that our team or whom was toxic or rude to her. Her story is one sided and I know that she may have twisted the story around. However, outside of work or outside of a work relationship, I believe she is a good person. 

She is considered a toxic person because she goes against processes that have already been established and disrupts them, among a few other things. I heard that she was also put on a performance plan and I know it means she will be fired, assuming she doesn't meet those goals that are outlined in the plan. 

I am in good relationship with my own manager, who also works with the toxic/about to be fired colleague. Should I propose that instead of documenting ways to get this colleague fired that we instead help her find a new position at a different company? I say this because this so-called toxic person is my friend and I don't want her to leave the company feeling bitter, if she were to get fired. 

Or should I completely ignore it? To watch/let her get on the performance plan anyway, since the company/team have already placed her on it. Maybe I really should set aside my feelings and not think about this situation at all. Anyone faced a similar dillema?",Employee is going to get fired.

"I have been working at the current company I’m with for 2.5 years as a Jr. QA Analyst. I have dedicated any spare time that I have to teaching myself Selenium with Java. I started using it to automate my testing about a year and a half ago because I was getting tired of manual testing. My manager took notice of this and he moved me to another project to do manual testing and to update their automated testing whenever a new feature was added to the software. About a month ago I had my review where my manager gave me a score of “exceeds expectations”,  but he gave me a couple of goals to hit in order to receive a promotion at the end of the year. However, I have had two previous meetings where he set goals for me to hit to get a promotion in a few months. I hit those goals and I have yet to get a promotion, so I feel like I’m being led on. I haven’t pushed the issue because I know the company isn’t profitable yet. Once one of our projects goes live (in December) and we enter the maintenance part of the contract, the company should have more financial flexibility to give promotions and raises. 

That being said, I’ve been applying to QA Engineer positions so that I’ll at least have some options in case I don’t receive a promotion by the end of the year.

I also talked with the recruiter and he said that the position offers health, dental, and 401k benefits after the first 3 months. The recruiter might be trying to sell me on the position though, so I will ask the manager about the benefits during the interview. It is a 9 month contract to hire position, which definitely carries the risk of short term employment. However, at double my current income, doing primarily automation, and possibly having benefits included it might be worth it.

\----

Two competing Digital Forensics / Incident Response firms offered me very similar positions at the same time. The recruiters I was working with at each were aware that I was interviewing at the other firm, and that things were heading toward offers being made. 

The base compensation is exactly the same, with the only difference being that Company A offered me a 5k signing bonus and Company B offered a 10k. In terms of benefits, Company A has better benefits (including 100% employer-paid health insurance), but is a bit of a dumpster fire by the looks of it (more info below). Company B has good benefits, but is much more professional / polished, and is lead by some incredibly smart folks in the cybersecurity industry. 

During my interview with Company A, I had the opportunity to meet with the team I would be managing. I was told some concerning things, such as: ""Hope you weren't promised bonuses, because those don't get paid out."" (I was told I could count on ""aggressive bonuses"" around 20 - 30% of my salary (140k)), ""Our clients have no money."", ""We can't hit our utilization."", etc.. These were extremely concerning, and made every red flag in my head go off. Additionally, I felt as though I wasn't asked enough technical questions to make a fair assessment about if I could actually deliver on the job I was applying for... And this is not an entry-level position. It would be at the Manager / Associate Director level, reporting to the Director.

For these reasons, I am planning on turning down the opportunity with Company A, and accepting Company B. However.. here is the twist: I was incredibly confident that I wanted to accept Company A **until I met the team**. I told the recruiter I was working with that I was almost 100% sure I would be accepting if an offer was made... fast forward to now, and I no longer want the position.

I don't know how to kindly, but firmly, say ""No Thank You"" without burning a bridge / having to go into detail about why I don't want the position. I don't want the folks at Company A to get in trouble for saying these things to me, but I also don't want to light myself on fire by hopping into the dumpster with them.

His previous bosses were all shitheads that won’t give their employees vacation in summer and expects them to work overtime without more pay.

He loved his job, but working in this field frustrated him more and more because he knew he was taken advantage of and couldn’t do anything because it’s like this almost everywhere, plus it doesn’t really have a perspective. He started a new job (training? it’s called ‘Ausbildung’ in germany) as an industrial mechanic/CNC mechanic and he is really not sure if that suits him.. all he does is putting the material in the machine and take it out after it’s finished and then polishing it. He’s massively underwhelmed with these tasks and i totally understand this. He can’t program the machines yet, but i’m not sure if it’ll get better as soon as he can program, because i know he wants to work with his hands.

"So I find myself in a bit of a pickle and I’m kind of looking for some kind of reassurance or unbiased guidance.

I’m currently searching the job market for something in aviation/aerospace and so far I have had a few interviews and they all ended up as rejections. My current financial situation is almost perfect for where I currently live, meaning my gross income covers all of my bills and leaves a little left over. I am currently retired military and I’m able to live off of what I make without a current job.

I’m being presented with a couple of job opportunities with an aerospace company in Southern California for a job that I fear I am way underqualified for (I more or less lack the experience it looks like they are asking for on the job posting). I could probably learn some of the aspects but I also have a huge confidence problem. I have the fear that if I were to get hired, I would have to move to an area where the cost of living is literally 300% more than where I am at. I fear that I wont be able to do the job and if I get fired, there is zero chance I can live there.

One factor to consider is it would require me to move to a state (California) that I really do not want to move too. The area in question is heavily liberal/Dem and while I am neither of those, politics don’t run my life, but if I can avoid various area, I do.

The pay for the position is likely to be high enough to where I can save up, but there is also going to be a huge increase in taxes compared to where I live including state, and likely moving up into a higher tax bracket.

My family is admit on me moving back but I really just don’t want to as I am actually happy where I am now. I can’t seem to get them to understand and I know in their minds they’re thinking I’m passing up some great opportunities that also get backed-up with the guilt trip.

I’m just really unsure of what to do. Should I go for it and take a huge risk, or stay put and wait for a separate aerospace company to get back with me where I currently live.",Job prospect requiring huge change and risk,0
"I'm in the process for interviewing for a position that I'm very interested in. I had a phone interview with HR, then a phone interview with the hiring manager, and yesterday afternoon had an in person interview with the hiring manager and 3 others from the company. I learned that this is the finalist interview, and there are 3 candidates (myself included) they're deciding between. 

I did not get business cards from any of the people who interviewed me, and the only email I have is the HR person. I'd like to send a ""Thank you"" message to the team - I took away some good specifics of what their goals are for this role, so I'd like to reiterate that I took note of these goals and how I think I can help address them.

Problem: I don't have any of their email addresses, since I didn't get their business cards.

I emailed a thank you to the HR contact for her help in arranging the interviews, and asked if she would be able to pass along the emails for me to express my gratitude to the people I interviewed with. I asked that if she was not able to provide their emails, that she pass along a thank you memo I wrote. I sent that at 8am this morning - we're now at noon and no response. I'm getting antsy. Should I start looking for a way to reach out with ""thank you""s to the team through another channel? If so, my options are:

1. Guess at their emails. I know how the HR person's email is formatted, so I can assume the team's emails are in the same format since I know their full names. Is this creepy if I suddenly appear in their inbox?
2. Send a message through LinkedIn. I'm not connected with the hiring manager, but I did find her page in researching the role. I could send a thank you message in this way.

Or should I stop being so antsy, assume that the HR person will deliver my message, and just wait for the outcome? I don't know if too many ""thank you""s looks desperate and pushy.","Post-interview ""Thank You"" via LinkedIn?",0

"I need some advice about where to move next in my career. There are some life-changing lucrative opportunities (I believe, could be naive, I'm young) in my current position if I choose to stick around, but I've also potentially gained enough experience here that I could go to a competitor, get paid twice as much, and have 50% of the hassle. I also have a baby on the way, due in March.

Background:

I don't have a degree, any formal training, or experience previous to getting into all this. I started in a small marketing firm of about 10 people. The CEO sort of took me in and mentored me into a web development role. I learned extremely quickly and was completely self-taught. Eventually, I managed the whole team under the CEO. In two years I could build websites and mobile apps that worked really well for clients, and run digital marketing campaigns that generated millions in revenue using PPC and Social Media ads. I met with CEOs of large companies, big-time social influencers, some celebrities even and held my own in negotiations and deals. I wrote my own contracts, managed projects from start to finish almost completely independently except some feedback from the CEO, and a team that'd I'd helped hire and train. We ended up picking up a contract for a reputation management job with a company that provides financial services. Mainly credit card processing, gift cards, eCommerce, etc. They were started in 1999 as a sales office for a much larger processing company. They made a ton of money essentially scamming people when the big EMV compliance push came out in the USA (Chip Cards). They had a call center of 50 people, made calls pretending to be their current merchant services provider, offered them a free terminal that was emv compliant, and hooked a deal with a contract (early termination fee attached) to grow a huge portfolio.

Once the big push for EMV compliance died off, the CEO of that company was left shrugging on what to do next, couldn't just call people and scare them for ""not being compliant"" anymore. Also, he'd tarnished his company's reputation online (go figure) and wanted to hire us to fix it.

The CEO of the marketing firm came in and proposed a different plan, a merger between our two companies with a new vision for both companies as a whole, with a complete rebrand. He wanted a more consistent income and saw an opportunity in combining the two main services we both offered (which there definitely is). This was about 3 years ago.

The vision for the new company was more of a Sales Support organization with a separate branch for software development which I hold a 5% equity piece of, which got a big kickstart investment from the CEO, my previous boss became CTO and essentially president of the company. The separate company I own 5% of has not generated any positive revenue since we started, because everything ended up going through the payments company and got lost in the shuffle you could say as priorities shifted and so is mostly forgotten about as an entity, though it does own certain pieces of our software that is being used.

The CEO outside of some feedback and funding has no involvement in our day-to-day, he really doesn't even know what we're building honestly, he just sees the money rolling in and is fine with it.

The CTO and I have completely redone the company, establishing ethical practices for employees and account acquisition, and building the company into a sales support company for outside sales offices. We've built POS applications to compete with the likes of Square, and Clover, and are doing quite well with that so far, but have a way to go still with our relatively small team.

We've got a huge push coming in January with our new point-of-sale software that is going to take us up a big notch.

The negatives:

The admins here are awful. The CTO is a complete jerk. The CEO isn't involved at all except in funding, and spending the money. I've gotten to know the CTO extremely well over the years. He has some chronic bipolar issues, and is abusive to his family. Some seasons are absolute hell working with him. Other seasons are very profitable and full of growth. He's an excellent idea guy, and salesperson. He doesn't have a lick of current technical knowledge but pretends he does (or thinks he does), then shoulders all the work on me. I'm excellent at implementing ideas, managing projects, and have a good head for current technology trends, but I can't come up with a good idea to save my life if it's not related to something that's already in existence. He's been the Yin to my Yang I will say, plus he took me in and gave me an opportunity when no one else would, so there is some loyalty there for me. His ideas are pretty good, but extremely difficult to implement and he wants everything done yesterday. I know it's like this almost everywhere with software (based on what I read on the internet), but I feel it's dialed up to 11 here.

On top of that, I get paid less than half of what someone in my position would make. Now, I don't have a degree, and I didn't really have experience previous so I get it somewhat. But I've seen the numbers coming in, I manage a lot of that too. The stuff I'm building and contributing to this company has made them tens of millions, and once they do a portfolio buyout will result in hundreds of millions. I was getting paid bonuses which helped balance things out to a more fair wage, so were a lot of the employees but they recently took all those away, so now I'm living paycheck to paycheck. I learned it was because the CEO was squandering our money and there wasn't enough left to go around, plus he implemented an extremely unprofitable sales program. I spent a month under the direction of the CTO running numbers and reports to convince them to stop that program, we'd lost over a million dollars on it in 6 months, and our ROI is 3 YEARS not factoring in attrition. Also, the CEO bought 2 new yachts, a Ferarri, a Porsche, a 3 million dollar mansion, and a private jet. Plus monthly upkeep on these things, all going on as company expense. And his wife goes out and does all her shopping on the company credit card. I learned all this within the last month and it's sickening. I've contributed my last 3 years making this place shine, attempting to implement a good culture, establishing teams, team leaders, managers, designers, developers, and I feel like it's been squandered away and like I've been stabbed in the back.

The CTO just learned a lot of this himself as well and feels similarly but is too wrapped up in it to walk away, and has proposed a plan to essentially take the business that we've established since the merger and form a new company out of that, and previous business will be kept entirely under the CEO. That way insane personal financial decisions made by the CEO won't impact the new business we establish. The plan from there is to reinstitute bonuses, better wages, etc. I've levied for a raise to what I call fair wage for what I do (still less than average), but it won't happen until that's done. That was about 3 weeks ago and nothing has moved on that yet, not even a letter of intent.

The positives:

I love the team and the people here. I love managing them, training them, working with them. Almost everyone here I've directly participated in hiring and training and I've been able to give other young people like myself opportunities for a start where appropriate and it's worked out great!

On top of that, the software we develop is my baby. I've poured so much time blood sweat and tears into this thing with my team and we've made something I'm proud of. The latest version of which will be a real gamechanger in our industry.

I don't feel like I have sufficient experience (5 years of project management essentially with both marketing and software, but I wear so many hats), and no degree for the position I'm in even though I'm doing well enough at it. So just that I get to work here and build this experience and lead this team is something I don't take for granted. I could be back working the sales floor at best buy again for $10/hr. Not that I'm saying I don't recognize that I have developed a lot more skills, but if I started applying elsewhere I don't feel like I'd be taken that seriously with my age and resume despite my accomplishments and knowledge of my industry. It'd be almost starting again from scratch unless someone took a chance on me and looked past my lack of formal education.

Where I'm struggling to decide:

I think you can piece together the dots here. The CEO at every turn has felt like he's tried to run this company into the ground, he's thoughtless with finances, careless, and couldn't care less if everyone here lived on the streets as long as someone was here to pick up the phone.

The CTO, while I consider him a friend and practically like family, is an abusive person when he's on a downswing, which is like every other month. I do feel a considerable amount of loyalty to him for taking me in and giving me the opportunities I wouldn't have had otherwise though.

My pay is abysmal for the work I put in, well over 60hrs a week (salary, no overtime), I'm one emergency away from being in serious financial trouble. It was fine with the bonuses, but I'm just barely making it now, plus I've got a baby coming soon.

Our new software will change things dramatically I believe, but it's going to be a few more months and things are so chaotic right now in light of all the recent financial discoveries that I'm not sure we'll all make it that long. We're not the only company trying to get a product out like we have, it's a race right now and we were way ahead, but now starting to see competitors catch up to what we're doing. I also don't want to abandon what I've built. If I leave, that software would probably not be continued and would just be counted as a loss. I'm guessing 1/2 of the staff would wind up being gone too as they'd scale back to just offering sales support and in-house sales as they'd done before the CTO and I came on board.

If I was going to apply elsewhere for positions I'm looking at the following roles: Product Manager, Project Manager, Producer, Consultant, Business Analyst, Systems Analyst. I feel each of these is appropriate for the experience I have and what I've spent that last 5 years doing.

Sorry for the long post, just have a lot to get off my chest and I feel each piece is relevant to making a decision on how to proceed.","Stick with current company for potentially better opportunity down the road, or apply with competitors for better pay now, and less hassle? Warning: long post",0

"Bear with me because this might be pretty long, but I seriously appreciate anyone taking the time to look at this.

So I am a recent spring college grad who has been having some significant struggles finding a job I actually enjoy doing. I earned a degree in Information Systems and Operations Management but honestly have no clue what jobs to apply that towards.

After finishing up at school I really felt the pressure to find a position to start earning money so I could afford rent and stay in the area. I ended up going with a Staffing Agency that put me in a position as a Server Technician. The pay was way lower than what everyone else had been making, and I kept hearing from all my coworkers that there is almost no way to move up if I did get the full-time position. I had a good time there with the actual coworkers and management was not too bad but the position was a lot more physical moving of servers and equipment around, and eventually, it felt like I was just a glorified warehouseman. After only 2 months in I put in my two weeks, said goodbye to everyone at the company and at the Staffing Agency and moved onto another position I had lined up while working there.

This new job I was super excited about. It was in the Department of Commerce, had decent pay and some good benefits and I was going to be working as a Procurement Specialist which sounded quite interesting to me. However, I made the mistake of not asking what the office would look like in my fever to find something better, and gleefully accepted my first ""real"" job. I am now situated in the sub-basement of the building, with coworkers all 55+ who I struggle to relate with. The workload is practically non-existent, and I have tried to ask my superiors for more but they always come back with ""its just typical this time of year"" as the Fiscal Year just ended. My commute is also terrible for how close I live to DC, and even trying to get mentorship from some of the bosses has been more of a struggle than I had assumed it would be.

I am now reaching a point only a month in where I once again have started to hate what I do. I am always wondering what other stuff I could be doing with my time and have actually started to write a novel to occupy myself as it is that slow. I can stick it out for probably another 3 months or so but after that, I really want to move onto something else that is maybe more local. My question is how bad is this going to look on my resume now that I am moving on from a second job in only just a few short months. I read everywhere how doing that with one job after a couple of months causes you to look like a job hopper, which is causing me to feel as if I am now trapped in a job that I hate even more than the first one I moved on from.

"I graduated from college with an anthropology degree last year and am applying to graduate school in medical anthropology now. I have been working at the same job for a year now. My coworkers and supervisors are great people, but the schedule is getting increasingly time-consuming and inconvenient for me considering 1) my current mental health state and 2) what I plan to do long-term. (It is pretty easy, and there is room for growth if I stay, but it would be rather boring until I get there. I don't plan on staying there for more than 6-8 more months anyway, and if I do get promoted soon, I don't want to just ghost them in a few months.) 

I would like to find another job just to keep making money while I transition from one phase of my life to the next. I live with my family and pay $350 on rent and a little less than that on student loans each month. 

Some limitations: 

* I live in a suburb, the bus is my only method of transportation, and the commute to and from the closest major city where I currently work is 1 hour in the morning. It's slightly less if I travel at other times of the day. My usual work shift is 1-9pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and 4-8pm on Sundays. I also take a GRE prep class on Sundays from 9am-2pm. (Fridays and Saturdays are girlfriend time.) 

* I have a bachelor's degree and am concerned about being considered ""overqualified"" for certain positions. 

* I am physically disabled and can't do strenuous physical activity besides *occasional* lifting and regular office tasks. (In other words, no warehouse work.) 

* I want to emphasize planning for grad school, so I am looking for a more part-time or flexible schedule, or the possibility of working from home. 

Some more positive things about me: 

* I have a lot of writing and editing experience under my belt from undergrad. I've presented and published independent research, edited a zine and a journal, and tutored both undergrads and high school students. 

* My current job is in survey research related to healthcare, so I get to interact with people on the phone every day. I also have some previous customer service experience working at a tech support desk in college. 

* The research projects I work on are pretty diverse, so I've had exposure to studies on dementia, opioid use, cancer, genetic testing, exercise, and more. I'm not an expert on any of these by any means, but I might be able to leverage some of this. 

Some jobs I've thought about: 

* Tutoring, online or in person

* Working at a cannabis rec shop (I do not really use cannabis, but my undergraduate research was on the topic, and I live in King County, WA so there are a lot of stores here) 

* Library jobs might be nice and quiet

"I have worked in clinical/biotech labs since 2014, Company 1 was Oct 2014-June 2017 and Company 2 was June 2017-August 2019. I am in my 3rd biotech company now for 2 months and I am not a big fan. I interviewed for a ""tech"" position, got offered ""specialist"" position, which is the next step up from a tech. 2 or 3 weeks in, there was a team meeting where it was announced there will be a restructuring and 3 of the 4 other techs in the dept would get promoted to specialist. The job description I signed for Specialist included some stuff I wanted to do regarding data analysis, metrics, investigations and deviations, implementing LIMS, writing SOPs, etc. Specialist JD now since restructuring is a step back - all those duties I wanted moved to Data Management role, which is not my title (the other specialist got the data management role).

"Hi y'all need some advice so here's the deal!

I applied for this course through a university that's SUPER competitive and luckily I got in under the circumstances that I have a clinic and someone who is licensed is willing to train me, so I can apply for my license. I asked the clinic a month before applying and they said I could, and gave me a trainer's information. At first I thought I didn't get in because I hadn't gotten an approval letter on time, so I emailed the clinic director telling her I wasn't sure, but then emailed immediately after I found out I did get in to tell her I jumped the gun (I rarely make professional mistakes like this and i'm so upset I did). During the 2 weeks after applying they had established a contract with the clinic so they are responding to the university about me. Just to confirm that it's still happening and my trainer has agreed, I've emailed and called twice in the past week and no one has gotten back to me. The director even told me to call and email her to talk about the  start date.

This is all a mess I'm sorry lol.

I was wondering, should I wait for a response or should I go in to talk to someone because I don't know what's going on and my licensing depends on this entire internship.

"I had the best interview of my life last month. 

I’m currently in a major career shift, and this position straddles where I am and where I want to be: it heavily relies on the skills and experience I have but offers entry level training on where I want to go.

I also really sold it. I had a lot of positive feedback from the panel, including tears from one and a “that was the best answer I’ve ever heard in an interview” from another. 

Here’s the rub:

I’m in school for this career shift. My current, low-paying non-union job has an incredible boss who works with my class schedule every semester so that I’m still pulling full-time hours and getting all them sweet benefits. 

The position I was officially interviewing for is for the smaller satellite branch with less flexible hours. 

We ended on the note that it was more appropriate that I be considered for the more fast-paced branch here at the “head office.” This branch is open 24/7 (Night shift is my jam), so there is tons more flexibility in the available schedule. 

The interview then switched to a conversation about what hours I could work and what my schedule would look like. We ended on a note of” you are an amazing candidate. You are the second person we have interviewed, but we want you on board. We have to talk to the union and find out how and if we can manipulate the schedule in such a way that we can bring you on. It will take a while.”

I haven’t heard anything since.

"Hello everyone,

I'm a semi-recent college grad (graduated \~1 year ago) that got a health science degree and intended to enter the healthcare industry. Turns out I didn't like it, and instead I've decided I want to pursue an entry-level IT job. My resume concerns me because it has gaps in it (needed to handle a family emergency), and has mostly unrelated experience (took whatever I could get to pay the bills...food service, landscaping, etc).

I tried my best to tailor what I can offer to appear fitting for an entry-level IT job. While I don't have professional IT/Tech experience, I at least have some personal experience building and troubleshooting computers. I am just starting to learn programming, and I am working towards a CompTIA A+ certification--things I can't quite put prominently on a resume yet.

"I had graduated with a bachelor's in electrical engineering 3 years ago, but due to unforseen personal life struggles, I'm only now entering into the industrial industry. With my time out of school I knew I would have a hard time jumping right into an engineering position, so I decided to take the service technician route to help rebuild a foundation and eventually work my way into an engineering/design role. It also seemed a great way to set me apart from other engineers by having the hands-on experience and understanding the end-user experience - to then bring those perspectives into the design work later in my career. A lot of people I've networked with have been encouraging of my approach and agree with my career path.

So I'm now in my first week as a service technician for industrial equipment and I initially am feeling somewhat out of my element. I was not given much shop experience from my father or family, as no one in my family had much experience either. And I went to school for electrical engineering, which is largely done on paper/simulation save for learning how to use electrical test equipment. I am currently of the feeling that I lack the mechanical aptitude, as well as the experience with tools. 

However, there are plenty of shop guys that seem to welcome the extra set of hands and are willing to show me a few things. I'm doing my best to learn as much as I can from the shop guys and from the other service members when we go out on a job. I am still soaking in all I can, but I'm still very new to it all, so I'm not sure what questions I should be asking.

My largest concern, is how long until I feel confident in doing this job? This is my first time in an industrial setting and it's been a tad overwhelming at first. My other concerns are what red flags should I watch out for when starting a new career at a company? (things like lack of training, feedback, or set expectations are what worry me)

All in all, I'm glad I took the leap into this position, no matter the outcome I'll definitely be learning a lot about myself and what work would fit me best. And I know to just give it time, it's be nice to hear some other similar stories becuase I know I'm not alone in ever having felt these feelings.","Starting my career: technician to engineer, thoughts and concerns",0

I had a 20 minutes call scheduled with HR where I was given the offer.

"I’ve been searching for a new job in retail or sales since February of this year and admittedly have had a few interviews but did not get the positions.

Feedback was I came across as well spoken and articulate but they found a better fit for their company etc.

I had a group interview for a local supermarket literally two days ago and when I arrived I did not expect there to be so many people!

There were easily over 60 applicants and we were all in a room with upper management so about 75 people easy.

I have done group interviews and they usually didn’t phase me too much but for some reason when I got up to speak in front of the whole room I literally froze and you could tell I was very nervous as I was shaking.

I did manage to utter out what I wanted to get across but I feel being so nervous blew my chances of landing the job.

I do have anxiety but have worked on it so it was very unexpected.

"Hey Everyone!

I am finishing up a continuing education masters program and I've been applying around for jobs for the past few months. I want to finish my program while working. I have been working hard to apply for jobs that only require the education and experience that I currently have.

"Hi I've been working at this job for around 2 months now and am really struggling to force myself to wake up and go. I was initially hired as a salesman however the boss quickly added new tasks to my job. The company is extremely short-staffed and I was being told to make deliveries, take photos, answer phone calls, heavy labour and just overall being a type of office assistant. This increased workload is really tiring me out and when I tried talking about my salary the boss got really angry and tried dodging the question. I do full-time uni and currently work 3 days a week. However due to the increased workload and relatively average pay I was wondering if it worth staying at the job or just quitting and hopefully find another job later on? I'm only 18 and live with my parents, so I really don't need to work at the moment. I just don't know if it's my laziness or the job is really stressing me out. What are my options?",Not sure If I should stay or quit?,0

*TL;DR at the bottom.*

I'm having a hard time managing my rational response to some crap at work and it's been lingering for a while now.

Sam and I work at the same company - I'm a project manager and Sam is a specialist in an area that provides support to the whole company. Sams' reputation precedes her, but turned out to be pretty accurate after just a few months of working together. Sam is difficult to work with, lacks attention to detail (in a detail-oriented role) and has become condescending and rude towards me and my team.

I'm in charge of a big project at work; I do big projects like this a few times a year, so nothing out of the ordinary for me except I have less support than I usually would have due to staffing reductions, so I asked Sam to help in her area of expertise.

Think of me as her client, but working within the same company - I ordered a product from her to spec that I have to pay for. She went from being somewhat pleasant to being downright rude and condescending when I politely, but firmly, pushed back on the product design when it wasn't what I asked for. After some back and forth and her refusal to take any of our feedback, I told her we'd find someone else to do the job if she wouldn't (my boss was in full support) and she responded that she was doing it anyways without our approval and she'd bill us later for it. My boss told me to let Sam screw it up, we'd deal with it later.

As the project moves forward, it's become really clear that Sam is just plain lazy. She's had a number of public facing screw ups in her area of expertise, we have to spend time double checking everything she does and we're already redoing a bunch of her work that's gone out publicly to thousands of people because it was wrong. Her mistakes reflect poorly on my team because we're the face of the project. My boss is aware and isn't impressed either, but Sam doesn't report to her. Boss has plans to talk to Sam's boss, but I'm not confident anything will come of that conversation.

Sam's condescending attitude and speaking down to me because she's the ""specialist"" is what's nagging at me. I've known for a while that she's not a specialist at all. She's just someone who was handed a job because her father worked for the company and demanded a job for her. As far as I'm concerned, if you get handed a job and you can show up and can excel at it, you've earned that job. But she's just plain bad at what she does; I don't have any respect for her or the work she does at this point. I'll always be professional and practice civility. I don't have to like or respect you, but you don't need to know that.

This whole thing is weighing on me. I take a lot of pride in my work and presenting a polished final project and her pushy, condescending attitude and sloppy work are making it harder for me to do that. I turned the other cheek when she became rude and condescending with me, but I really wish I'd told her that I didn't appreciate her attitude towards me and that I deserved some respect as her peer and the person managing the project. It sounds easy writing it here, but I didn't have the balls to put those very words into an email and hit send. I'm up for a promotion and while I fully deserve it and I've earned it, I don't want to do anything to jeopardize it in the heat of the moment.

I WANT to let this junk go. I WANT to move on and stop thinking about this, but the entire thing just grinds my gears. I can move on and focus on other things at work, but as the project is ongoing, she pops up at least once or twice a day - and with each pop up comes an air of condescension riddled with more mistakes and it just irks me more and more.

How do I let all of this roll off my back and stop caring about her crappy work? How do I continue to deal with this coworker as the project continues without letting her under my skin? I need to build up a thicker skin to junk like this, how do I do that in a professional way?

TL;DR: ""Specialist"" coworker is refusing to listen to my/my project teams wants and needs, is being condescending towards me and is putting out sloppy work that reflects badly on my team. Regret not telling her off in the moment, but can't seem to let it go as it drags on.",Difficult Coworker and Letting it Go,0
"Hello, right now I'm \[24\] attending college, but money is needed at home and I'm thinking about looking for a job (even a min wage job is ok) to help with the family financial necessities.

"I have worked in my industry for almost 10 years, always been a salaried employee working 9-5 and pretty happy where I worked. Recently my husband and I moved to a new area so I had to find a new job, I saw the position I'm in now and jumped on it. I needed a job and they seemed desperate for an employee, the pay was good and I was told it was the standard 9-5 as most workplaces are. And plenty of work to go around. I have a lot of appointments with the VA. I told them about this when they offered me the job. I always make an effort to make them after 3 or before 8. So I never miss that much work and if I do it's not more then 3-4 hours every 2 weeks. I've been working here for months and getting great reviews from all the leadership. 

But suddenly this past 2 weeks I have gotten nothing but toxic and snarky comments from the leadership directed at me. Suddenly questioning if I had completed tasks I had already completed or wondering why I was leaving at 5 instead of later. This turned into them asking me if I could work 8-5. I know this isn't out of the ordinary for some employers at all but it was the way they asked me. As if I wasn't getting my work done when I was completing all the work by the deadlines.  And it wasn't what they originally told me. I told them I can do 8-5 but it may change some days because of my appointments. They said thats fine and to just let them know when they were. I continued to do this and then got a very almost threating to fire me email yesterday morning from my CFO. 

Saying that he doesn't see a constant work effort from me and that I should be putting in just as many hours as him, But I'm not even putting in 40 some weeks. Not only is he the CFO, which I think has a VERY different array of job responsibilities than my job. But I always hit at least 40 hours unless I have my appointments. Which I explained to him. He then ghosted me and pretty much acted like we never had that conversation. 

Then this morning, among all the snarky emails in my inbox questioning if I had completed tasks that I have already completed weeks ago. Was an email from him that says if I have an appointment I need to make sure to work those extra hours in the next day. So if I leave at 3 I'm expected to stay until 7 tomorrow? The office doesn't even stay open that late. The earliest I can come in is 730, which with my commute isn't happening. So I'm left wondering what they expect of me? I'm a salaried employee who makes the salary even if I come in for 10 minutes and then leave. So I cant take PTO for my appointments unless I was gone for a whole day. So I can't use my PTO but I also can't make up these hours some weeks. I'm just wondering what I'm left with here? I've been applying for new jobs ever since I started getting those prying emails 2 weeks ago. No bites yet, and I don't want to quit this job if I don't have to, it pays well and isn't a bad gig.

"For about a year I’ve tried relentlessly to get hired by a major airline in my city but I can’t even get a phone interview much less an in-person interview. I have a few friends who work for the company and I’ve asked them for insights on how they got their job and they didn’t have half as hard of time as I seem to be having. They all got their positions straight out of college with essentially no experience and have been able to work their way up.

"I’ve recently started a new job and realized a week ago that it just isn’t going to work out. I took it on because I was recently laid off when my previous store closed permanently and took the first job offer I was given because I was uneasy about being unemployed for too long. I’ve realized I’m heavily overqualified compared to my coworkers, my manager is extremely under qualified, and she micromanages poorly and aggressively. On top of that my manager speaks very basic English (foreign based company and she was hired after recently immigrating because she’s friends of the owners family) so I can’t even have a conversation with her about my grievances, she understands very little outside of basic statements. 

I’ve come to the conclusion I have to leave without giving notice for the sake of my sanity but I’m extremely anxious about doing so. I’m in the position where I can just leave this job off my resume as it will be very short lived, so I’m not really concerned about any backlash on that end. Part of me wants to not show up, but I’ll feel horrible for my coworkers that have to pick up the slack, the place is incredibly understaffed as they can’t keep people on, for obvious reasons. I feel like my the only route is to tell my manager I won’t be returning the following day to at least give her time to staff accordingly the following day or come up with a game plan.

I have no clue how to go about this or what to say. I’ve never been fired from a job and every other job I’ve left I have given more than two weeks notice and left on extremely great terms.

Should I just give them the standard 2 weeks or should I do 3? 

So I have about a month and a half left but am trying to decide how much notice to give my employer. I only say 3 because my position is specialized and only one other person in my department does it so it’d be a lot to handle for one person, and I feel like an extra week would give them some more time to find a replacement? But then again, I keep thinking that it’s not my problem. 

I’m also have a bit of anxiety about giving my notice and having my last day be November 22, the week before thanksgiving. I work in an industry where thanksgiving is one of our busiest weeks of the year. My boss doesn’t let anyone have off this week but I really want the week to see friends and family and get all my stuff packed up.

I've been in the real estate industry since senior year in high school (2011), worked through college, and shortly after graduation I became licensed as a real estate broker and opened up my own small business/brokerage. The last 2+ years I've spent growing/working/managing the business and it is at a stable point now where I can take a step back and explore other opportunities, while still being able to manage.

I'm 26 years old and I would like to utilize the degree that took me years of effort to achieve, as well as work for a company with a social network of other young, intelligent individuals. I think having a social network is very important, especially in the beginning stages of my professional life. Question is, should I focus more-so on relevant coursework &amp; skills learned in college on my resume (which may be a tad more difficult to do considering I haven't touched the material since graduating), or would it be more advantageous to try and relate the skills I have acquired through my work experience to the jobs I am applying for (also ""difficult"" because the fields and work done is different)?

Maybe this is all in my head, but my aim is to make it clear on the resume that I have the required educational background to perform the necessary job functions even though I took a less traditional route after graduating. My concern is that hiring managers will see my work history and decide, based on that alone, that I am not a good fit. I will be reviewing my coursework for any technical questions I may be asked, but from what I hear, entry level position interviews are typically more behavioral since employers understand the lack of work experience. I'm just in a weird place where hard skill accumulation is limited during college, and hard skills gathered from my previous work history have to be manipulated to relate to these positions and may or may not be viewed as applicable. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I make this next step in my life.

"I've been getting coached and micro managed constantly at my current job. This all started when a few minor (or so I thought)  internal details were missed by me. After this happened, I had a few informal meetings with my manager about ""what's going on?"". I went on to explain that the volume of work coming in is impacting the quality of my work as I can only do so much in a day (this is a very small office btw). I mentioned that I try to be as detail-oriented as I can without impacting the deadlines of my projects and tasks. It's at the point where I can't afford to be as detail-oriented, as I would like to be, because there is so much to do. I try to organize everything on my plate and my list is usually very long, most of the time I even skip an hour of lunch break to finish my work in time.

I caught my manager rolling their eyes when they asked me a question that I needed to look in my insane email inbox to find an answer to. It's funny because this manager has always given me weird vibes ever since I started this job. It almost feels like all of my work is magnified x10 compared to my coworkers. It just seems like no matter how hard I try, I'm never up to their standards.

I sent out an email with the job posting to my references asking if it was okay to send their name and email along. So far I've heard from one and I'm waiting on the other.

"I got let go from my job in March 2018 after working in that position for a year. Before that I had been in various accounting positions for over six years.

I was not a good fit and on top of that the supervisor did not seem to like me after I made a mistake on the first 6 months of the job.

So after 2 months of not getting anywhere in my job search, mostly due to people wanting me to have more of an accounting degree (I graduated with a BBA in Finance) I decided to go back to school to get my remaining 30 hours to be CPA eligible. I decided to do it full time as I only had a little over a year to complete it and did not see a point in dragging it out over 3/4 years like some people.

I went to school and lived with my parents as they offered to let me live with them so I would stop draining my savings, and I graduated with a 3.4 GPA this past Summer. I felt so proud of myself as this was the first time I have ever done this well in school. I became CPA-eligible this past August. 

I figured with the good grades and constant networking, things would improve from the prior year.

Well it's been roughly four months since I graduated and I have submitted well over a 100 applications and been on over half a dozen job interviews and I am still unemployed. I feel like I am nowhere closer to having a job than I did when I was let go over a year and a half ago. 

It's just so frustrating to feel like before I was not getting a job because I did not have a bachelor's in accounting, or enough upper level courses in accounting, and now it's because I have been out of a job too long (that is my assumption).

My parents, understandably, are losing their patience. My Mom actually screamed at me this morning how they can't move because I am holding things up. 

I'm honestly feeling like a complete failure. My Sisters and friends lives seem to be getting better and I feel like I am worse off than I was when I graduated college in the heart of the recession.

Some people are telling me to just pass one or more sections of the CPA exam and then the jobs will line up. Well, by then I might be two years out of a job. Who is going to want to hire me then?

I've considered getting my server's license and start waiting tables even though I feel like that is not a good use of the all time I put into school and I do not have any server's experience.

I've often wondered if my prior employer has been putting out negative things about me or if I made a bad impression at another job which has blacklisted me from everything.

I live in a very difficult job market. I searched for my current job for 9 months. Sadly, after training I realized a lot of what was promised to me was a lie to get me through the door. I have been looking for new employment for the last 6 months, albeit a bit sporadically.

"I've encountered a situation that has me scratching my head a little bit.  Was wondering what you all might think of it.

I took on work as a contractor for a large company in a different city with a higher cost of living.   Said contract was under a year with a few perks extended to me due to special circumstances.

When one of the perks for relocating were set to expire, almost halfway through I was offered the opportunity to continue the work back in my home city.    I did so and have been working there for a few months.

I learned that the company planned to bring on 4 or 5 people in my same exact role, and they were using my resume as the archetype for the job search (I originally learned this when two separate recruiters called me about this same job.   
 This was confirmed by my managers).     About a week later management brought up the topic of contract renewal.

I am being offered a new contract doing the same exact job, but at a lower rate.  It is a 28% cut in pay.   It was implied that the change in locale was part of the calculus for the lower rate.  I was explicitly told that the rate they were offering was higher than what would be offered for the contractors they plan to bring in.

What I suspect is that a few other things are at play.  I got a bit of a sweetheart deal originally due to connections I have at this company.  They are apparently very cost sensitive because they made inquiries over my 3 or 4 hours of overtime over the course of two weeks.

"I started my job in early December of last year. Before hiring me (an out of state applicant) the position was open for 1.5 years.

I have worked hard and received positive reviews and two raises. I love my job. I love it more than any job I have ever done and would do it until the day I die. It challenges me, it gives me an opportunity to grow career wise and I like who I work with. 

My SO lives in another city, 2.5 hours/190 miles from the one where I currently live. He has a pretty specialized field for our region and there is not a job for him in my town (only 14k people in my city).

I do accounting, which is all handled from my current office. We do not have any remote positions in our department. 

My plan was to ask for the opportunity to do a split remote schedule. I would work one week in the new city at the local office and then do a four day week in my current office. By doing this, I would just book a hotel for three nights every other week. I've thought of the logistics for getting some of my day to day stuff done and have a plan for that. I plan on using the fact that my position was open so long and the work I've done rehabbing as a reason to allow me to do this kind of schedule. I like to think I can handle this conversation with professionalism, but I know I am prone to crying. Just thinking about having to ""let him down"" when I tell him I'm leaving makes me tear up.

"Hi r/jobs,

My girlfriend and I are currently saving to travel for around six-months in just over a year from now. I'm currently miserable at my job, so I will have zero issues leaving. However, my major concern is leaving my job, travelling, and coming back to a whole lot of nothing. The idea of not leaving my job, especially to travel and do what truly makes me happy, terrifies me more than the prospect of returning to nothing. So regardless, I'm going to do this thing.

I'm currently 28-years old, I've been working in Marketing / Communications for a number of years, and I have three degrees. I would say I have a decent amount of experience and haven't had many issues finding work in the past. But, I know not all offices/organizations look at long-term travel the same.

But, I don't want to be oblivious to the realities that come with leaving a job. So my questions are -- especially if anyone has done the same -- how does it look when you return back? Did hiring managers give you a hard time? Did you have trouble finding a new job? Do you regret it?",Planning to leave my job to travel for six-months. How does that look when reapplying to jobs later on?,0
"As a job seeker, I often come across positions advertised online that do not include a salary range. Or sometimes one job site will list one salary range, while others will have significantly different salary ranges (Indeed vs Simply Hired vs Glassdoor vs Idealist).

My question is, what is the most professional way to handle this situation?  My interview with company B will be the first interview so it is by no means a for sure thing.

"Hi all! This forum has been super helpful as I have been job searching.


I received a job offer this morning and believe I will be accepting the position. I have an interview tomorrow and a second round set up for Friday in addition to a phone interview on Thursday.


This offer is for a company that I was really excited to work for and in a great location. The second round interview is probably my number 2 choice since the location is not as ideal. The other interviews are not the best fit for the next steps in my career.


There isn't set date for accepting the offer, but I understand that it is best to respond within a week. 


My question is should I cancel these interviews since I want to accept this offer? I think this is the best move but I don't have anyone to ask advice, so I wanted to double check that I am respectful to all companies and not burning bridges!

"To make a long story short, I'm quitting my current job in Southern California because it is unbelievably toxic and my coworkers treat me awful, my boss is lazy and puts all her work on me.. the list could go on. I'm moving to Salt Lake City, UT with my boyfriend (It's gorgeous there, I fell in love immediately and i've never been happier with a decision to move.)   
My current job is in broadcasting/radio. The industry runs in my family and my dad is a huge bigwig in it. I have a connection in SLC with a BIG broadcasting company there (100x bigger than my current job) and the position is higher up, pays better, and is RIGHT up my alley. i loved it.   
I applied, my dad even put in a good work, and they emailed me back for an interview. Unfortunately, the only times they were available to do the interview was.. while im at work.. so I schedule it for my lunch break and had to sit in the empty conference room of my current job with the door closed and do the phone interview. The interviewer was so nice, he sounded young and very kind. we hit it off fast. but he kept throwing curveball questions at me and i think i was nervous and stressed about SITTING at my current job doing this interview that i am scared i answered them inappropriately or that they were a test and I failed...

most of the questions were super great.. ""why do you want this position"" ""what makes you think you're a good fit"" talking about my current job and what i do... my experience... etc etc.. we even joked about why I'd leave southern California and go to Utah of all places. But then he said ""did you look at our websites?"" and i said ""yes!"" which i did, of course, but it wasn't like i studied them.. i just looked at them.. navigated around.. moved on.. maybe 10 minutes bfore the interview. anyway, so he asks if i looked at them, i said yes, an dhis next question was ""is there anything you would change? what would you suggest we do?"" and.. surely this was a test to see my creativity but i panicked and the last thing i want to do in an interview is critique my interviewer's work! so i said ""i think it looks great! i love this this this and this"" etc. but i definitely, in my mind, have suggestions for it. but i was too nervous to say them!

and another thing, he said ""how much are you looking for pay?"" and i was always told not to say specific numbers i want. so i said ""I would like to work full time."" and he paused, and i hesitated and nervously asked ""do you mean numbers?"" and he said ""yes"" so i told him ""im honestly happy with 30k"" and i just felt so juvenile and scared and nervous. going into this position i was nervous i am too young for it. im 21, and it's for a promotions coordinator. so when i said that i just felt like i absolutely failed. the rest of the interview i was so nervous that i kept messing up.. that i continued to keep messing up. did i screw this up royally? he even asked if i had any questions, i said no. his parting words were that he gave me his number, email, and asked when i could start, and that they will be making a decision this week. 

i ended the interview by shooting him an email thanking him for his time and consideration and.. that's that. i guess i'll know this week but.. i cant stop thinking about how much i screwed up my dream job.",nervous I messed up on my interview.... I need some input and reassurance,0
"Before I got my current job I was job hunting for over 9 months. I finally accepted and offer for $16 and hour as an admin clerk in contracts for an aerospace company. At around 6 months I had a performance review and was recommended by my boss to apply for a planner position. I interviewed and I’m still waiting to find out, but I do know they only interviewed 4 people. It was awkward as heck because I somewhat worked with the three interviewers. It sounded positive from what I’ve heard, but I’m still weary due to all the rejections from my initial job search. If I don’t get it I will definitely go to school. 

Before I knew about this opportunity I had applied to a local private university and planned on finishing my BBA using my GI bill. Well, I’ve now been accepted and had 70 units transfer from classes I had been taking online. I got my Associates in Business before I got out of the military and was about to get a Bachelors but I got my job and put it off. I have always wanted to go to a real school because I feel like a fraud with my current education, not because I feel as though I didn’t learn enough but because of the stigma I associate with online classes. Before this new job opportunity going back to school made sense because I would make more using my GI Bill than I would if I continued to work. But if I get this new job I think it could be a $5-$10 increase in pay. Glassdoor says it’s about $25/hr, idk how accurate that is. Our HR manager has been in and out so I haven’t been able to ask. 

I’m 24 and I think it would take about a year to finish a BBA, I was working on a finance concentration previously but now that I have experienced the civilian side of things I cannot see myself in any finance position. I would chose marketing if I do go back..

Career wise I know how hard it is to find a job and I’m thankful I have one, but would I find better opportunities if I go to a real school and try internships or work part time with my current 5+ years experience?

I'm 25 with a masters in library science, so I'm still early into my career but I honestly don't have that much direction. I was incredibly unhappy at my last job due to the industry and type of work, so I only know that I don't want to be doing that anymore.

Company A is a more creative market research position. I would be working on a small team with someone with a similar background who has really made a name for him/herself in the industry. But I don't know if I'm that interested in the industry. I enjoy writing and analyzing things, but I don't know if I want the position based on a gut feeling and some negative feedback from previous employees (employees being expected to work longer without any raises etc.) overall it seems like a good opportunity but I don't know if it's a good opportunity for me in particular. This position would be more challenging and could potentially lead to better opportunities (that I don't know if I want). 

I also would feel guilty not taking it because the interview process at company A has been going on for so long (1.5 months) and I would feel like I wasted their time and flaked out. 

Company B is a little less interesting: executive search. I would get to use my research skills that I enjoy, but there would not be a real creative outlet like company A. However, this company has a lot more going for it: better benefits, good work/life balance, nice people, opportunities to work with different teams based on career interests, and so on. Company B has also been a fast whirlwind interview experience and I don't know if that's a red flag or shows decisiveness. Like company A, I am not particularly interested in company B's industry. I am not sure if I would be taking a job that's easier with good benefits, but ultimately wouldn't be ""impressive"" enough to peers.

"So I work for a big IT company that has an odd policy when it comes to money. Salaries for new hires are very appealing and competitive to bring people in, even if they come fresh out of college. How ever, adjustments and raises once inside are very small for the few people that get them, even if you are a top performer or got a big promotion. One of the VPs literally told me once that ""Our company knows there are higher salaries out there and we won't play the game of retaining people with money. We assume people will leave and we will replace them""

This creates situations where you have inexperienced junior programmers earning more than seniors, among others.

Anyways, I recently hired a senior developer for my team and since I'm his manager, I'm able to see that his salary is considerably higher than mine, around 25% more.

It's important to point out he is a bit older than me and has a few more years of experience. How ever, I have a much bigger workload and of course greater responsibilities.

I've been thinking about raising this concern with my boss, but for the most part I know his hands are tied as this policy comes all the way from the top.

"At the interview at a fintech company I was asked when I could start working for them. Since, I don't have a job at the moment, my answer was ""immediately"". They moved forward with me, and the HR lady asked me about my earliest start date. Since I want to finish some coursework I'm doing right now, I answered that i could start Monday in two weeks, which is 28th of October. 

I'm not a US citizen (I'm coming from Europe, this will be my first job in the US) and the notification period for leaving a job can be 1 to 3 months, so switching jobs typically does not take place under a month. 

Assuming that the company would have to do some paperwork and some internal setups, I assumed that two weeks would be a reasonable time frame. But now I'm concerned that my answer ""immediately"" and my gap of two weeks could be misinterpreted by the company. The whole interview process with them was quite quickly, so I guess they are a fast-moving company.

I know that the notification period for leaving a job in the US is typically two weeks and I'm wondering if that results in a ""switching time"" of two weeks.

"I apologise if this comes out of a wall of text or as an information dump but I really would like to hear from others on this.

I just graduated this July with a First Class with honours in Mechanical Engineering. its been 6 Months since my finals ended and over a year since my placement ended and I have been applying for a full time position. Since 14th August 2018, I have applied for atleast 500+ positions if not more, I have been entertained and even head hunted at times, I have even secured interviews with some companies, both local (in the UK) and worldwide like Exxon Mobile and Shell for example, Yet everytime the question of sponsorship comes out I am immediately shafted.

I am not from the UK, I hold a passport from the third world and I quite literally do not have a place to call home as I do not have anyone or any place for myself from the country my passport is from and my parents are in a very poor situation themselves in the Middle East. My entire drive and objective in university was to secure success and to emigrate to the first world and I have completely failed at that now.

I am moving back to my parents in two weeks and they have absolutely no one they can contact regarding helping me getting a job secured. On top of that, my dad encourages me to just take any job and work it, but looking at him and how his career played out, I am afraid of making that same mistake he did and getting stuck in a loop with poor pay and no future opportunities because I strayed away from my career due to shortsightedness. I have already worked as an engineer and I am afraid that if I go away from the field for too long or work another field then no one would want to hire me at all, especially internationally, let alone locally. Is this a good idea to just go and work anything?

I have also checked my CV with many professionals in industry, people who work in HR, recruiters and the universities career department so I know my CV isnt the problem because I do get entertained. My dad does insist however on paying for a CV service from Ireland he contacts through whatsapp but I cant see this being worth the money. Would you all recommend this?

I am also really not looking forward to the Middle East as the pay is quite poor and they can be quiet unfair with employee pay and treatment.

My goal at the end of the day is to leave and migrate to Canada or Europe (Vienna, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark are my choices to name a few) and I did want to do a masters to move to these countries but money is a huge issue right now.

On top of all of this, I have had a rough year, I have lost family, I have had alot of financial issues, I have had a rough breakup (not even fought, she just decided to pretend it never happened anymore and has pulled a few moves on me like plan a trip and then stand me up, but its fine because her friends are there to support her and im here by myself) Ive had heartbreak and worst of all, ive lost hope that ill ever get a job and/or be successful or achieve the things I have shed blood sweat and tears for since I was 17. Meanwhile people like my ex and most of my highschool friends are travelling, enjoying lives, getting jobs very easily, getting married and I am just stuck here, failing.

"This probably comes out as venting, but let me know if you have any suggestions:

Hi, I am an engineer have been in the same company for 15 years. About 5 years back I moved from one department to another. The first project was slow, directionless and had a very non-committal/passive project leader. When that project was terminated I found other jobs, including one in the neighboring departments. It was not easy, but I knew the people. I took this job because I knew the people and had good relationship.

My new boss is a good person, but very aggressive. I also had a colleague whom I came to know very well. He was about 5 years senior to me. I thought ""great.. this is the best place"". After about 6 months, I realized that I was being treated as a technician (after being a sr. engineer). I sucked it up and stayed on. On many occasions the relationship with my colleague was very symbiotic and it worked well for the project.

Of late, my colleague started doing a few things that are affecting my work a)Poaching a new contractor b)Pushing another contractor on my project without consulting me (I told him, its not OK and this was very tough for me to say) c)pulling this contractor away for his project without consulting me, d)starting a parallel effort replicating some of my work using the guy he poached. This colleague has about 5 years more experience than me, but is not my manager. I talked to him once when this happened and he said ""he didn't mean it"" and never said sorry. One instance above happened after I talked to him. Since then he has been very reticent.

Edit: I talked to my boss and he was surprised. But he kind of indicated that I misinterpreted things and my colleague was ""result oriented"". But, I insisted that the misinterpretation can happen a few times, but now it is a pattern. He was concerned and bothered. 

I am feeling very discouraged/disheartened and the place feels toxic because of such things. I talked to my boss and he was surprised to learn, as I never let him know earlier infractions.

"Currently I'm unemployed. I interviewed today with Company A and they called me saying they were planning to send me an offer of employment by tomorrow. I said that was great and thanked them but have not formally accepted the offer yet.

I still have an interview scheduled with Company B on Friday. 

I looked up some reviews online and the ones for Company A are pretty mixed. It's apparently a fairly good place for entry level workers in my field, and the company has a fun, young atmosphere, but many of the reviews added that the work is repetitive and that upper management is a ""boys' club"" and generally not very efficient. This matches my experience - the interviews were a little odd (both times they seemed extremely bored with the conversation despite quickly accepting my application soon after; the man at my second interview also made a handful of joking-but-slightly-snarky comments about my portfolio), and their starting salary is pretty low (about $3k less than what I asked for, and $6k less than I was making at my previous job).

Company B only has a few reviews on Glassdoor but they're all five stars (maybe that's suspicious too, I don't know. Company A's reviews are highly mixed and the 'good ones' sound a little defensive).

"I'm 27 and I just started a new job (supply chain/project management field) that I don't think is the right fit for me anymore. At my previous company, the job was super easy (also logistics but more order management), chill coworkers and office, 4 weeks PTO, never had to do any meetings or conference calls. The only thing I didn't really like was that it was hourly. And the pay was about $19/hr. There also wasn't much room to grow or move around. One of the upper manager can be strict sometimes but I never really interacted with her.

I was not looking but a recruiter reached out to me about the new job I have now. It is salary and about 30% increase in pay. The work was what I used to do at another company, and I knew it would be more work than at my previous job. I took the opportunity as a new challenge but now I miss my old job and feeling some regret. First, the company is very small and sometimes I am the only one in the office. I didn't think about this before accepting but this means that I have some office manager duties such as checking mail, be in charge of the keys and locking the office, ordering supplies, some cleaning...so basically I have to do my main job plus the extra duties as I didn't think about how small the office would be. This wasn't in the main job description but w/e. My previous company was bigger so I didn't worry about having to do all that.

Some other cons of this new job: frequent conference calls which I hate. I am overwhelmed with all the information and nothing seems organized, I don't feel like I'll ever fully get it? I feel underqualified. The person that's also doing this started 5 years ago and created all the processes. But the processes aren't organized. Only 2 weeks PTO which is meh. I don't think work-life balance is as great as my old job. Since my old job was hourly, we were just require to show up for 8 hours and leave. Commute is not better or worse. Another thing is that I am lonely. Sometimes it's just me in an empty office all day. Again these are just some things I didn't think about til I quit :( ...

"I got fired from a small company for performance issues. I was not producing the level of quality they expected of me. I believe the pattern of poor performance has a lot to do with the level of disorganization and lack of support in the company, but the issues that lead to my firing were unquestionably my mistakes. I had a direct manager who I had a very good rapport with, and who agreed to be a positive reference in a job search while I was still working at the company. While she is the one who did the actual firing, I believe my department head (who I did not get along with) was the one who ultimately pushed for the firing.

My question is this: What do I stand to lose by asking my direct manager if she could provide me with a positive reference?

"Hey all,

I'm going to try to keep my story short:

I graduated with a degree in Environmental Science in August 2019. I landed my first job in December of 2019 and quickly realized that my (then) boss lied about the job and what it entailed. It was a government call center, and my boss also turned out to be emotionally abusive to all of the staff. I started looking for jobs after my 3rd month.

I stayed until June of 2019, (6 months) when I was hired as a teacher in a charter school, teaching my degree subject area to middle schoolers. However, I have again found myself in a toxic work environment. Multiple teachers have already left, and there is no support when it comes to discipline issues. On top of that, teaching is exhausting, and I'm dealing with most first-year teacher issues with no formal training.

I am currently seeing a therapist, but my mental health is taking a hit. I want to try and stick it out for the full school year (until June 2020), but at this point, I'm not sure if I'll make it. In theory, if I quit my current teaching position, I know that I'd be seen as a job hopper, and I'd have an extremely hard time finding a new, good position.

Would there be hope for me to find something stable after two jobs in a year, or would it forever damage my future career/resume? Has anyone done this and found success?

"The issue is I have no idea why. I think a part of it could be shyness and jobs like assertive people (sometimes I can fake it). At one of my first jobs I was sitting at a front desk (which is not the kind of work I like) and I was even getting blamed for things I didn’t do and some female employees came up to my manager about me not smiling enough. So I was literally getting scolded for not smiling (like that’s supposed to help?).  Also my friends and family have all said I come across friendly. Even when I worked on fake smiling, some days I would be extremely tired and couldn’t help feeling exhausted and then some women would walk by and tell my manager I looked vacant (when I never spoke to them). Also, all of the people were females and I’m considered attractive, so I wonder if ThAt makes a difference. This was a really uncomfortable experience and the people there were very strange and gossiping too, so I learned not to talk to them about what was going on with my work life.

The next job it was just for coming late and the guy I worked for was old and disorganized and always rolling his eyes at me for weird reasons. They told me it was no other reason other than coming late but who knows?

My last job they said it was performance issues but the managers there were very lazy and had no idea what I was doing at my job (it was a disorganized startup).

The company that was working for us is still fixing their jobs on the machinery because the machinery is too old and my boss keeps pushing me to ask for it to be fixed rather than investing in new equipment.

Also, he keeps asking me to make colorant dispersion formulas that are the same (or better) than a big company that develops colorant dispersions... I am the only person working in this project (I+D of the colorants) and working quality control as well for the inks department and I believe it is impossible for me to achieve those results by myself with the equipment we have... I wish he’d be more realistic because I have given him better formulas, just not international company level good formulas.

My boss has been putting me on the spot by blasting mails, on which he says I’m not doing a good job or enough and copies a lot of the other employees... I feel sad, stressed and under appreciated. I do my best but it pains me listening to my boss tell me every day it is not enough and that he regrets giving me the raise because I don’t deserve it (i really need it because I need to support myself). He blames me saying we don’t sell enough because my formulas are not good enough (my formulas are better than the ones they had before and those sold a lot, so I understand my job is doing well)...

I’ve been applying to other companies day and night desperately because I cannot handle the stress. I need some advice on what to do or what to say to my boss because I can’t handle this and I cannot quit or I’ll end up jobless.

I want to know how I could defend myself letting him know I am working but that his expectations are to high for what the company has to offer (machinery, personell and product wise) and that even though it´s not the same as the company he wants to compete with that I have given him better results.

TL;DR: My boss understands I’m not working because my research results are not the same as the international level company we rival when I’m the only one working on this project.","My boss requests me to achieve unrealistic results, how can I confront him?",0
"I work as a home health aide. I work with people with developmental and physical disabilities who need assistance with daily tasks.. however, I don't think what my client is requesting is related to the work I'm supposed to be doing for him.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I drive my client around to different stores and farm stands in the area for produce. I don't mind doing this, but I figure while we're out and about it wouldn't be a big deal if I picked up something for lunch (Fast food or a salad somewhere) to take back to his house and eat. My client gets upset about this and acts as if it's a big deal, while we're already out and I am paying out of pocket for the gas that I'm using to drive him around. I don't get reimbursed. I have made that clear to him. Also, when we are driving he doesn't allow me to use my GPS (because he ""knows"" the way) and when I have opened **my own** window while driving **my ow**n car he tells me ""***You shouldn't really have the windows down""***, I'm sorry, but this is **my car** and when **I'm not being reimbursed** for my mileage and paying out of pocket to drive you around I will do what I want in my car. If we were in his home it would be a different story.. but it's my car and it isn't posing a threat to him to have a window cracked.
2. Speaking of windows.. I am required to do some light house cleaning. I don't mind doing this, in fact, I enjoy it as I get away from him for a little while. However, he has recently requested that I install ***window insulation*** on all of his windows. I don't know if that is considered light house cleaning. And I'm not sure if I feel comfortable doing it. He has 5x4 foot windows and wants me to move heavy furniture to be able to access them. This is what he wants me to do: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=79&amp;v=KLYBqe54Mco)
3. He confronted me about using my phone. I could understand this if I were looking at my phone all day while I'm with him. It would be warranted.. but the other day he spent **2 hours** monologuing about all kinds of things. For 2 hours straight I listened attentively. ***From 9 AM when I started until after 11 AM***, around this time I quickly looked at my phone to check the time and he confronted me. He told me that I look at my phone ""all the time"", in his words: *""you look at that a lot, you were on it a lot while we were talking""* ***""now we don't have time to go to the gym""***. This is not because I was on my phone but because he spent two hours talking.
4. Additionally - I work with him for 8 hours a day from 9 until 5. I am very diligent in my work and I don't dilly dally around, I like to get things done. I do dishes when I see them, I clean the bathroom, the bedroom, I have a system.. so I usually have downtime at the end of the day (About 30-45 minutes). I've been on my feet for nearly 8 hours with no ""real break""s. He is usually on his computer playing chess or watching movies so I figure he wouldn't mind if I caught up on some business stuff on my computer. I have a few side businesses and I am also studying. I don't use the internet or check social media while at work, I wouldn't do that. I am very career-minded and most of my downtime even at home is focused on growing my businesses and studying (I'm finishing a degree next semester). He has a problem with this. He says, in his words: ""***My kitchen table isn't a home office""***  
He has pried and asked me what I'm doing, has asked what it's for, what I'm working on, what kind of businesses I run.. things that I don't feel comfortable talking to him about. I don't like people to pry into my personal life. And when I said that it's my ""personal business"" He laughed and asked, kind of rudely, ***""Well is it business or personal??""*** He almost mockingly asks me if I ***actually*** make any money doing what I'm doing. He is very passive-aggressive, and recently confronted me about bringing my computer. He said it's weird that I took it with when we went to his doctors appointments (did he just expect me to wait in the waiting room for him twiddling my thumbs with nothing to do??), his exact words were *""Do you want to get away from the machine a little bit, put that away for a little while, give that a rest?”* After I had only been working on it for about 5 or 10 minutes, and I had already completed all the tasks he had requested of me. ***He has gone so far as to ask me to not even have it in my bag!!*** Even if I don't use it in his home, he's asked me to not carry my own belongings.  
**\*\*\*\*\*\***And it's especially clear that my side work is not getting in the way of this job because ***yesterday I did not bring my laptop*** and did not get out my phone and I still got done early. I addressed him and told him I was finished with what he had asked me to do and if I asked if there was anything else I could do for him. He said no, and that he was pretty tired and was going to take a nap. He went upstairs and I tidied up a bit but I still had **2 hours** left to do ***NOTHING*** but sit there by myself. Everything was finished. What would have been the issue if I had brought my laptop to be proactive in those 2 hours??!
5. I'm not sure about this one, I could just be a little paranoid.. but I think he might read my text messages/look at my computer screen at what I'm writing. The reason why I think this might be the case is because I will be reading/writing something and go away from my computer or phone for a bit (usually to go to the bathroom) and leave it open. Later on he will mention something related to what I had been writing or reading about. **For example:** I had been writing a script for a video about my weight loss and some of the supplements I had taken during my weight loss. I mentioned magnesium and ***not 20 minutes later*** he was asking me if magnesium was good for weight loss. It freaks me out and honestly makes me feel a little unsafe/uneasy. What else might he be trying to look at on my phone/computer?!

Am I being petty? Is my client just difficult or is something amiss here?? Should I grin and bear it or talk to me supervisor?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I know I don't like him as a person.. we are not compatible personality-wise. I am very quiet and determined, he is a big talker and a bit of a dilly-dallier. He talks about himself nonstop, and has literally even told me that ***he doesn't like hearing about the aides lives. He doesn't care about their lives.*** He has an air of entitlement.. he has never once thanked me for anything I have done while there. My other clients are all very humble and thankful for the service. He acts as if he's entitled to treat me like a slave. He never even thanked me for spending my money on him. I told him I'm not reimbursed and so I am doing it of my own accord. Can't even thank me for that. Very entitled. But I like the hours that I'm getting with him, I just wish they weren't with **HIM**. I would rather work longer hours with other clients but they don't need the hours. He's actually using the service so he doesn't have to go into a nursing home. There is an aide with him from the organization that I work for **almost** 24/7. I really think he needs to be in a nursing home and it's his pride that's keeping him from doing so.",What can I do about a rude/entitled client that is most likely abusing my services?,0
"My dad keeps telling me it’s pointless to just apply to jobs online and that I should be ‘knocking on doors’ and introducing myself and handing out my resume. Most jobs I apply to are posted online (w online application forms) and/or explicitly say to send a resume to an email address. Sometimes they’ll even firmly insist NOT to call/visit without being invited.

But for the ones that don’t explicitly say so, is it worth physically going in to give my resume/introduce myself? Or would I be shooting myself in the foot?

My dads a very successful doctor and says that in his practice they’re old-fashioned and delete almost all email/online applications, and he seems to think that’s absolutely what everyone else does. Maybe there’s some truth to that but on the whole, I think he’s behind the times.

**Edit:** I have a bachelors in English/creative writing from Rhode Island college, and I’m studying online for a certificate in grant writing from virgins tech, and I’m a continuing education/certificate program animation student at RISD (Animation is the dream job I’m really working hard to get, unlike what my dad thinks of it).

I am a very creative person and work well independently though I can also work in a team. I have skills/experience in writing, data entry, community outreach, event planning, program coordinating, editing, graphic design, Spanish (tho not fully bilingual I can get by in a conversation and my reading/writing skills in Spanish are stronger), sales, education, working with teens, networking, secretary work, taking information over the phone, home visits, at-risk youth, low-income communities, cultural sensitivity, Microsoft Office, and Google Drive.

I’ve worked as a grant-writing intern at a local nonprofit helping local low-income Latino residents, then a secretary assistant/cleaning person at my church and a seasonal team member at target (mostly clothes, sometimes cashier).

After that I worked a year and 3 months with Americorps VISTA and created an adolescent peer health ambassador program, teaming up with local nonprofits and health professionals of all sorts to teach our members about healthy living in a less academic environment and more importantly to give them the skills to live a healthy life (nutrition, sexual health, etc). I also helped write and edit a 50+ page community health plan for the city that outlines information and statistics of the current well-being and health trends of city residents (lead poisoning, housing, pregnancy rates, exercise, mood disorders, etc) and offers solutions and plans to improve these areas. I edited not only the written content but the cover and visuals of it as well, and my name is credited in this book, which as I understand has since been given to the local fire department and nearby cities so they can perhaps create their own.

Then I was a community outreach worker and reached out to everyone in the city that had a drug overdose in the past year (by phone call and/or home visit) and worked with them to get any services they need, whether it’s for recovery or a dentist or whatever they need. During this time I wrote a short paper about drug use trends in this city which was accepted to present at this years American Public Health Association Annual Meeting &amp; Expo. This job was for two months because of the grant, though I will be going to that expo in November.

Most recently I was an Outreach Associate at Oak Street Health, a primary care clinic for adults on Medicare. I was essentially a salesman, going to senior centers and local events, spreading the word and trying to recruit new patients. We’d often use raffle prizes to get ppl interested. Then I would call and/or visit any leads I had. We were supposed to call them every two weeks and maintain some relationship until the clinic opens in November (I started in June). All my other jobs I left (because they were temporary positions) on good terms but this is the first job I’ve been fired from, though my supervisor did offer to serve as a reference for me. She was rly nice and helpful and did her best to help and guide me but we both agreed I just couldn’t keep up. I have autism (among other things) and I realized quickly that to work in sales you need every skill that autism impacts. The job was so stressful it was giving me nightmares but it had decent benefits so I stayed. Eventually I was fired because I couldn’t meet my quotas and a lot of little mistakes (forgetting to bring the paint for an activity, generally being awkward, forgetting my ID, tardiness to outside events) added up, although my boss did recognize my effort and that I was so desperate to succeed. And I wasn’t completely useless, I did a lot of graphic design for the team, I was very friendly with and empathetic to potential clients (which was especially helpful with low-income communities and communities of color) and able to find something to relate to them with (whether it’s as simple as having the same horoscope or as heavy as having a disability). Many of my leads told me how kind and fun I was and I used those skills as best I could, something my boss recognized and was proud of me for.

"Hi all and apologies in advance if formatting is shitty (I'm on mobile). 
So three weeks ago I started a job as a support worker and go to visit clients in their houses. The clients that my employer provides support for live all over the metro area and the city that I live in is quite spread out. I have been assigned a 3 hour shift in an suburb that would take me nearly the same amount of time to drive there and back from. I also won't get reimbursed for kilometres I do while travelling there and back (only the kilometres I do as part of the 3 hours). It's also probably worth noting that if the client cancels support with insufficient notice, I don't get paid for the full 3 hours I was assigned... even if I've already made the 1 hour and a bit journey to the client's house. 
I don't want to do this shift for the reasons that it's way too far for me to go for only a 3 hour shift.

"I was unemployed for 16 months after leaving my first job out of college.

It felt like every month of that time period, I'd discover a new rock bottom.  My parents were kinda supporting me when they remembered and I was too embarassed to ask out right, so I'm gonna be honest there were days where I didn't eat.

I'd run out of things like toothpaste, soap, sugar. During the tail end of that 16 months I was completely *desperate*.

I was applying for anything. Literally anything, even jobs I was severely overqualified for (or so I thought). In my mind, that means I have a higher chance of being accepted. Looking back now, now that I did get a low paying dead end job before getting an appropriate one, I know the hidden pitfalls of looking or settling for a job-I'm-only-doing-so-I-can-pay-rent.


*1. Looking for a job IS a full-time job*

It might not be obvious, but job hunting is a full time job. It requires you to invest hours on checking ads, filling dozens of applications a day, checking your emails almost hourly, being available to be called (recruiters rarely call back), going to multiple levels of interview that each takes half a day...

And most importantly, they all happen within the regular office hours. If you take on a job that makes you unavailable during those times, you'll significantly decrease your chances of finding a better job.

*2. Looking for a low-paying job is not easier*

I was rejected about 23 times from job that doesn't even require a degree. Why? Those jobs aren't interested that I have a degree, they want someone that could do the job. Yes, the dreaded word, *experience*..

Yes so I have a degree in accounting but do I have a clue about how to be a seamstress assistant? Or a bakery personnel? 

For these places, your overqualificiation means nothing. They want someone that's done this before.

And hunting for these jobs require the same amount of time and effort, honestly.

*3. Once you do a job once, that's all they'll ever offer you*

People that have worked in call centers, serving crews, secretaries, and the like knows what I am talking about. 

I worked for a call center and no matter what position I was applying for, I always get reverted back to ""Well, you applied to be a data analyst/bookeper/accountant but I see you have experience in phone calls, we actually have an opening for---""

No.

 Mr. Recruiter, you see, I am applying here so I can *quit* that type of job.

Accepting a job that youre overqualified for achors you to that level. I am gonna say that not having any experience at all is better than having experience in a low-paying poaition that has nothing to do with your degree, if youre young.

"I worked for a corporate pediatric dental office for 6 years. I was the manager for the last 3. I know it’s cliche but the staff was my family. When working hand in hand 10 hours a day you become close. Anyway. I disagreed with a doctor and how he was treating staff there. I tried to speak with him about it, he refused. I brought it to my regional manager for help. During that time the doc was writing to our president saying really vicious things about me and I ended up being fired in May. It was and is still an extreme shock. 

Flash forward to July. I get hired at an insurance company. My sister in law put in a good word for me as she is a manager in a different department within the company. I have anxiety every single day thinking of going to work. My jobs went from one end of the spectrum to the other. At the dental practice it was fun, a team effort, a lot of communication. At this new job I am alone in a cubicle, it is repetitive, no one talks, I put head phones in for 8 hours a day. 

Two girls I worked with at the dental office are now with another doc I used to work with and the doc has been asking about me. I feel like I’d be a lot more comfortable and happy there but I won’t have the opportunity to move with in the company or be as financially stable due to it being a newer office. But I do believe it will be a successful practice and the doctor will be a great boss.

"I'm applying for a job and they want a writing sample. The job is a writer for one of those story based mobile apps, so I assume they want a sample of my creative writing (they asked for a relevant sample, so I assume that's what they mean). I have never done a writing sample before, but I looked online and learned that I basically just submit two pages of a relevant piece with a paragraph for context. However, I have a few questions...

Right now, I have a short summary at the top, and my writing sample beneath, so it basically looks like this:

Is this the correct way to submit a writing sample? I'm not applying by email, so I have to give context in the actual writing sample itself.

Another question I have is about the margins. My samples are using custom margins set for novels (top/bottom 1"", left/right 0.65), but I printed it out just to see how it reads on paper, and of course it threw the dimensions off. Should I make my margins normal (top/bottom/left/right all 1"") and just size the font up so it looks better so if they print it, everything still looks nice? I don't know if there's many writers out there, but the ""normal"" settings basically means if you print the pages out, they fill the whole page. My current margins make it so the writing is the actual size of a novel, but printed onto a full sized piece of paper.

"I am a young female who currently works as a ""Customer Service Specialist"" for a small telecom company but will be moving to the NYC area in a little over a year once my boyfriend finishes school. I put Customer Service Specialist in quotes but my job is just a small portion of Customer Service whereas we focus a lot on Project Management, Sales, provisioning, porting, and billing. I am looking to get out of the Customer Service type of position once we move and have really enjoyed the Project Management aspects of my role. I have a Bachelor's Degree and think the title of my position will weakens my resume and chances about getting out of the Customer Service type jobs. I have a great relationship with the company and they do not know I plan on leaving and don't want to get any ideas in their head to ruin my current reputation, but I do plan on giving them about a months notice in advance.
 
My family has been encouraging me to ask for a raise since my job duties have expanded since I took the position and we've gotten more added to our responsibilities. Should I ask for a job title change and ask for a raise together? How do you ask for a raise and what is a good % to aim for?

The title change is more so I could change it on my resume, is that too superficial? Is there anything I should put my resume to strengthen the work that I do to express it's not just some minimum wage Customer Service job? Does anyone have suggestions on Project Management courses or certifications I could do while I have time before leaving? How do I leave Customer Service?

"My colleagues show up early/stay late/come in on weekends to catch up on work. I tried coming in late one time when I started the job, sent an email that got time stamped really late at night, and got called into a meeting where I was asked if I was overwhelmed. I was not overwhelmed. I just like putting in extra hours sometimes—especially when the space isn’t busy with people. I feel like my boss has arbitrary rules for me/things and that anything I do could get criticized. Moreover, they have a visceral aversion and unreasonably angry reaction to anyone—including superiors—asking questions, despite the fact that they themselves ask tons of questions. (Personality disorder, perhaps?)

Right now, we’re at a critical point where we have a lot of projects coming due. I’d like to go in this weekend to just work on stuff and make sure I’m ahead of the game and any deadlines. But I’m worried my manager will find out and start accusing me of being overwhelmed. They mentioned payroll and that they can’t pay us for the extra hours, which seemed reasonable, and maybe they only mentioned the workload part to seem less self-interested. (It might seem more kind to ask if you’re overburdening someone than to tell them to not work as much, so as to not have to pay them more money.) In this case, though, I’m not interested in submitting a timecard with more hours. All this said, in the broader scheme, I feel like from the start they have they used any opportunity possible to make anything I do problematic and an indictment on me and my work.

"A company asked me in for an interview for a position I had interviewed for already several months ago. I was initially rejected but the boss liked me and asked me in for a position with a different manager.

The interview went well and HR called me afterwards saying there was positive feedback but they were in a hiring freeze likely till the end of next month.

I got an update call a week after the interview saying I’m still the top candidate, the role is something they want to get started with asap - but due to the hiring freeze, cannot offer yet.

The end of the month comes and HR calls saying the hiring freeze is lifted, you are still top candidate, no one else has been interviewed, but due to company processes she cannot offer yet. “Hopefully, I’ll get in touch with you next week with an offer.”

That was two weeks ago with no contact. I sent an email a few days ago with no response. I’m planning to call on Monday.

As of today, it has been a little over 2 months since my interview and I’m quite frustrated. I’m wondering if I’m just being lead on with this “top candidate” stuff. The woman from HR is very hard to get hold of which doesn’t help.

"Last week I started a new retail job. The store just opened up and it’s much different than I expected. When I was interviewed last month I was upfront with the manager that this was my third job and that I was only looking for about 2 days a week. The manager seems to forget this every day and I reminded him at least 4 times about this since we started and each time he seems very surprised. He keeps asking ‘’So you really can’t work any other days than this’’ as if I mislead him somehow.

I work 7 days a week and I was just looking for a few hours extra on the side and he has me on 24 hours a week. I tried to ask if I could work less and he firmly said, ‘’No, you’re going to work 8 hours a day’’ (Even though most people at my job work 5-6) . 

On top of that the schedule is decided about a day or two before we come in each day. We still don’t even have a weekly schedule. On top of that sometimes they will change our schedules less than 12 hours before we come in without telling us because we have to use an app.

I am exhausted and in pain from being on my feet all day every day. Maybe it’s my fault for taking on too much but I really needed the extra money.

I think the hardest part is this is across the street from where I currently work so I don’t want to make anything awkward if I quit. I just feel incredibly stupid for putting myself in this situation.

I don’t even know how to quit. I feel like if I just say ‘’This job isn’t what I expected’’ or ‘’This job isn’t for me’’ they will try to talk me out of quitting or get angry.

I also feel bad because they’re just starting up and I don’t want to leave them short handed because I feel like even if I give 2 weeks notice that won’t be enough time for them to find someone and replace me.

"Yesterday, I interviewed for a position at this non-profit and was given a verbal offer later the same day. I said I was flattered, but asked for some time to think about it and now have 2 days before talking to HR again and asking for a written offer.

From the interview, I learned that the position would give me tons of experience related to my public health major and many opportunities to develop a plethora of skills (e.g. community outreach, public speaking, case management, graphic design, etc). Also, the non-profit is well known so I would be getting the advantage of saying I worked there and building connections from my job. It helps that the commute is only a 15 minute drive from my place. 

However, I’m worried I may not have the grit to constantly juggle so many responsibilities. This could be imposter syndrome early at work though. The job requires me to work 1 night/week and 3-4 Saturdays/month. However, the employee leaving mentioned they’ve worked several evenings a week. Is this the norm for the non-profit sector? Based on the manager’s comments, not only would I be responsible for carrying out duties that were listed on the job posting, but also working on things that weren’t listed to help the team. Work/life balance is one of my biggest values, but I’d be sacrificing it working here. It’s an exempt salary position for $30k-$32k. I’m not sure of benefits because I forgot to ask, but will inquire with HR.

I got the impression that this may be a disorganized, but hardworking place to work at. HR seems to be constantly swamped with work and everyone I saw looked neutral or tired. I’m not sure if the people here are overworked or if that’s just the nature of the job, working for this organization, and/or expected from the non-profit sector. I’ve always wanted to work at a non-profit after volunteering at several and agreeing with their philosophy. 

The person I’d be replacing said I’d have to practice good time management skills, advocate for myself, enforce boundaries, and explained that the job essentially involves me chasing other people down. The manager is new (has only worked there for 3 months) and said that other people have left, so I may have to take on additional responsibilities. Both the former employee and the manager said they have yet to determine how I would be trained. Despite all of that, they reassured me that clear communication is possible if I speak up for myself and ask for help. They’re aware it’s a steep learning curve to get used to.

"Hi all.

I'm currently working in a retail job position, and have been with my company for 2 and a half months. At my interview, my boss was interviewing me and said that I would very likely be promoted to a keyholder within a few weeks of working to compensate for a manager leaving soon after.

Time went on, and any time I brought up the position or my interest in it, she would say that she was still working on it or trying to make sure they had the resources for my training. Seems legitimate, right?

About two or three weeks ago, I brought my friend in to apply for a job there because we're short staffed. We had four employees before hiring her, and now we're up to five: my boss, my manager, me, and two other coworkers in the same position (one of which is my friend). Within four shifts at my job, my friend had already been offered and begun training on the keyholder position.

I asked my boss why I wasn't getting the promotion, and what was holding me back. She said that I had problems with being late--which is understandable, given that I've run late to a few of my shifts because of circumstances out of my control--and that my uniform shirt was wrinkly. What?

Now I thought that things would be okay once my manager told me that my boss had told her that I'd be getting the keyholder promotion around the holiday season. ...Then that promotion was being pushed until February of next year. I was starting to get pretty mad.

Today, my friend informed me that she was talking with my boss about the keyholder position. My friend told her that she wasn't sure about taking the position due to ""added stress and feeling there are people more qualified for the job than her."" My boss immediately commented that there was something going on between my friend and I. My friend denied this. My boss then told her, directly, ""If you don't take this keyholder position, I'll hire someone else."" 

What can I do about this? Is my boss in the wrong? What should I do?

"So, a little background.

I have been working at my current company (a tech startup) for a little over a year, and it's the first real job I've ever had. The mentorship from my manager has been incredible, my team is like my family, and I was able to move into a senior position within the first 6 months. I can say I'm genuinely happy to go in every single day and see everyone. The work itself is a weird mix between customer success and operations, but it's also not too shabby. 

However, a month or so ago, I started to feel like I had stagnated and capped out on what else I could do there. I still loved seeing my friends, but I felt a bit restless. I wasn't actively looking for a job, but I had a recruiter reach out to me from a much larger company on LinkedIn. I decided to give the interview process a try, and after a very long, 2.5 hour interview, I found out yesterday that I got the job and that they were very impressed with my skills in general.

My snap reaction was excitement, but it quickly moved to a feeling of deep anxiety; can I really take on all of the responsibilities of this job?

"I was flown out to a 5 person panel interview.  This is after completing a phone screen with the company recruiter, a Skype interview with 2 VPs (one would be my boss) and a personality profile.  It’s for a senior role in a Fortune 500.  5 person panel was conducted in 2 stages:  first stage was with company President and the CFO.  Second stage was with VP HR, and 2 other people on the senior leadership team.  Interview was about 3 hours.

At the end of it, the VP HR openly stated he had concerns with how I left my last job.  I was let go as part of a restructuring and received a significant settlement after hiring a lawyer.  However, as part of that settlement, I can’t disclose any details about the settlement or circumstances that led up to it.  I explained this.  It was wrongful termination which the company classified as a restructuring, even though my role was not eliminated, I was just replaced.  It was a personality conflict with new leadership, VP HR believes I was ‘caught on something’ and terminated as a result.  I couldn’t provide any more details to defend myself and this is a pretty damning point of view for the HR guy to have.

Aside from that, I hit it out of the park with everyone else.

How much influence is this VP of HR going to have?  Aside from that line of questioning, I had solid answers to all of his questions. My understanding is that the hiring manager makes the call and takes ‘input’ from HR.

"I'm quitting my job of 5 months in a startup. Honestly I just took this job because it was the first, best offer after I got laid off from my previous company. My team and coworkers have been pretty friendly. My manager, who was newly hired a month ago seems like a decent dude, he's been very nice to me (he gave me a gift card for my birthday shortly after he joined, I believe out of his own pocket).

The main issue is I don't like the founders/upper management who are control freaks, don't trust anyone to do their jobs - traits I've had negative experiences with in a previous job. I also don't believe in the company's product and ability to grow as they've been treading water for the past 5 years and have only now received series A funding (they've had a VERY rocky history with employees, with a hire and fire culture).

Long story short I accepted a new job in a bigger company, that pays 9% more and has a better job title. There is NO turning back now and I'll be putting in my 2 weeks on Monday.

The problem is there's lots of work to do in my department and there are only 2 other people in it. All of this is in my manager's hands, and upper management has some pretty clear, lofty goals for this guy (or, based on history, I guess he'll get the axe if he doesn't meet them by Q1 2020).

I'm not sure how much weight a reference from a 5 month stint holds, but I'd really like to maintain good ties with a lot of people from this company for that.

"sorry this ended up being so long and rambly. 

here's the tl;dr version: 

i've been depressed for a while but have just been 'getting on with it'. i changed jobs recently hoping the change might help but it did the opposite, i feel worse than ever. i want to leave my job asap, i need to give 4 weeks notice, i have 2 weeks leave to use and i've got a med cert for next week. what should i do? i don't care about burning bridges as i have other references i can use, i'll only use them if future employer want a reference from the most recent job.

i guess i've been depressed for a long time but i have just been dealing with it by not actually dealing with it and have been managing other than the occasional really low day. i changed job about six months ago hoping it might help give me some motivation/positivity. It's a complete change from what i did before and since the training at the beginning, then my first day on the floor, i had a feeling it wasn't going to be the job for me. It's a highly stressful job and i've felt like i'm barely hanging on since the very start. this on top of the depression got too much and i finally started seeing a counsellor. 

I have had no disciplinary issues and am actually performing well, but at great expense to my mental health. the work itself is fine but the workload and deadlines are overwhelming. i constantly feel stressed, i often work late (even though most other staff don't bother), i sleep poorly often waking up in the middle of the night panicked about work, i can't relax and enjoy my days off because i'm just anxious about going back. i have told my manager about feeling stressed/overwhelmed and they just said 'oh some stress is good, it's just about learning to manage it better and managing your workload/priorities better, come see me if you're feeling overwhelmed' which i have done however it's always only a temporary fix for that day as i'm still getting increased workloads anyway.

it's also an unpleasant environment to be in, my whole team is stressed, i haven't really made friends because everyone's so busy no one really talks to each other. we don't feel supported by our manager who is very stats driven. every time i've emailed them regarding anything not directly related to work/stats, it's ignored; such as letting them know about leaving early for medical appointments, giving plenty of heads up about leave i want to take, requesting an ergonomic assessment as i was experiencing physical discomfort..etc. i always have to follow up by physically going over to their desk later, then they're like oh i'm not ignoring you while desperately going through their inbox looking for my email to read what i wrote. while they've never been explicitly awful towards me, the passive aggressiveness is really draining.

anyway it all came to a head this week when i took a mental health day on monday (my first day off since i started), but actually got sick; went in the next day anyway because i was stressed about the work build up from the day off; worked late tues/wed to catch up; noticed more work put in my list on thurs and asked about it and they were like oh yes you're due for a workload increase i was just about to email you about it; in these 3 days i went in clearly still sick, never once did they suggest i should go home if i'm still not well; then i had an unrelated minor traffic incident thursday night and had to wait an hour and a half for assistance to come and didn't get home until 12.30.

so i took friday off too. when i went to the local clinic to get a medical cert, the GP was really attentive and seemed to genuinely care about my mental wellbeing. and everything just boiled over. she wrote me a medical cert for next week off too and said to go back and see her at the end of next week for a review and she'd be happy to write me another for the following week if i need. and when i emailed the med cert through to work, you guessed it, no acknowledgement!! 

i had already decided a little while ago i wanted to leave this job and relocate to another city where the rest of my family are, to be closer to them. but i was going to stick it out a bit longer. however after this week i just want to be finished with the job already and go be with them as soon as possible. i can't bear the thought of going back to this job, it gives me anxiety just thinking about it. 

my contract says i have to give 4 weeks notice. i have 2 weeks leave accumulated. i'm thinking of sending in my resignation next week while i'm still on sick leave, then i'll use my 2 weeks annual after that but that's only 3 weeks and i'm not sure what to do. or can i say 4 week's notice, 1st week's already covered by my med cert, i'll use my leave for weeks 3-4 and i'll just get another med cert for the 2nd week when i see the doctor next week?

i've always worked out my proper notice periods in the past as i've never been in this situation before. i'm not sure what to do and i'm stressing about it. i'm meant to be using this week to relax and rest and work on trying to feel better but instead i'm worried about this. 

how much do i tell them? do i say it's stress related or just say i'm relocating for family/personal reasons? i'm still in my probation period for a few weeks if that makes any difference?

please help, any advice will be much appreciated!

"A bit background: I started my job less than a year ago, and I think I undersold myself when negotiating the compensation package. Most of people in my group have higher title, even those with much less experience. So I assume they receive higher compensation. I went to my boss and asked for a promotion. He agrees since I've been performing above expectation, but he asked me to wait until after my first year. I'm cool with that, so all good.

"Hi, I'm a fresh graduate who recently started a 2-year rotational program. I will be staying with my current department and team for 1 year, but 2 months has passed and I'm already having thoughts of getting transferred to another team because 1) Everyone in the team is too busy to mentor a new hire; and 2) I'm stuck in between the conflict of two coworkers who are mentoring me atm

Currently, our team has a lot of meetings, too many meetings IMO; everyday they have impromptu meetings called by the bosses from the main office outside my country; some of my teammates work OT to finish work they haven't done due to the meetings

As for how I am caught in between my mentors' conflict, I tried my best to discuss briefly what happened:

\- Aug to early Sep*:* Did HR onboarding activities for the 1st week, 2nd week was endorsed to my team; manager assigned Person A to be my buddy. Person A was really nice to me, if not, one of the nicest people to me, but the team have some troubles with him in terms of behavior (he's an expat) but he might just be having culture shocks. I didn't do much during this time since the equipment which I need to use for my project is down.

\- Mid Sep:  Equipment got repaired. Manager noticed that I was being idle so he told Person B to give me tasks (basically Person B became my pseudo-buddy for 2 weeks; also, Person B doesn't really like Person A). Person B is hands-on, but he isn't really a good mentor (like he accompanies me to the production line then proceeds to just chatting with the people there and not really teach me how stuff works; I had to ask people how to do stuff) 

\- End of Sep: the team had a meeting to formalize my project. Manager said that Person A would be my buddy and I would be heavily working alongside him in his project

\- Oct 1st week: Manager asked me about how Person A as a buddy and if he was giving me tasks for the week (and I replied that I'm fine with him as my buddy and that he has given me a few tasks). He mentioned that he might alter again my project since in his perspective Person A is not performing well (manager wanted Person A to prioritize his project and improve his performance).

\- This week: Manager told me that Person B would be my official buddy (not sure if starting next week); however, I should not tell Person A that he will not be my buddy anymore. Right now, I'm working on both Persons A &amp; B's respective activities and this puts me in a lot more stress since I'm doing double of my workload. I'm trying to reach out to my manager about this but then he's too busy with all of the meetings

Idk if things would still get better but I really feel like being part of my current team is stunting my growth and learning in this company and in my career, that's why I'm considering maybe a new set of team who is less busy than my current team would change my outlook on the company, (also casually looking for jobs online). How do I address my desire to transfer teams to HR? Or are there other ways of me to deal with this dilemma?

"Hey everyone, bear with me as this is pretty long, but I could use some advice:

This is my first job out of college, and have been there for about 3 months. I work as an analyst.

Much of my work over the past 3 months has been learning how the company works and taking on more of the work and regular reports/projects my team has to do. I’ve either taken many things on fully or help a lot with others.

The past month, my boss has been dumping more and more things on me, and when month end comes around, its just too much too do. It still takes me a while to do many of the reports because I’m still learning how to do them. But it seems like my boss expects the impossible.

I spent the past week working my tail off the entire day every day to finish reports and projects due for month end this week. However, yesterday something came up that was due. My boss had told me it needed to be done two days before, and when I finished it yesterday, he said I should have done it a week ago. He claimed it was done too last minute and was poorly done. This was the first I heard about it.

He was pissed and went through this whole spiel about how it should’ve been done way in advance and planned for me to do it ahead of time next month and walked me through it like I was a baby. I was pretty pissed off, but got over it today.

Then, in a meeting this morning with my boss going over the main project I had been working on most of this week, he says “oh yeah how is [insert another project I didn’t know about] coming along?”. I had never been told it needed to be done or was due this friday. The lift for this new report was huge and couldn’t possibly have been done by me this week. 

I did as much as I could, but I had already planned to leave early for vacation this weekend, which he said was okay. I sent it in, and then before leaving for my trip asked him if I needed to do anything else. He says “[report that was supposed to be done today] needs a lot of work, but we’ll just have to do it”. And then passive aggressively told me to have a good weekend.

"I'm 17, I dropped out of high school, then kicked out of my family, so I will need to get a job soon. The problem is most job applications require at least being 18yo and a high school graduate.

I did not drop out because I was being stupid and carefree. I have now found something I want to do in the future (long term goals) but my high school is a special high school that is funded by government (from tax-payers money) that requires us to take only specific fields in college, or else we'd have to pay large sums of money (bound by a contract signed by parents and me). Unless of course you drop out due to failing grades. It would be unfair to make someone pay for being stupid. 

So, I did fail my subjects, while pursuing relevant subjects for my goals. Originally, I planned to switch to a regular high school with no limitations, but unfortunately, my parents weren't open to explanations. They no longer plan to give any kind of financial support, so I will have to work for myself. I don't have much personal savings, it would only probably last me a week, at max. I do not intend to appeal either. They are not very good parents.

I think I can do high school grad level jobs with ease (yes they pay low but I have to start somewhere), while setting aside personal time to pursue my studies (not neccessarily formal education).

"So, recently my wife and I moved to my hometown - in part to help out my family, and my parents offered us their house for peanuts (they're building a new one). I've been cleaning for myself for about 25 years. I have a job lined up starting next summer. In the meantime I've taken work cleaning with a guy I've known for years. He started a company a couple years ago. I'm a pretty quiet person, and I don't mind doing things a different way if my employer wants me to. But he.....well, doesn't have a clue what he's doing. He's got huge contracts with a bunch of employees. He's not mean at all, but just says things like 'no, no, no, do it this way'. I should add there is a bit of a language/cultural barrier too. And when I say he's doing things wrong, it's not just a different way - he's putting chemicals that take wax off the floor over time - things like that. If I bring it up, he just sort of interrupts and tells me his experience with it.

 This came to a bit of a head the other night when he asked me how much I'd charge to strip a certain floor. He proceeded to tell me 'no, you charge far too much - market value is half of that at the most'. No discussion, even when I said I've been doing this for a long time and never had trouble with work. 

In addition to all of this, he works like he's in a panic. And he's usually hovering right by me, watching everything I do while he works too. I'll be mopping a floor, and he will come up, tell me to go start the next section and take the mop  instead of letting me finish up. It's all incredibly frustrating for me. 

I can't help but wonder if this is all because I'm used to working on my own or if he's truly hard to work with. I know some other people avoid working with/for him because he drives them crazy. The guy would give you the shirt off his back, but he's just a bit too manic for me. And he has a bunch of jobs. Probably works about 12 or more hours a day, 7 days a week. 

Since I start another job next summer, I can't very well go out and get my own contracts. I'm seriously thinking about taking a full time job somewhere around town, even if it doesn't pay that well, just to get away from working for him. I should add I'm not exactly making much with him. Although I have a suspicion I get paid more than his other employees (some are from his home country, and he tries to give them work usually). Anyway, looking for any advice or thoughts on this stressful situation

"Hi all,

So I’ve been looking for jobs like crazy over the last few months and I found one I was very interested in. I am looking for something in accounting and the company in this case is Grant Thornton. A few days after I applied, I receive an email from the company’s automated service that the attraction team is interested and they want to schedule a phone screening, expect to receive a call/email in a few days (Oct 4). So today (Oct 11) I checked my junk email and it looks like the recruiter from the firm emailed me on (Oct 1) with a link to his calendar to set up the phone screen. I replied instantly and set up a meeting for (Oct. 16) on his calendar. In my response email, I sincerely apologized for the delay due to my junk mail and I told him I looked forward to seeing him. 

Am I totally screwed? I’m not sure what else I could’ve done. I normally check my junk every couple days but there have been so many internet scams recently so I guess I forgot. I feel terrible. Anyone have any advice?",Didn’t reply to a recruiter for 10 days,0
"TLDR at the bottom.

I am in the process of being hired as a full time employee of a local grocery store. Meat cutter, if that is relevant or anyone cares. I will be leaving my current job but would also like an additional week or 2 after that before starting the new job.

I have to go back Wednesday to finish all the paper work and what not and get the rest of the information, but they mentioned how they were excited to get everything done and get me working asap, yay!..but not really.

Ideally I would like to start the second week of November. The first week of the month is rather hectic for food service as food stamps are released. I would prefer not be thrown that far into the deep end by starting at such as a busy time in a new environment. The real reason however, is that I would like to travel one last time to see my SO as I am in a LDR. I wont earn a vacation for at least a year so it seems like a good time. I mentioned it to my mom and she told me to NOT tell them that I want to travel. However either way, I would really prefer not to start near the first of the month. Would it be bad to try and set my own start date?

This is all assuming BTW that they wanna get rolling immediately. I don't even have enough information yet about when I would start. Hell, this could all be pointless because they may not start me for a month! Just something running through my mind. If its a big no no then I guess ill have to deal with it and start when they want me to.

"I recently started working a new job. It’s going great so far. But some comments from coworkers in a new department have me a bit concerned...or am I being overly sensitive? 

The first thing, one of the coworkers mentioned a tea bag packet possibly being seen as a “condom” whenever he pulls one out of his backpack. I brushed this off, but I wonder if it’s indication of anything...weird with these people. 

The second thing, I stopped by the other day to speak to these 2 coworkers of mine and talked about how we should do a joint event visiting our firm’s office in another state. One of the guys mentioned how we should set their office on fire (as a joke or something). I didn’t get it so just sort of ignored it. Then, the other guy mentioned how they should figure out “where to hide the bodies”. I was incredulous and tried to pass it off me joking too since they’re my new coworkers- “whyyy? I don’t get it...okay, I’ll leave you guys to your weirdness”. And I just nervously laughed a bit and left. 

Now, as a woman that’s experienced lots of harassment/stalking/men wanting to hurt me, and the constant stories you hear about men killing women and violence in general...I really don’t appreciate these kinds of jokes, especially in the workplace, and honestly get a bit worried when people joke this way.

"I left my job of 17 years 4 months ago due to health issues, I was General Manager of a restaurant. I started applying to jobs a few months ago and have not had any luck, I've mostly been applying to entry level retail and restaurant positions. A chain restaurant in my area is opening a new location and had open interviews today, I signed up for an interview and was given a slot, but told to go online and fill out an application, which also included an assessment. The assessment was 30 questions, the directions said to answer each question honestly, that there are no wrong answers. I then got an automated email confirming my interview. When I arrived to check in for the interview, the manager told me I did not pass the assessment, and therefore would not be able to interview. 

I'm pretty frustrated now, and I'm not sure what I did wrong in the assessment.

Well... I mean no not really. Even though I can browse for jobs on my computer, I don't feel comfortable having an actual phone interview during business hours. My boss does not know I'm looking for a new job, so I can't just tell him ""Hey I've got a job interview, I'll be in late"".

"I work in software. I'm the lead UX designer. I joined this company in February, mostly because I loved the manager that hired me. In April, the CPO (Chief Product Officer) fired her because he felt she wasn't doing enough. He became my direct manager.

He put me on her project, which is not in my wheelhouse or interests. My new team works in a difference office across the country, and I hadn't met any of them  (one of them has turned out to be egocentric and challenging to work with). The CPO also strictly micromanaged and made me skip most of the design process I usually use (he's not a designer). As a team, we pretty much worked in a chaotic way that didn't make sense. It's been a hellish six months. But I rolled with the punches and have been surviving. Deadline is January.

A couple weeks ago, he informed us that he was moving the deadline to November, shaving off two months of time. All the engineers had to assess what could be built in time for the new deadline. The result is a Frankenstein-ed mess, with most of my six months of work thrown out the window.

I'm all for launching scaled-back releases, getting results and data, and iterating for new releases. But I seriously feel shitty about this version we're releasing. Worse of all, I've been working 55+ hour weeks and traveling back and forth to work with the remote team. I broke down and cried in my hotel room during my last trip...which was a first for me. And this won't end until the November release. I feel as if I don't have any support.

If I quit now, this project would probably still launch. It would be a lot more work and gray hairs for the team. My resistance to quitting is my guilt of making it harder for the engineers I work with. And also looking bad to my other colleagues because of the timing.

But there is a part of my mind that is blocked and refuses to cooperate anymore with this job search.  Despite my meditation, sometimes there is a voice in my head that says: ""You know, Einstein said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.  Isn't that what you've been doing for a year?""  And there is a sensation that I am sending my applications straight into a black hole, with no one on the other side to read it.

So at this point, a year into the process, I am suffering very obvious burnout.  In the past, I used to grind for 6+ hours per day working on apps / networking / recruiters, with some breaks for exercise and some phone calls with friends (to stay human?).  But recently, after these final round interviews, I find myself (waking up the morning after the interview, or especially the day that I receive a rejection after the final round) just lying in bed for hours and spacing out.  When I do try to work on applications, my eyes go out of focus, and I forget what I was writing halfway through a paragraph, close out of MS word and watch a youtube video for an hour.  Sometimes, these burnout episodes last 2 or 3 days, and even after that, I can only grind for 3 or 4 hours per day.

For those of you who have gone through this: is this burnout normal?  Am I going crazy?  And do you have any tips for recharging motivation back into my ""battery"", figuratively speaking?  Thanks so much!",Been job-searching for a year. Suffering burnout. Is this normal? How do you handle this?,0

"I just graduated with a BA in psych, I am *quite* in debt for it, and I’ve been looking for a job for about 8 months. I am willing to relocate, but I’m trying really hard to work someplace directly related to my field. 

I want to go into clinical psych, so I’m also in the process of applying to grad school, I thought that I would have a lab job by now tho, so my application will also be weaker.

I’m looking for a post bacc position in a laboratory, I had one over the summer which was paid, but it was essentially like an internship, because the wage I was getting basically only paid my rent, to live in a city I was only in to work that job. 
Once their funding ran out, I moved back in with my parents, who live out in a fairly rural area, the only readily available jobs here are in the marijuana industry, or being a firefighter. 

I feel qualified for the type of job I’m looking for. I have lab experience, and I’ve worked in all sorts of different settings for the past 12 years. 

But I’ve only gotten a total of 3 job interviews, I’ve probably applied to around 100 jobs. Mostly in labs at universities, but also to some clinics and hospitals. For most positions I’ve had all the desired qualifications.

"This is my second job out of college, and I have been working  at an ad agency for 8 months. I actually haven't had any ""reviews""  since my first day, but my manager will be going on leave soon so we had an ""informal check in.""

I met with my manager and the head of the department, and they had absolutely nothing positive to say about my performance. They said they were ""especially concerned"" with me out of everyone else on our team, and asked if I was happy here, and whether or not I liked my job.

I am completely blindsided &amp; genuinely disagree with everything they said I needed to improve on. The list was vague, saying ""low productivity,"" ""low retention,"" (which I understood to be a polite way of implying they think I am dumb as a rock) ""poor attention to detail,"" ""lack of resourcefulness,"" ""no sense of urgency,"" and ""poor follow through.""

In terms of productivity, I have been working 9:30am-7pm or even 8pm most nights, and I don't get paid overtime. I've missed dates and gym classes and spending time with my family to stay late at work to finish my assignments. Last week, one of my co-workers didn't finish her projects from a month ago, so I stayed late on a Friday and did them all for her since she had to catch a flight and was OOO.

For ""low retention,"" I've received absolutely no training to ""retain"" anything. My first day, I watched an hour long power point presentation about the company with HR, and then I was brought to my desk and thrown to the wolves. My co-workers even joked about how I had literally no training and it was ""sink or swim"" for me. I taught myself absolutely everything, I scheduled meetings with different departments to learn about what they do, if my manager gave me a task and I didn't know how to do it, I asked around, figured out how to do it, and got it done. Additionally, a few of our new hires come to me for advice because ""I know everything about the company"" and they think of me as ""the big guns.""

I asked for an example when I showed ""low retention,"" and my manager brought up a time recently where I had asked her a question regarding a client presentation I was putting together, as I hadn't seen this type of ad report before. In the review, she said ""you didn't remember how to do it from your training."" I said ""I didn't have training on that, this was my first time doing it,"" and there was just a long awkward silence.

The review ended with them saying they appreciated ""how receptive I was to the feedback"" and I thanked them saying I appreciated having the chance to improve, and that had been really looking forward to discussing my performance. I will now be attending bi-weekly meetings with them for the next few months to ""check in,"" which sounds like I'm under review.

I just am feeling completely demoralized, and worried about my position within the company. It's clear they have a very negative impression of me and my work ethic, and I genuinely don't know how to improve on the points they specified to show that I'm doing ""better,"" because I already feel I am giving 100% in those areas. Help!

TLDR; My performance review seems unfair and I'm not sure how to improve because I genuinely feel I am working at 100%. How can I show them I am improving if I don't know what to change?","I just had a horrible performance review, but completely disagree with every point they made. Help?",0
"I am 27 and I am a **Social Media Coordinator and I make $17 an hour.** Let that sink in for a second. 

So, I have been working at a small fashion company for almost 2 years now. During my first year, even though I did social media stuff, the President of the company taught me basically everything he knew - Social media marketing, all aspects of Adobe Suite, Email Marketing, Warehouse management, SEO, Web development, event marketing. Basically, he taught me everything. During year one, I mostly did social media stuff and I did warehouse stuff with the warehouse team whenever they needed me. So, those were really my two major functions. During year 1, I went from making $16 an hour to $17 an hour.

During year 2 (this year)... the company started falling apart. 4 out of 6 of our warehouse workers quit. Our fashion designer quit. And the president of the company quit. It's a small company, FYI. That is when the owner of the company  (the founder) stepped up to the plate and started having a more hands on approach in the company. This all happened during May of this year. 

The owner of the company asked me what I knew how to do and when I showed him I was taught pretty much everything the president of the company taught me, the owner started gradually giving me more and more tasks outside of my normal job. 

Right now I am doing:

\-Controlling all our social media pages

\-Creating content for our wholesale customers

\-Media buying

\-Discussing and setting prices for the products on our retail shops

\-Creating and designing our catalogs

\-Maintaining and updating our 3 websites

\-Building new websites

\-Setting up Amazon, Ebay and Shopify shops

\-Controlling and maintaining inventory

\-Managing customer service from our online shops and social media outlets

\-Whatever else the owner wants me to do.

This time of year is usually our busiest season and he keeps emailing me every 10 minutes about little things that aren't important. He keeps calling me over small things and giving me really irrelevant tasks (like signing up for shows, which he can do himself since he controls all the company credit cards). 

Whenever I ask for his help, he just tells me to ""Please figure it out"".

He also just purchased a new warehouse 60 miles away from me (1 hour and 10 minutes) and he hired 3 new warehouse workers and he wants me to spend the rest of the month over there helping to train them and help ship orders. 

Since we also lost our photographer, he wants me to learn to take pictures and set up a photoshoot by next week. Today, he had me stay later for work and he called back the former president of the company for an hour to show me to how to photoshoots. So... I got an hour crash course, and he expects me to be a ""pro"" by next week when we shoot photos of the models wearing our gear.

I am doing all this work, and he hasn't even mentioned a raise to me. I am doing the former president's job, the warehouse workers job, the sales team job and some of the fashion designers job including my own.

"Hi there, throwaway account here. Basically I think I've been hired at Joann Fabrics (though they never specified if I was hired or not, and they never have to time answer my questions on that), and I'm really worried about with how events have been rolling out considering schedules and organization. This is my first job ever so I'm very inexperienced in how this whole job thing works

First things first, I've been waiting for two weeks on my employee schedule being set. I've been told from the manager that I would get a call back in the next day or two that my schedule is ready, which never happened. I had to call back multiple times in order to get any updates. When I did talk with the manager all she said was that she was working on the schedule right now and immediately hung up after since she was really busy. No calls from her afterwards so I had to call again, which resulted in the same answers. Is this a sign that the job has decided to lay me off without directly informing me? I'm confused about this

Secondly and lastly, I'm worried about the job itself. I have no idea what position I have, but I assumed it was being a cashier since my training talked about that a lot. Though, the training really confused me. Basically the lady training us sat us in a room having us take notes on how to deal with customers wanting a class and how to set them up at the cash register. Next they explained that we will be also taking care of small fabric orders at the register and we will be required to take some sewing classes of some sort in order to be a cashier. I had questions, but they got blown off since the training had to be quickly rushed. We didn't learn a lick of information on how to operate a cash register. The training lady told us that they'll be having the more experienced employees use the shadowing system to show us how to use it, and then leave us to our own devices from there

I have recently been juggling whether or not to get my MBA. Here's my situation:

Currently I work in a senior accounting position managing a department of 3 (non-staff accountants, not an accounting manager). My short-term/Medium term goal right now is to work as a senior financial analyst in a medium to large size company, or an accounting manager (upward progression). Eventually I would want to be head of corporate valuations or a controller/CFO. Would 100% like to stay corporate and non-bank, I like my work life balance.

I recently came across an opportunity to go back and get my MBA with a concentration in Finance. Not a top 10 school however AACSB accredited, and a lot cheaper. The MBA in finance would kill two birds with one stone for me, as I need 3 more classes that I can't afford to be eligible for my CPA, plus the MBA part would be great too.

I'm kind of yo-yoing back and forth as to whether or not this would be worth taking on the new debt. I realize top 10 schools would be better for job, networking all that, however it's just simply out of my means as it stands right now.

So, I worked at a retail company with varying degrees of responsibility from 2009-2015, however, I noticed I put the end year as 2016 to a company I have a second interview With tomorrow.

"Let's put it this way.

I'm working with my first ever client, let's call him X. X has a system made in WordPress that is a listing website in which he allows users to sell their heavy machinery.

He is thinking about going 'big', planning to promote it, going to events to talk about it, etc.

He contacted me because he knew I was desperate to get a programming gig/internship/etc and did not really cared about getting paid; which by the way, when he called me, he made himself look bigger, I though he already had the company, employees, etc. It turns out, the company is just a single guy with not income to back up the features that he is asking me to build from scratch .-. .

To continue, I'd like to say that I have tons of experience using CodeIgniter which is a PHP framework that has never given me any kind of trouble and decided to work with it since I saw myself getting it done in three months, not big deal.

Everything so far is going well, I go to our second meeting in which I show him what I have built so far and he gets impressed because he actually though that it was going to take me longer ..... it did not. The problem came when he said that I should move to Laravel because he did his research and found out that there is almost no CodeIgniter developers at all, which is something I highly agree with.

Then, I'm buying a lot of Udemy courses because I do not have experience with Laravel at all - well, yes I do but not a lot - to rewrite everything that I have built to this point.

Here it is a list of some of the features the current system has that I will end up building - If I continue working with him - :

* Admin dashboard
* Users dashboard
* Public Views
* Login, Register and Verification system.
* email HTML builder

I know how to build pretty much everything that I mentioned except by the email html builder(he wants to be able to create different templates to use when sending emails; so I guess I will save the style, etc in the DB as well).

Not problem with it at all to be hones but I'm a full time student and I'm trying to look for an actual job.

Basides in my school, I'm studying computer science, so you can say I'm learning all of these languages at the same time:

* C++
* Java
* PHP(Laravel syntax and best practices)
* SQL

and in my spare time, just like an hour every Monday and Tuesday I'm trying to learn the MERN stack as well(you can add it in the end of the previous list).

I actually feel overwhelmed :(.

What do you guys think, should I continue working with him even after telling him that it will probably take me longer than 7 months(due to school and wanting to work; something to which I never received an answer, he pretty much ignored it when I told him...as if I never told it to him).

I’m also finding it super difficult to even get interviews so when I got an email inviting me to an interview I was ecstatic!

However... I went to Glassdoor to look at the reviews and just have a nose at the company, company research if you will, and there was a lot of very similarly written, ridiculously positive 5 star reviews. Good sign? I don’t think so, in the ‘cons’ section it was all “genuinely can’t think of any” (every single review that did this used the word genuinely) or “here’s a con but actually it’s a massive pro well done” and then the company replying saying “wow thanks we are great aren’t we look how fantastic an employer we are”. Then I looked further down the reviews and found a LOT of 1 star reviews of the company saying that the 5 star ones were fake and that the new management (who it seemed all of the lower reviews absolutely despised) were told by the chairman to write these brilliant reviews to attract people to jobs. I could tell from a mile off that the 5 star reviews were ridiculous.

I also found it weird that the 5 star reviews said they “valued hard workers and the job is not for the faint hearted everyone has to be a ~family~” whilst the lower reviews all said that management bullied people and if you didn’t suck up to the it doesn’t matter how hard you work you won’t progress. 

Also the “sexist and racist” culture made me worry but I also take reviews that say that with a pinch of salt because that’s a strong accusation to make.

Problem is l am desperate for the job, on the other hand, reading the reviews I actually believe are real even the higher ones say there is a large bully culture within management. This will be my first “proper” job after leaving college if I get the job.

My interview is today so I can update if anyone was interested but I feel like these are major red flags. I’d rather work for a lower rated company that wasn’t trying to push a fake image online it’s really weird to me.

"Hello!

I'm a finalist for 2 positions at 2 different companies, and expecting offers from both next week. If I do get both offers, I'll need to choose which one. Both have their pros and cons, but it can be summarized as: one has AMAZING benefits and growth potential, and one has an AMAZING salary. I don't know which would be a better option.

&amp;#x200B;

**Job 1:** ""manager"" title, so it's higher up in the company, and more responsibility. Medium sized company - not much room for career growth, however it's in the same industry that I've been in for 7 years, so I could likely be considered a ""lifer"" in this industry soon and could get some really nice work-from-home jobs at any company in the industry. Salary $95k. No bonus. 10 days vacation. Mediocre health plan - high deductible and high premiums. 50% tuition reimbursement (I'm considering getting a MBA). 3% 401k match. No maternity leave - you need to use PTO or go unpaid (Starting a family is in my 5 year plan). No work from home. No other benefits. Company has 1.8 star rating on glassdoor - ouch.

**Job 2:** ""specialist"" title, so it's a lower on the totem pole role with less responsibility. Huge global corporation - tons of room for upward growth. Totally new industry that is less interesting to me personally than the one I'm in now, but who knows I may grow to love it. Salary $75k + Bonus (dont know what % yet). 8% 401k match. 25 days vacation. Exceptional and cheap health plan. On-site gym with free unlimited personal training. On-site cafeteria with a food budget. 100% tuition reimbursement. Free auto insurance. Mobile phone discounts. Credit card with special employee cashback rates. Stock options. 4 months paid 100% maternity leave. Work from home 2 days a week to begin, with the option to do work from home 100% in the future if I'd like. Company has a 3.9 star rating on glassdoor.

&amp;#x200B;

I got along with both teams that I interviewed with very well, so I think I'd be equally happy with my supervisor and peers at either role as far as I can tell.

"So there’s a company I’m (24M) interested to work for that has a position open that would help me stay in grad school and be a bit more stable in my life as a whole. My last few years have been wildly erratic in terms of hours/moves/etc.

It’s not exactly the job I want, but it’s a reputable company in my industry so I can at least remain involved while in grad school. The issue is the position is listed as “30K and DOE.” I don’t make much as is, a lot of compromising for my industry, but this job would require a cross country move, and I’m unwilling to work a second job there because it’d interfere with time needed for school. 

The other thing is I’m more than qualified for the day to day ops of this job. I’ve worked three years extensively in roles where I have lots of references, great feedback, etc. I know my stuff and my undergrad background helps with most of what this position requires. But, if I’m moving cross country and am doing all this, I can’t take under $45K. Even then, I think $50k is where I’m starting to now look.

It’s not me being cocky or arrogant, but I know with my background, my undergrad degree, grad studies, references, etc - I’ve earned not having to work two jobs and just not be in school. But, what I’m seeking is 15-20K more than what they have listed. I don’t know if DOE is that flexible. But I’m wondering how to navigate this in the interview setting.

"Hello! To give a little background to my situation, I am a recent college grad as of May and when I moved back home I immediately decided to work at a retail store until I started grad. I started the retail job in May and due to my retail experience, I was immediately promoted to part-time manager/key holder.) 

The job was fine until a month in. The min wage just went up by this time so I only got almost a dollar more as a manager than a regular sales associate. But in terms of the job, the company would leave me alone in the clothing store (which is a pretty big store with two large entrances that holds a male and female section with fitting rooms and an accessories section) for several hours while giving me a bunch of boxes of clothing shipment to open and hang and put back before someone else came in for a shift. I honestly did not mind the workload. However, customers would bombard me asking for fitting rooms, help, and check out all at the same time. This made doing all the tasks and running the store alone very difficult especially when you have to wait until the store cleared up to even use the bathroom.) 

On the Fourth of July, my management told me the mall was going to be slow. They put me alone for 6 hours. The mall was crowded that day and on top of that, everything in the store was 5 dollars except for new items. The lines were out the door (far from the register). I was not able to clean, open fitting rooms, or watch the store. When a sales associate came in, we were barely able to get off the registers making us miss our break. Customers were also yelling at us for not being able to assist. When the store finally closed the manager texted me saying I had one hour to count the register (we had to clock out at that time exactly) and recover the store. The condition of the store was one that needed 3 hours at least to fix, but my store manager said to do the most that we could. We left an hour later after doing the most we could and the next day I received long passive-aggressive messages from the other key holder and my assistant manager with pictures saying how my work yesterday was unacceptable.)

That was the first strike. To be more general, I'm tired of being left alone running a large store and having to do multiple tasks with no breaks for a dollar more than an associate. Please let me know if I'm overreacting. I had the flu 3 weeks ago and since my store manager was on vacation and no other manager (there's 4) wanted to cover, I had to come in every day and work long shifts alone until a store associate came in to close. When people call out I have to stay alone and close for hours till midnight. My coworkers are a bit passive-aggressive as well, they always text me on my days off or about requested days off and ask if I ""realllyy"" need the day off. I feel stepped on and overworked. I even feel like they say things behind my back about me. Especially when they ask personal questions and demand reasons as to why I'm taking off. Furthermore, this is a part-time position but I always hit 39.5 or 40 hours per week.)

Anyways, I found another retail store (a small store!) in the same mall and I talked to the store manager there and she offered me a position after I told her my situation. She said she'd give me part-time hours and a bonus and that I can start next week.) 

I was about to give my 2 weeks or say that I can only work short hours when I got a call from my store manager today saying she got promoted and she's leaving the state next week and that the other keyholder can work only one day next week due to her new job. That leaves me and one other manager for all of next week and I'd have to open and close the store from 9 am to 10pm.) 

So Reddit, my ultimate question is, should I give my two weeks today and drop off the letter in the store (and what should I say!) or not say anything and attempt to work the two jobs I have now (while applying to grad schools).

"Spouse received a job offer today. During the second interview they asked what she was expecting as far as salary. She gave them the low and high end based off her experience in the field. The company is shifting people around to give her this position which they hadn't planned to do until they saw her resume'. She told them she didn't expect to make what she was making at her previous job.

They offered her the  lowest number she gave. It's a full benefits package and PTO is 40hrs the first year on an accrued basis then goes to 80hrs the second year.

The question is what negotiation room do you think there is? She is thinking of asking for $2500 more a year plus 80hrs PTO the first year. Should she just ask for one and not the other or is both ok. First time being in this situation. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.",Negotiations on a job offer,0
"So a little bit of background info: I'm a December 2018 business grad who after months of job searching finally got a job at a decent company but it's in the call center. To save the details, the job is honestly one of the worst jobs I've ever had and I want out.

"I'm not currently looking for a job though I'm always keeping an eye out for opportunity and it's quite disturbing how many of you treat prospective employees.  Yet many companies will never see my application for reasons that effectively boil down to companies showing little to no respect for prospective employees' time and privacy.  As a highly skilled IT engineer/manager with +20 years of deep and varied experience, this is your loss.  

Here are three of the most common reasons you didn't see my application or I withdrew from the hiring process.  

1- Excessive time to apply
Using services like Taleo is a sure-fire way to never see my resume.  I don't have the time to take 2 hours and fill out page after page of forms and drop down lists when I have a properly formatted and concise résumé.  I took the time and effort to make it easy to read and understand exactly what my KSAs and experience are.  For candidates not currently employed this limits the number of applications they can complete per day and makes thing harder for them.  It's disrespectful and and gross.  If you're too lazy to look at my PDF (which you can easily scan with any OCR app every HR dept has if you need keywords for your database) then you're not truly interested in finding the best candidate, you're satisfied with the most convenient.  

2- Invasion of privacy
What I do on my own time is my own business.  If you want me to pee in a cup before you'll hire me you can piss off, pun intended.  If you want to know about my personal life and habits, you can't.  You have no right to inquire what I do on my own time.  When I'm at work and whenever I am representing the company (no kids, the corporate line that you always represent the company is a company line used to control you and is utter bollocks...representing the company means on the clock) then yes, you have every right to demand that I show up sober and appropriate and I should be terminated if I break that agreement.  If anything happens on the job that calls my sobriety into question, you deserve to know.  But you will have no access to my bodily fluids or personal history otherwise. 

It's gross and disgusting that so many people queue up and walk down the sheep chute to allow this egregious invasion of our persons by corporate interests.  I understand why those in need of a job do it and it's a blot on our society that we've allowed corporate entities so much power over us.  

Caveat and exception- the above view does not apply persons applying to positions dealing with the public trust such as military, police, fire brigade, health care, providing care to children and the elderly, and other such areas where another's health and safety is in the hands of the employee given the consequences to society as a whole.  

3- Unreasonable number of interviews.  
Going through 7 rounds of interviews (the largest number in my personal experience, I've head stories of more) is entirely unreasonable and blatantly insulting to ask of someone using every spare moment to find a job.  If you can't sort if you want to hire me or not after 1 or 2 face to face meetings then the problem is yours.  I'm not about to pay for your incompetent hiring process with my valuable time, petrol, and effort.  If you want me to meet with multiple people, do it in a series of meeting ON THE SAME DAY. Don't ask me to burn multiple days of my life.  If you can't respect my life and situation before the offer letter, what makes me think you'll do it after?  

I know I'm fortunate in having a choice and the ability to walk away from employers who clearly do not respect their employees.  I don't begrudge anyone who needs a job from jumping through whatever hoops they have to to survive.  

The problem is at a higher level, we have collectively sat on our backsides and watched complacently as employers have, tiny bit by tiny bit, wheedled their way into having power over our personal lives.  We've let ourselves be bamboozled that the employer holds all the cards.  They do, until we take a stand and draw a line in the cheap, office carpet.  All it takes is a choice to say no, I deserve respect.

Maybe these examples seem small to you or no big deal, but I have to ask what's next?  When I started in my career asking someone to submit to a medical test was unheard of.  Now, people hand over part of their bodies to their employees as a matter of course.  Where does it end?  In another 10 years will employers get full access to your medical records?  Or DNA test?  

If you have the ability to choose, don't work for an employer that wants to treat you like cattle.  Sadly, that's most of them these days.",On employers not respecting job seekers' time and privacy,0

"I'm a student, and thinking about transitioning out of my current retail position around late December-January. I know it sounds kinda weird/cop out-ish, especially for a measly part-time job, but hear me out.

Main reasons are to start my nursing school application in January and study for its entry exam, finish off the remainder of my general ed classes in the spring semester (not required for the nursing program but for the associate's degree as a whole), and just to give myself a personally needed break from the work-school-life combo. The application itself would be due in February, and the acceptance notification (as well as the invitation to take the entry exam) would be in March.

However, I was explicitly told that if I'm a nursing student, I can't count on holding down a job while attending school, because the curriculum workload and clinical shifts are just not flexible enough, even for night shifts. A.k.a., I'd be burned out.

"Hey all!

So I’m currently doing a job in which I was being trained to be a Behaviourist for dogs.
I’ve always loved working with animals so I thought this would be great and the pay wasn’t terrible. In the animal industry that a massive plus!

The internship I'm doing has a stipend, but I get it in 2 halves, one in about a month or so and one at the end in two months. I'll probably end up putting it all in my savings to cover what I've taken out so far and pad my savings a bit.

So to keep this simple, I am scheduled for an interview with a popular ecommerce website next week. I come from working with Amazon ecommerce. I have had 1.5 years of experience in this role and (from my opinion) have really learned very little with my current position, which is one of the reasons why I am looking for another position.

This position I believe is a solid in if I can get through the phone call interview of 2 hours with 4 different people. Essentially, I put down decent references and I believe those were a key to get me in. The position is not open any longer and, since this is through a recruiter from a 3rd party job agency, I've learned that only a handful of candidates made it this far. 

I am fairly good with interviews- especially on the phone. But I feel I can easily connect and have a great conversation with a variety of people who I interview with. 

I feel like this position is something I am very unqualified for. I've worked for a manager who was essentially doing what I would be doing. But I never had the experience of actually doing this myself. 

I have the job description if this would be easier to dissect that way. But basically, I feel like I would be able to perform this role really well. Unfortunately, I am under-qualified.

&amp;#x200B;

Last spring, I applied for an internship (business analytics) and got an on-site interview, which went okay. One of the interviewers, (senior position) connected with me on LinkedIn during the interview in case I had any follow-up questions. I got rejected, and I am now a senior applying for jobs. One of the openings I want to apply for (data analyst) is at the same company, and within the same team that he is in.

&amp;#x200B;

Would contacting him be appropriate (if he even remembers me - we only spoke for \~15-20 minute)? If so, what would I even say? The position seems pretty fitting, and my qualifications/experience have definitely improved due to my internship over the summer. I want to be able to increase my chances as much as possible, but I also don't want to overdo it and hurt my chances by contacting him.

&amp;#x200B;

Any input would be very appreciated, thank you!!",Applying for a job where I was previously rejected (after an on-site interview). Should I mention this to a LinkedIn contact/prior interviewer of mine?,0
"So I was offered a job and I think I was given a low ball pay rate. I know I messed up when the recruiter asked me how much I wanted to make and I gave a range. He offered me a rate very low on that range and I think probably about 10k off from what I should be making. I know I messed up and not because I am desperate but because I am really bad when it comes to negotiating salary. He has not been very forth coming with how much the company is willing to pay. 

The situation is interesting because the company does not want a contracted person for long. They want to pick up the person quickly if they feel it is a good fit. The hiring manager said he doesn't expect for the contract to last more than a month before a final offer is made. 

Does the recruiter and the company work together on salary? Or does the company tell the recruiter how much they intend to pay and he makes a commission based on how 'cheap' he gets an employee?

Did I doom myself and I'm going to get a low offer if they pick me up? Or is it possible that I get the salary I am expecting once they make their offer?",I think I messed up my salary working with a recruiter,0

I'm a CS student from France and I'm writing my resume, looking for an internship in the us.

"I'm starting my career as a real estate agent and have been meeting with different brokers and checking out brokerages around the city where I live. I'm having a really hard time choosing a brokerage, and along the way I had an odd interview experience. Here are descriptions of the options I have so far:

&amp;#x200B;

1. First brokerage is a speciality, small, independent brokerage. The man who owns it is in his late 60's and he mostly does real estate investing and that's his niche but he also sells and rents here and there. He has two other guys working for him, one young agent around my age (23/24) and another who's about 45. I met them both and they were delightful, very friendly people. I live in the neighborhood where the company is located. The broker is a genuinely good guy, pure of the soul - he's one of those people who could easily and effortlessly get along with anyone. I felt really comfortable around him. They have a lot of rentals and sales on the market.

* Pros: Super friendly broker and agents, small brokerage, 70/30 split, printing, business cards, everything provided, no desk fees or any other fees besides MLS and other necessary memberships. He has a wealth of knowledge, knows everything about finances and real estate investing (which I want to get into in a few years), is going to mentor me, great reviews online, literally a 2 minute walk from my apartment. Prices for rent for them range from $2,000 to $4,000 and for sales it's $500,000-$2.5M. He guaranteed new agents who work for him make $50,000-$100,000 on average their first year. He was honest and said it may take a while, sometimes months (though unusual) for an agent to start earning money, but once the first client rolls in, it's a snowball effect going forward. He has numerous connections with people all over the city, and I met two of his investor friends who own a majority of properties in our neighborhood. There are leads but I'm responsible for marketing. He gave me really valuable advice on networking as well. We bonded over Barbara Corcoran and women in the real estate business, books and art, we spent nearly 4 hours talking. I could help him elevate his business with social media and changing up the outside of property, etc. I could see myself making a good name here and still earning a decent income without much internal competition, actually building relationships with people in the neighborhood I live in, and having a balanced work and personal life. The office is on the semi-casual side which I like, too.
* Cons: Although the broker is a genuinely good guy, he talks a mile a minute and I noticed he doesn't stay on topic for long. He talks *a lot.* I would ask a simple question and it would take forever, sometimes never, to get a detailed answer. Training is completely independent. There are no classes, nothing. It's all on your own. I would be able to shadow him for a while, he'll teach me how to write an offer and so forth. His real estate group has several subscriptions so he said it's mostly reading. I would need to work from my own computer which isn't a problem for me but did strike me as a little negative. The office is super small, two desks and one Apple desktop, though the space is clean, warm, inviting, and in an amazing location - I saw probably 50 people walk by and peek inside while we were talking. What struck me as a huge red flag was when he was describing a story to me and said how a seller told him someone at a big name company said the homes price was worth $580,000 and another agent from another company said $590,000 but he suggested $610,000. The seller wanted $605,000 and the property got an offer for $607,000. He said he accepted the offer right away before telling the seller (yikes) but the seller was thrilled. I don't know if this shows his expertise or lack of knowledge when it comes to pricing properly. Another red flag was he said you're not supposed do this, but he does anyways, which is when an owner says they only want females or males in the apartment, you only choose that requested sex to rent. I think it's because he's old so he doesn't care but that stood out to me as a negative. The agents who work there have also only been there for one year. He told me that's because it's such a small company that he only keeps it around to help out family, people he knows, etc when they're in real estate - he's never hired someone he didn't know before. He said he would hire me because I was the only person to ever cold call and that impressed him.
* Another bonus con: This is isn't a luxury brokerage, which is the industry of real estate I initially wanted to go into (now I'm more open minded about it; the neighborhood I live in is one of the most expensive in our state, and right now it's a picky buyers market so selling has become challenging even in the luxury world).

&amp;#x200B;

2. Second brokerage is an international luxury brokerage. There are five currently in my state and they're opening up another location next year. Extremely formal, serious work environment. Definitely feels corporate the second you walk in. They're selling a lifestyle, not just a home.

* There are around 70 agents, 12 of those are teams. The owners of this location are one of the teams. I had a great interview with one of the agents earlier this week. She was so sweet and we talked for about an hour until the wife, one of the owners, came in.
* I hate to sound like a millennial but here I go - you know when you can just tell that a ""vibe"" is off with someone? I got that right away with the owner. She was cold towards me, saw me in the morning when I walked in to meet the agent but didn't say a word. In the middle of my interview with the agent she walked in and shook my hand. She sat down and asked me right away where I worked before and if I had six months of expenses saved. I told her I met with several agents before getting my license and they all advised me to make sure I had six months saved, so yes, and told her my work experience. She replied, ""We don't sell homes, we sell a lifestyle. Clients can smell desperation."" This came out sounding very passive aggressive. She said she sold over $30 million this past year and asked me what I want out of real estate. I said I was looking to build a reputable, serious, life-long career in an industry where there's constant opportunity for growth. I didn't experience that in my first job and knew I wanted more out of life than that. She made a comment about how I look 16 (I'm 23, petite/athletic build). I noticed there's no diversity at this office, everyone is white, which there's nothing wrong with that but I grew up in an extremely diverse town and went to school where 60% of the student population was international. I'm Latin American, so I was drawn to this company because of their international base but their agents don't reflect that. She asked me how old I was and then automatically said, ""Oh, I'm not supposed to ask that -"" and I said, ""No worries, I'm 23."" She said, ""Yeah, I often say and do things I'm not supposed to."" She said real estate is a tough business, etc, and said, ""It's not about looking good and wearing high heeled shoes."" I felt like this was condescending because I put in the effort to look nice and professional for this interview and I was wearing block-heel styled shoes, less than three inches in height lol.
* She asked me some other things but I said flat out that I'm looking for a strong training program and that I want to shadow a top producer. She said their company doesn't offer shadowing and the company doesn't hire new agents, but it just so happens that a woman on her team is pregnant and is going to leave in January. She said she would talk to her team but asked if I wanted to step in and be an extra set of hands. I would go to showings, listings, see how an offer is made, etc, basically shadow her, her husband, and another team member while the other team member is out. There's only one other team member who's ever shadowed like this before, and it was actually the woman who's currently pregnant. She was in the office and was the first person I met when I walked in the agency. She came into the room and she was really sweet, but I could tell the owner was nice and friendly with the two women but with me she was hard-edged. She said I would be paid for the few months of work while that pregnant woman was out but that there's no guarantee I would end up on a team. She added, however, that lots of people would love me and would probably fight to have me on their team. In my head I was confused and felt slightly gaslighted given her snide comments earlier and demeanor. She said she and no one on her team would ask me to do something they wouldn't do themselves while shadowing. This includes making the beds, planting flowers in the front yard, doing anything that needs to be done basically. She said everyone works A LOT, I should expect 10-15 hour days Monday through Sunday and be available any time after work from mid-December to late March. She also asked me what neighborhood I live in, if I live alone, if I pay rent or own my own place. I thought those were inappropriate questions but answered politely.
* Right after this owner walked out the agent who originally interviewed me asked to see me again tomorrow so I could meet the other owner. I agreed and showed up. This time it was just him and the original agent. This man told me they would pay me $1,000 per month (that's way less than minimum wage in my state) for those months I would shadow. I told him his wife the day prior told me there would be no guarantee to join a team afterwards and I didn't want to waste their time or mine, so if that was the offer I wasn't taking it. He said his wife was impressed by me and thinks I would be a good fit. He said he would let me shadow him, he would personally train me, he would create a business plan with me, and I would be guaranteed to join a team after the few months are up. I said I would think about it and give him a final answer next week.
* Pros: Luxury international brand, reputable and respectable brand, thousands and thousands of listings in the city and beyond, opportunity to make a really high income, will get paid to shadow and there's in-house training with the top producers twice a week, their rentals are $10,000+ and sales begin at $800,000 with the average being in the $5-15M range. This brokerage has all positive reviews.
* Cons: I don't know the commission splits because the conversations moved quickly and the agent I was interviewing with had to leave early both times to teach a training session. I don't know what they'll cover, although I do know headshots, business cards, pamphlets, etc are provided. I felt extremely uncomfortable with the way the owner treated me. If she makes my life a living hell and smears my name and potential reputation as an agent, it doesn't matter that I'm in the company already, no one will add me to their team since she's the one who calls the shots/has the most influence. The offer she gave me and her husband gave me are completely different. To be honest I felt insulted by the $1,000 per month when this company ranks in multi-millions a year.
* Bonus con: Every single person who works at this place was already wealthy before they joined. They don't need this job, none of them used it as a stepping stone in their life to shift from one class to another. They could sell one home a year and it wouldn't matter. There's only one young person in the entire office who's 25. This company never takes new agents and they only hire internally people who have experience. They said they hired her because ""she's different"" - she purchased a home from them when she was 21. I'm genuinely concerned that if hired these people are going to treat me like a charity case and use me to the point it's going to essentially force me out of the business from how miserable the experience will be. They know I don't come from high society/wealth hence the first questions this owner asked me: where I was raised, where my parents were raised, where I live now, if I have roommates or not, if I rent or own property(-ies). I left both meetings feeling down and less than, disrespected and looked at as an idiot who's desperate for anything and would be grateful to just sit at an open house with a measly (to them) $5M price tag. My instincts usually never fail me. In my first career I met with a friendly woman from the company but I could just tell something was off. Once I started working I met the boss above her and I got the exact same feeling with this owner that I had with my previous boss (toxic, passive aggressive, gaslighter, insecure/wants to make young people's lives miserable, etc). There's a difference between being a luxury company owner and seeing a young person full of ambition, and saying, ""I'm so sorry but we don't hire outside of the company. I appreciate your time, take care"" or admiring a young person trying to improve their life and working hard, and welcoming them onto the team. But to go out of your way to make rude/diminishing comments to someone just starting out and then dangle a carrot in front of them? Something is not right there.
* \*\*\*\*\*\*\* I also realized this company violated several protected questions under EEOC: My age, if I rent or own, if I was born here, where I was born, and who I live with.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Third brokerage is known very well within the country. About 30 agents at this location, the only one in our city. Super clean and open office, mostly young people. I met with the CEO and he was just... neutral. Answered some questions I had but didn't engage much in conversation. He said there's web training online but you learn by going out into the field. He said you learn from other agents. If you want to shadow, you have to ask one of them to take you out. This struck me as so off-putting because if these same people are your competition, that's never going to happen. They're always going to be too busy and they likely actually are. He seemed very nonchalant/didn't care - it's every man for himself at this place basically.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to meet a few more companies in the next week but so far the first option seems like the best fit for me. My biggest concern is getting business and I can forget about the luxury market if I start there. Maybe I'm wrong about that though, I've never worked in the real estate business before.

"I received a job offer earlier this month from a bank for a Corporate Analyst Development Program internship for next summer. I am a Finance and Management Information Systems major and this fits more with my tech side I've developed through MIS. I have already extended the offer and it now expires this Monday.

I have 2 interviews next Friday for Consulting internships, which is what interests me the most and is the career I want to go into. The positions are in tech consulting to be specific. One of the companies has already told me I'm a great fit and the conversation has gone very well so far so I'm confident I can land it. The offer that is expiring is a position I am less interested in and is a back-office position at a bank although the pay is high ($25.72/hr with a $1,500 signing bonus). I am not sure what the other position's pay is but based on online research and speaking with others, it should be around $24-30 per hour. The bank position is in Chicago while the two consulting positions are in Minneapolis where I go to school.

I am at a crossroads on what to do. Is it a bad look to extend the offer again? Will they rescind my offer? Should I accept it and still go through with the interviews?

"I will be graduating in December with a Bachelors of Science in Public Administration. My ultimate goal is to manage a hospital/practice. I plan on going for my Masters in Healthcare Administration, however the programs I am looking at require 2-3 years relevant experience.

I currently have little to no relevant experience. I worked previously at a daycare, which I wrote on my resume that I would help with taking payments, answer phones, basic customer service, training staff, and following licensing and daycare policies. I currently am interning at a government office (local government and my internship had to be government related since it's for credit). At my internship, I wrote that I have experience with computer skills, like using Word, Excel, data entry, etc.

Now, I am currently looking for a job for December. All ""entry"" level jobs in Healthcare Admin. seem to require experience. So, I am just trying to find any job that would give me the experience and pays decent. The pay part is where I'm having the most trouble. 

For example, I just got an interview scheduled for a small company. It's not exactly what I'm looking for in healthcare, since this company provides caretakers for the elderly, but it's a start. However, Indeed tells me it pays $11 an hour. I'm looking to move out within the next few months with my boyfriend, who is also starting out, and I don't feel that $11 is enough. Is this reason enough to turn down a job? Sure, it might get my foot in the door, but if I take the job, I'd feel required to work there for at least 1-2 years and I just don't want to be pinching pennies for the next two years.

I understand I won't be making a six figure salary or even close to that anytime soon. But, the lowest I want to go salary wise is $35,000 a year and that's the absolute lowest. My ideal would be $40,000.

"I just started an office job at a giant corporation two and a half weeks ago. The department I work in is very small. Our offices are housed with some other, larger departments. I share my office with a colleague from my department. Unlike most of the offices in the building, it's not an open cubicle but an actual office with a door we can close. 

Since I started, we've kept the door shut with a note on it that says ""Come on in."" This was OKed by our boss. Still, I had noticed that the office atmosphere seemed to encourage open doors at all times. But since our boss never told us we need to keep the door open, we just kept it closed. 

Today, I passed a guy who works in a different department, someone whose name I know but I have never spoken to, on my way to the restroom. We passed each other, got about five feet apart, and then he turned around and called my name. He walked back to me, made a big show of sitting down at an empty table, looked up and away like he was thinking something really deep, and asked, ""I have a question for you. Why do you keep your door closed?"" 

I was surprised he would ask me this, as we do not work together. I just stammered something about preferring to work without distraction. He then started telling me that keeping the door closed was something he and others had picked up on; it sent a negative message to everyone;  it was not ""The \[Giant Corporation\] Way"" or in keeping with the company culture; and he was just trying to let me know that it wasn't being perceived well. He also said that if I am distracted, my company could see about getting me some headphones (!!!).

I just started less than three weeks ago. My boss has never said anything to me about this, and her office is right next to mine. I'm working as a contractor here, so I never got an orientation or anything - I just went straight to work.

I'm upset because I feel like his lecture was condescending. He insinuated that other people in his department had discussed this. And he just singled me out for a lecture; he hasn't spoken to my colleague who shares the office. And fundamentally, I don't know this dude - he is not in my department, I don't answer to him, and I can see on his badge that he hasn't even been working at the company for very long.

I don't plan to do anything about it - he wasn't OUTRIGHT offensive per se, and at the end of the day, maybe he felt like he was giving me useful advice. But it rubbed me the wrong way.

Ive heard about this both in real life and online, from office workers, security personnel, data entry, receptionists, etc. I've heard of people saying how they're so bored at work, how they spend half their day on reddit or facebook, and some even have to mind to complain about it. Im sure it can be boring if you don't spend that time wisely, but for me, those situations sound like paradise, an absolute fantasy, and long awaited freedom. It would give me the opportunity to better myself, get educated, gain a good skill, exercise my own free will, and avoid having to force myself to squeeze all of that inside a few hour window at the end of the day at home where i have a fraction of the motivation and energy i would have at work. 
So onto my actual question... What jobs usually have this amazing feature of ""free time"" to them? Not careers, take note, but jobs that don't require an advanced degree or highly specialized skill. Are there any types of jobs or job title to look out for that typically have free time or down time or at least a tangible sense of freedom within the work day?",What jobs have free time / down time?,0
"I’m currently a Junior in school. Just recently my professor in my intro to Risk class noticed how well I was doing and suggested possibly switching my second major (Finance) to Risk Management. He said that it would pair well with my MIS major in the professional environment. I’ve been doing some research and just can’t seem to find any actual titles for positions where I could use both my majors. 

I’ve already decided that MIS is to be my primary focus and if I did decide to switch my finance major, I would be taking on a little extra workload to finish in 4 years, something i can handle, just wondering if it’s worth it.

"The other day I got a call from a company and they asked me why I'm looking for a job change so early in my career.

I've been working for 2 years and the main reason I'm looking for a job change is the present company I'm working at,  is going to the dogs, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this, but they are just getting worse by the day.

It's just an altogether toxic environment to work in, so when they asked me why I wanted to change so early I just went blank, and managed a feeble 'Looking for better opportunities' followed by an awkward silence.

"I'm 27F, and I've been suffering from pretty intense depression and anxiety since I can remember. Treatment hasn't helped. On a bad day, I'm sluggish and my memory and focus are completely shot. For the last few years I'd say about 50% of days are bad days.    
I've had three 'real' jobs, two of which were supermarket Deli jobs, and one was phone sales (kind of? I took calls to book window/door glass repairs, ranging from simple to quite complex jobs).  

The two deli jobs were manageable, in that I showed up every day and did well enough that they didn't want to fire me. They were hard work, but repetitive enough that I had a rhythm going and could mindlessly get through the bad days. Plus, they started in the afternoon, which meant it wasn't hard to wake up.    
However, I hated them, and my mental health grew worse.  

The one sales job was a disaster. Getting up early meant I slept through my alarm frequently and was late, and sitting at a desk all day meant I fell asleep at my desk at least once a day. I also struggled with the flexibility of the job, each 'sale' or 'job' was different and that meant I had to adapt often, which I am no good at. I was fired after 6 months.  

    
I've left the most recent deli job and my family is currently pressuring me to find a job that I will enjoy, or at least one that will not negatively impact my mental health. They're also encouraging me to study something.  

That sounds great in theory, and it's not like I **want** another job just like the last ones, but I just can't imagine what kind of job would be 'good' for me.    
I wouldn't mind the idea of studying if there were anything I were actually interested in, but nothing interests me enough to want to deal with it 40 hrs a week. I don't have any hobbies anymore. I am occasionally interested in things (e.g. had a few months where I was into psychology and read a lot about it) but it passes.

"When the subject is on ""worthless degrees"" (using it in quotations, because it might offend some people who actually don't think it's worthless), I often just see people flat out telling other people not to major in them or folks who are trying to defend a certain degree that's deemed worthless.

Because, there are people out there that don't know how to make use of their degree, therefore rendering it as useless. What sort of actions should they take?

"I'm from WI which is an at-will state. I got hired on for 3rd shift last year and it was awesome; it's only the 2nd job I've ever liked (8 in 15 years) . However around May 1st we had a fire and the place shut down for remodeling. This became a long process in which we were constantly strung along by getting ""updates"" saying ""next week"", etc. It basically became a running joke in our house. A week ago, after **5 months** of the place being closed they told us we would come back to work this week! I was ecstatic! I love this job and I was on unemployment the whole time. However, they told us they'd be dropping 3rd shift, so I would be on 2nd shift (new hours from the old shifts).

When I asked our two managers about changing the schedule around a bit the **first** response I got was ""It would be sad to see you go."". I...am baffled. It's not about ME, they love me, it's about them not wanting to give up what they've got. We have 3 employees and 2 managers, the 3 employees will cover EVERY shift themselves, meaning one has to do a split shift (2 days, 2 nights) which is rough. The 2 managers and the other employee (whose been there 15+ years) get to stay on their same schedule. The other girl has the split shifts and I have her old shift so it's completely changing for both of us: in days off, in times worked, and in day rotations (I was 3/3). 

The last couple days we've been cleaning, restocking, and getting things ready for the Grand Re-Opening tomorrow. So yesterday one of the higher ups was here and I told her that I had some ideas for a new schedule. I gave her my printed out spread sheets of hours/days/schedules and she really seemed to be interested.

I was also notified that an external firm will be doing a background check. I was told that it included a criminal background check and reference check. I have no issues or concerns about a criminal background check, but am worried about the reference check for the following reasons:

1) My most recent employment only lasted for 3 months, from february to april. On my resume, I listed my employment there as from January to May. The way I saw it, I signed the papers of employment end entered the contract in January, so that was valid even though I started work in February. My last payment date was in May, so I figured it was fair to list this too. I was dismissed as a part of a cost saving initiative, but since I was on my probationary period, they were able to relieve me of my duties under the term ""dismissal""
2) My title in that position was a very broad ""generalist"" title, so I created a more specific, in-tune title for the resume, similar to changing ""IT Analyst"" to ""Business Process Analyst"". I did this to give potential employers a more specific view of what I was doing.

"I currently live in upstate NY and my goal is to live in either Raleigh or Rocky Mount, NC. Part of it is that the type of work I'm after is more abundant in central and eastern NC, part of it is that I'm done with my current area and living off of menial jobs. I have not gotten any offers from employers in the cities I want to work in, though I have had a couple interviews to no avail. I imagine that my distant makes me somewhat unappealing coupled with the fact that it's mostly entry level work I'm after.

For the past year, I've been playing catch up and have been mostly living paycheck to paycheck.

Sumarry: I tried turning down the offer3 times, the HR lady kept coming back to me with a better offer. Everytime I let her know how this job isn't better than my current one. She approaches me with a better offer. They give me better benefits, $2 more money (after new benefits employee contribution) and a sign on bonus. The only thing is this is still a temp for hire 1 year before converting full time. Though this may happen sooner.

I'd like to approach my current boss with this info because I do wanna stay where I'm at. I'm not really looking for more money. but more responsibilities. I can do the main responsibilities of my job. I've mastered them. I can do them pretty quick, most days I don't do anything. Maybe 1 hour out of 8 working hours. I wanna do more.

I thought they finally got back to me so I was ecstatic and corresponded happily with what I now know is probably a bot or someone who's not even in my country due to how bad the english got as I started asking more direct questions. person sends me a form asking to fill out basic information including address, phone number and a few references. luckily i live in a building and my first and last name is really common so i don't think i gave any identifying info. i sent it back and without word, they said i ""got the job"". no interview, not even a phone call. 

the thing is, the forms looked professionally done. the position exists (although for a LOT less than what they offered me) AND the HQ existed to. the ""hiring"" manager's email looked real too. the suspicions arose because i didn't get a clear description of what the job was. it was super vague and even though in the initial email they said that i would get an in-person interview to determine if they'd extend an offer.

so now i'm stuck wondering what they get out of this? what was their end game? even if i had signed the ""employment"" offer, what could they do? on the other hand, could something happen to my computer for opening and downloading the PDF form?

"Hi all - 

I'm only about a month or two into job hunting and had an interview for an interesting job this past week.

The first half hour was a test on the assistant's computer. It was distracting to complete the assignment because I was seated right next to my future boss's office and she was having an argument with a lower staff member about whether the girl understood something or not. It completely turned me off, but there's a chance I'm being overly-sensitive because I left my previous position due to a superior who constantly spoke to me in a belittling way.

I performed extremely well in the interview - it lasted an additional hour -  and I have been invited for a second interview just a few days later. The job is close to home, the pay is a big step up, and I'd likely learn a lot. The cons are that the whole team is just myself and this other person, I'm not super excited about the field (although it's tangentially related to my field) and I kind of wanted to get away from small nonprofit chaos.

I'm not in desperate need of accepting a position right now, although it'd be nice to have money coming in soon. I saved up to be unemployed for a while. Would this experience be a red flag to you right away, or does the opportunity deserve more thought?

I told them that I resigned (which is true). Instead of saying that I was asked to resign, I told them, it was a government position and a 2 year contract.

"I'm being paid by the hour at a Math Learning Center (Math Instructor/tutor that introduces math topics/fill in the gaps of education that students acquire over the years) and I've been assigned to make a Calendar/newsletter every month.

"Hi everyone, I'm in my early 20s and my current job is my highest paying salary yet. I've worked here full time for almost a year now, it's a small company and I'm the youngest on the team by almost 10 years. The company is still in its growing stages but is definitely secure, to give you an idea, the revenue this year is almost double compared to last year. My daily responsibilities are not exactly aligned with my skills and interests but close enough to where I accepted the job. 

Unfortunately, it's now getting to the point where the workload at my desk is becoming extremely overwhelming and effects the quality of my work. I made a few minor internal mistakes due to this and ever since then, I've been constantly micro-managed and coached. Prior to this, I brought up the idea of organizing priorities and possibly creating dedicated departments to manage the work coming in. My manager's response to this was that they see the company staying small forever because of the way the culture is. As a result, I'm constantly scrambling between various different projects and tasks. To give you an idea, I only work directly with one other person, not including my manager. My coworker has different responsibilities but we help each other out with data entry and emails. After all of this, we got into the habit of constantly sharing our workloads with each other to delegate who can pick up tasks. I share my long list of projects that I'm working on and I'm still given more data entry tasks after sharing 10+ things on my plate.

I'm thinking about updating my resume and searching for something more aligned with my interests, and higher pay would be a big plus. To give some background, most of my experience has been freelancing but I do have a couple years of corporate experience as well. Has anybody been in a similar situation? I don't want to quit until I have something lined up.","Workload is overwhelming, thinking about finding something new",0
"A little background... I come from a tech background (Help Desk type stuff which ranged from staging PC’s, troubleshooting network issues/outages, managing IT vendors and improving the ERP system). My role morphed into a Business Systems Analyst type role where I would gather requirements for a system improvement and implement it myself if it could be done in the front end or work with the development team). 

I left the company of 9 years where I had grown into this role and started at another company, doing exactly the same thing with the same system. 

After 2 years there, I was laid off, landed a job in a different industry that didn’t work out but am now employed in an industry where I have the most experienced with (to an extent) but have zero experience with the system. I’m in a Business Analyst Role with less technical responsibilities and have been in this role for 3 months now. We are also at the beginning stages of implementing this system, a stage I also have little experience with. 

My responsibilities are much different than what I’ve had in the past but I haven’t had much issues since I’d either done something similar at one point and/or just catch on quickly. 

My problem is that what I do never seems to be enough or I’ve overlooked a piece. As a result, my boss is constantly following up with, “Did you also do this?” or “Did you check this?” At that point, I am able to do those things without assistance but I’m feeling inadequate because of it. My manager is a no-bullshit kind of guy and can be very blunt and so it’s been tough for me to gauge whether is an issue with him or not. 

Any advice?",Feeling inadequate a work,0
"I worked in an extremely toxic work environment for a small nonprofit for 2 years. Without going into too much detail: employees were underpaid and overworked, generally mistreated and disrespected by wildly inappropriate leadership, no HR department and concerns weren’t taken seriously, everyone was expected to be available and answer their phones at all hours, etc.

When I was first hired full time, my entire team (plus a few more employees in different departments) was comprised of employees that started as interns. I had been one as well. At first, it seemed like a good sign to me - a company that invested in its interns and trained them properly for employment, valued their work, and wanted them full time, right?

I learned quickly that instead, it was more about enticing interns with a full time offer at low-level salaries beneath the market average, or worse: enticing them with contracts instead of salaried positions to avoid having to pay out benefits, but still expecting them to do all of the work of a salaried employee. In fact, the only reason *I* accepted a full time offer after interning was that I had no other offers on the table and needed to pay my student loans somehow!

It was also a sign that they knew anyone coming from outside the organization would take one look at the place, with its extreme disorganization and burnt-out staff, and immediately run far in the other direction. Instead, they relied on the inexperience of interns to become their full-time employees, because interns may not have worked anywhere else before and had nothing to compare this organization with. It was certainly the case with my boss, who had started as an intern and worked there for 7 years, and with other employees too, who’d only ever worked for this organization.

Thankfully, I got out after a couple years, and my coworkers have also moved on to other organizations that actually value them. They’re still getting over the trauma, and just realizing how a good workplace should actually treat its employees - they constantly rave about things that should just be normal practice. Now that huge waves of staff have left this place, through financial layoffs or quitting, the org is scrambling to contract or hire all of its interns at low salaries.

So that’s been my observation. I would hope that hiring interns here and there shouldn’t be a red flag for a normal, healthy organization. But it certainly was at this place, where cheap labor, tough job markets, and the professional inexperience of interns was definitely taken advantage of. Anyone else have this experience?",Potential red flag: when the whole company is made up of employees who started as interns,0

She says that the interviewer really seemed to like her and they got along well. 1 week later she messages them for a follow up about the process and they say she’s one of the top candidates for the position. Apparently there were more interviews and they would be narrowing down the field by bringing in people to meet the staff later.

"I started a job that I generally like, I get along well with my colleagues ,except for my boss. She seems to have decided that she doesn’t like me, and nitpicks the hell out of everything I do. 

For example, I communicate with dozens of factories, keeping track of hundreds of items, reports, and emails each day. Every once in a while, I would miss a piece of information in an email, which is never a big deal because I could simply ask again or clarify misunderstandings. 
Besides, I’ve never made a mistake serious enough to cause monetary losses to my company. She, however, would make a big deal out of it and chastise me for my bad memory and carelessness.

What pisses me off is that I’m not the only one that misses information in emails, everybody does, and she does too(possibly even more often than I do) but of course, she gets away with it because she’s the manager. 

Is there room for improvement? Yes

Is it my responsibility to minimize my errors and be on top of my job, so that my boss can trust what I do?Absolutely

But we’re humans, not machines, and things like these are gonna happen. 

In fact, I think her constant nitpicking is preventing me from doing my best work because I refrain from taking the initiative to do things due to the fear of making mistakes.
And ironically, that anxiety causes even more mistakes and inaction.

Also I'm not the only employee that doesn't like the manager, other 3 employees already quit and they told me was because of the store manager, he is too pushy with sales and stresses everyone.

" I'm am getting a lot of mixed advice from friends and family when it comes to applying for jobs, so I thought I'd reach out to an experienced community.

A few things that make my situation complicated:

* I have been doing distance education for all of high school (basically homeschooling) which I've been told severely decreases job chances.
* I get really anxious initiating social situations. I went to public school up until grade 9 but was still an extremely reserved person even then, which, in some ways, has both improved and gotten worse since starting distance ed. Although, I'm actually a rather chatty person when I'm comfortable.
* I'm 17 and only now looking for work unlike everyone I know who got jobs at 14 - The older the age, the harder, right?
* I only have brief volunteer experience and 40hrs unpaid work experience.

So, here’s the things I’m unsure about:

1. Should I include referees on my resume? I have a few people that I know are happy to put in a good word for me (the supivisors of the place I volunteered). Also, I have a positive reference letter from the CEO of the business I mentioned I’d done 40hrs unpaid work experience at, do I include this on my resume? Or do I just wait for after an interview to supply any references?
2. Do I need to write a cover letter for a casual junior job? If so, what should this include?
3. Given my situation, would it be best I drop in my resume in person? Or email/apply online? I feel dropping it in in person would push past the stigma of the issues with homeschooled kids, but I’m extremely nervous I won’t make a good impression and they’ll just chuck away my resume regardless.
4. I dont have any exciting achievements, whats the best way to sell myself on my resume?

"So 2 weeks ago, i got interviewed at a certain company. Thought it went well, it was very casual and the hiring manager was really easy to talk to. She asked what my expected salary was (because i intentionally left it blank on the app form) and i deflected the question and said im more interested than the work itself since i just recently graduated. Before the interview ended, she told me that for my position she’ll offer x amount. Said she’s just going to need the manager’s approval. So i thought i got the
job. I haven’t heard from her since then.

"Hello, first time poster here, and in need of serious advice. Friends and family don't quite understand the situation that I am into right now so I figured the Friendly Giant of Reddit could point me in the right direction.

I work at one of the biggest agrochemical supplies company in my country for 2 years now as an area technical sales representative, and before that I worked in a smaller similar company for another 2.5 years at the same position, which means that my communicational skills are fairly good and constantly improving due to the continuous interaction with clients. However these skills do not seem to be any help with my manager (whose job I got since he got a promotion due to the many years he has in the company). Although he hired me, starting from day 1 anytime I try to ask him for advice on how to handle a situation with a client or some technical specs of a product he always answers in an ironic way, making snide comments that I shouldn't have to ask such simple stuff, often in front of other colleagues, constantly trying to demonstrate his vast knowledge of the job and exposing my deficiencies (give this man a cookie, he's been doing my job for 17 years, I've been doing it for 4). All this has resulted in me getting somewhat contracted and trying to solve problems on my own, often not having the optimal outcome.

Fast forward to present, each September the company performs a market analysis with each rep, participating Head of Sales, Head of Marketing, Head of Technical, V.P. and my manager. Our complete lack of communication was quite evident in many occasions throughout the meeting, showing that I had misconceptions about certain aspects of the market. What is remarkable is that my manager tried to make it seem that I am not putting enough effort and that I don't reach out to him enough, and I quote ""He is the youngest and most inexperienced member of the company, and still I have employees with 15+ years in the field reaching out to me several times in the day for advice, whereas not a single call from him"". Then and there I realized that him and me are not a team nor will be, I strongly believe that he is trying to cease my employment there.

The question is do I continue to try and show my worth or should I look somewhere else for some better prospects? I do not want to be a sales rep forever and this company has shown me that they have a ""just do the thing"" culture. Also this low-key bullying has really started to affect my self esteem after 2 whole years.","No communication with manager from day 1, reached to a point that he is trying to have me fired (at least seems like it)",0
"I started a new job fairly recently and I'm loving it. My coworkers are wonderful and the work itself is  engaging and challenging.

"Using an alt just in the very off chance my post is recognized. 

Hello everyone, so I've found myself in a bit of a strange situation. I started a new job about a month ago, my first two weeks were training and the following two weeks were doing my duties on my own. I've been told I've been doing very well in my position and now a senior member of the staff wants to recommend me for the position of manager. 

I'm really not sure how to feel about this. I feel like there is so much about the place I work at that I don't know, I've barely gotten my feet wet in my current position. I also have 0 managerial experience. The plan is to demote the current manager (regardless of if I would be replacing him or not) and the aforementioned staff member is going to recommend me for the position. This would also put my in an awkward position since he would still work there and I would effectively take his old job.

So I suppose I haven't actually asked anything yet so here are some questions:

Have any of you been promoted very quickly and how did that play out for you?

Should I accept even if I'm not confident in my ability to do the job?

For managers: Is the workload incredibly higher than when you were a normal worker? (I have graduate school to focus on as well)

I think ultimately I would give it a try, the pay raise is very appealing and I do like my job and place I work at (a first, honestly) and it would look better on my resume. I suppose I'm just looking for some advice here, I'm very out of my element on this one.

I need your advice here - I recently applied for a job and they're going through the credit checks.

"So. I got a job offer this past Friday, and obviously it is contingent upon the background check going through. They also want a drug test. The background check is very thorough and will take 4-9 days. A minor complication for the drug test is that I take vyvanse for my ADHD. I know the whole deal with the MRO and then verifying the test. So the main issue is that I need to start the 21st. They would have rescinded the offer if I couldn’t start that date as that is the last date for their NHO for this month. I am worried that my background check won’t be done in time for that date and my drug test won’t be ready with all the MRO verification.

"Hello, I have received a job offer which is really weird to me. I applied for a Human Resource Assistant position on Indeed. The company responded and told me some details I was wary about. The company has a 10 day probation period that pays $100 per task completed. After the 10 days then I would have to sign a contract that offers a full time position of $1470 per week. Apparently the ""Client"" would give me money directly to complete such ""tasks"". This probation period is an online work space and they say that their office in my location is ""opening soon"".

"So my situation is a little weird, and I'm not sure how to put my experience on my resume without it sounding super weird.  
 So I got hired to do basic website updates part-time for this small private school. Soon after, they hired me to work in their admissions/marketing office and to do their journalism class. I have my associates degree in history, but they figured that would be good enough to teach that class, it was only a hand full of kids, and all we did was write articles and put them together in InDesign. Well some events happened, and now I'm teaching History and English. It's the school's last year being open (long story), and they didn't want to hire anyone else after a bunch of teachers jumped ship.   
So how can I put all that on a resume? Usually, I just leave out the teaching part until the interview and kind of explain what all I do. But I found a job that I really, really want, and part of the job is education (but not in an academic setting), so I kind of want to incorporate my teaching experience onto my resume.

So I posted recently but I’ll recap that quickly: I graduated undergrad in May, interviewed for my dream job in July, got through to the last step (background checked and references checked) but it ended up going to an internal candidate. A week ago, the guy who would have ended up being my boss emailed me saying the position opened up again, and if I was still interested. I said yes, he told me he had a meeting with recruiters from the company and would let me know about next steps soon. The kicker is, I started a new job 2 months ago, when this place rejected me.

NO ACTIVITY (noone has looked at your profile): Active, accepting job submissions, view/edit submission, and withdraw will all appear. It may say something like ""under consideration by recruiter"".

RESUME HAS BEEN PARSED (this means sorted by software, but not rejected): Active, accepting job submissions, and view/edit submission all show, but the withdraw button no longer appears. Chances are very high if you are in this category you have been rejected, but the HR person has not completely discarded your profile, however they have not moved you into final review.

UNDER FINAL REVIEW (top applicant): If you have an indicator such as ""under consideration by [hiring](http://www.indeed.com/q-Hiring-jobs.html) manager"", or just ""view submission"" with a withdraw option present, then you are under final review.

REJECTED (no longer under consideration): If status is active, accepting job submissions and you have ""view submission"" with no withdraw option, and there is no indicator of an interview or hiring manager, you have been rejected. It may also say ""no longer under consideration"".

I use a recruiter and every job hunt app in existence, and have no problem landing an interview.

Everything goes well and the interviewer seems happy, and raves about my experience and what not, but I never get the job.

"Hi all, 

So I’ve been working for this company for about a year and a half. I was a temp employee thru an agency for about a year, left briefly after that because I wasn’t going to be hired full time, then about two weeks later was offered a full time job at my companies other location.

I’ve been full time at the new location for about 6 months, but I’ve noticed I have a rather large amount of free time. 

The part that has me concerned is that they have always had 3 ‘coordinator’ positions, but they recently made someone a coordinator ‘supervisor’ and now there are technically 4 of us. 

Myself and my one co worker have a very light work load with the occasional busy day, but mostly light days.

I just worry that the light work load of two people is something that management may end up seeing as a bad thing and sack one of us. 

On the other hand, my company is paying for me to take a college program to get me a third of the way to my associates. So I take it they like me? 

Please offer any advice you may have, I really want to have a future here with this company.",Is free time a bad thing?,0

"Hello.

I've recently been off work due to depression and stress, I spoke to my Supervisor and manager before doing so, explaining that work wasn't helping my current state of mind due to the fact that I wasn't sleeping (going into work and doing 12hrs on 1hr sleep). My manager was exactly how I thought he'd be, I explained work wasn't helping and all he was bothered about was telling me how he's kept people in jobs, got new contracts and so on.

Let's get to the point. I've recently started back on a phased return awaiting a letter from my Occupational Health at work. Two weeks into this return, my Manager approached me on the shop floor and asked me about my hours, if I'd be comfortable increasing them and I told him I wanted to wait for this letter to see what it said, he told me that she's only a GP and that it doesn't really matter what she put, so I explained that if he's not happy with that, get me to see someone he's happy with and we'll go from there. This is when he started telling me I was defensive, I told him I wasn't been, I just want to see my notes and ensure that I should be fine to go back onto 12hr shifts. After this, he told me that I'm exactly the same as I was before I went off and this absolutely stirred something inside me. Just hear me out; a man who's been off with mental health, spoke to counsellors, had sleeping tablets, antidepressants and so on and he has the audacity to tell me that I'm the same as I was before I went off? In the end it got a bit heated and he walked off. Now of course it got stuck in my head what he said, I lost sleep and got a bit stressed about it, I almost went back off sick but I didn't want to lose money as I've almost had my full sick pay and would drop to half pay.

Now I've had a meeting today with HR and my manager to discuss my hours and increase them (I got to read my letter today from Occupational Health before the meeting), they wanted me to do 9-5 for 5 days a week rather than what I'm currently doing (2 days one week, 3 days another and finally 4 days another week). I brought up that I wasn't really happy with that, as I feel my manager has set me back in telling me I'm the same as I was and shouting at me on the shop floor. Now he's basically told them that I was shouting and getting mad, not him and with noone there to back either up it's basically his word against mine. I was trying to explain that what he's done has set me back, it's not that I don't want to work more hours, just that I don't feel comfortable after what happened. Now this fell on deaf ears and we're having another meeting to try and resolve this, but I know he's going to lie and I have a feeling HR will 'protect' him, so to speak.

In the end it came down to me going on 9-5 and starting it tomorrow (I was supposed to be off the next 5 days) and I'm already stressing out about it. I have a meeting with the works Doctor in 2 weeks time and if she says that she feels I should reduce them due to him setting me back, that's fine, or if I'm ready for my old shift pattern.

As you can tell I'm pretty stressed, I'm contemplating looking for a new job, but worried about losing pay (currently on around £27,500/y which is pretty good) and I'm worried about financial issues as I have a girlfriend and 3 year old daughter.

"So I've been searching for and IT Position as I currently work in Sales. But I have a computing degree. My current job is 15k. 35 hours a week. 9-5 but with two hours travelling daily with £33 a week spent on the travel. 

1st job offer is a ICT Assistant. Its 12k a year 25 hours a week. 9.30am-2.30pm.   
The travel is similar 1-2 hours by bus around £30 per week.   
The staff are very forward and open, lovely atmosphere no high turnover of staff.

The bonus about this job is I could get driving lessons from the school home in the afternoons (cutting the costs of travel down) and also the option of overtime. Not only that I only work mostly term time, they expect only 25 hours of out of term time the whole year. Then once I have my license and a car its a 10 minute drive. 

The 1st job also offered me a full time offer to take immediately but no buses run to be in at 8am nor was it the job description I applied for. I could do it, it's within my skills hence it being presented. But the fact they offered a full time position at the interview really impressed me. They also mentioned after the probation period it would go up the 13k then possible full time on 20k a year. I care more about the team then the money in the long run.

2nd Job- It's in my town a 20 minute walk. Its shift patterns 4 days on, 4 days off. 7am-3pm then 2.30pm-10pm. Again able to earn my drivers license with the shift and the 4 days off. This is 32 hours per week at 20,500k salary. But the vibe of the overall company isn't as friendly or open as the school. I'll have to work weekends sometimes due to the 4 on 4 off situation and they'll be less holiday, expectations for flexibility and last minute cover. 

They have long time staff and potential for progression but that is  what my current job promised when I took the job I was then told there wouldn't be any not till a year (least).

I wish I was money driven but I'm just not. When I have a good team to work with and a decent boss to help get the deadlines and work done. I can stay with a company and progress for several years. Honestly, I tend to move on from jobs due to new management that can't take responsibility for mistakes and solve them.

P.S For those curious I want to leave my current job because I caught a big mistake of an order done by my boss. She wasn't happy I spotted it and I wanted to fix it before it moved on and payment was taken from the client. She was on the ""I hope nobody noticed it and I can blame it on someone else when the customer notices"" train. Which I cannot STAND.  
I was trained by previous supervisors to check, double check, prevent big mistakes and solve them before it's processed.  It was around 5k the client would be over charged. One of those mistakes the month before caused a lot of tension and bollocking from high ups above (her mistake on a order again). I wanted to avoid it happening again.

So my home location is pretty locked right now. There is no pay increase and I will take a pay hit due to increased travel expenses, gas/repairs/etc. Currently my commute is 20 minutes, so I'm trading it for an hour and in the winter it might be very perilous. Since I am moving in with my girlfriend, my finances will open up a little bit more now that I'm not paying a high rent. The commute is also what I think is low traffic and is down a rural highway, so I dont think that high traffic and jams would be an issue.


The new location is a much smaller site with a lower and hopefully less stressful workload, and under different leadership so I would not have to deal with my current supervisor anymore.



I'm seeing this as a fresh start, but I'm intimidated by the commute, increased cost of travel, and dedicating more of my free time to a commute.

"I wanted to say a big and sincere thank you to everyone on this sub. I've spent the last year reading all the advice everyone gives during my job hunt, and it has finally paid off.

I graduated with my M.A. from a top-tier school in Fall 2018. I had a decent amount of experience, internships, contract jobs in my field, etc., but damn was it still hard as a new grad. I applied to 221 jobs over the course of 10 months. I had 19 phone screenings, 9 phone interviews, 3 video interviews, and 2 in-person interviews. I was applying to out-of-state positions, so they companies had to fly me out for my in-person interviews.

I signed my offer letter today. I'm making 65k + covered moving costs and flexible work hours. This job is my dream position and I am beyond excited. I'm moving to a new city this month and start shortly after.

My biggest regret during the experience were the times I would stop applying to positions because I was over-confident that I was going to get a position I was interviewing for. Definitely a mistake doing that, so if you're still on the grind, don't stop applying. I was offered a position early on, but they offered \~30k with not a lot of chance to advance. That was a hard no from me. I'm glad I waited.

Thank you r/jobs.

EDIT: Just wanted to mention that this company is one had previously told me no for whatever reason, but they called me a month or so later and asked if I was still available. I'm glad I sent thank you emails to everyone after the interview. I think it made a difference.",I just signed an offer letter - Thank you!,0

"I work in a profession where professional references are uncommon because your work tends to speak for itself. (I couldn't find anyone in my network that had ever given out references.) Luckily, I had a few co-workers who knew I was job hunting and okayed references if I had ever needed them. I'm the ""overly prepared"" type of person.

However, Job B has decided to no longer respect my terms of employment and has been scheduling me for Saturdays anyways. I have had to leave Job A mid shift to head to Job B to accommodate these hours and it has been hurting my position at Job A. At this point, my ONLY HOURS at Job A are on Saturdays.

"Hey all,

As the title says, I started a new position about 3 months ago. It’s a salaried position for a small company. I should note that I stayed with my previous employers for 1.5 years, and left to move to a big city and pursue better opportunities. 

Here are some potential red flags:

1. Last Friday I was getting ready to leave and my manager asked in a very rude tone, “What are you doing?” I was confused at the question and replied, “I’m... going home.” My manager then said, “It’s only 4 o’clock.” To which I said, “Yeah, and I got in at 7:30...”  This turned into a 30 minute “talking” which kept me there even longer. Basically, my manager was upset that I wasn’t staying longer but my manager gets in at 10:30 and doesn’t understand that I come in early (which was previously talked about and deemed OK). Nothing was really resolved from the conversation. I just reiterated my reasoning for wanting to work earlier hours due to my commute (which can go up to 1.5hrs each way if I leave during peak times). Just remembering now that I even worked through lunch that day too lol... 

2. The company I work for calls themselves “family.” In fact, a large number of upper management (including my manager) is actually family... I found this out about a week after I started. I’m curious to see what you all think, but I think this is a red flag to me.

Should I dip out now and find something new? I love what I do, but this is looking to be a bad fit for me as far as company culture goes. I’m in a very big city, so finding new work (especially in my field) won’t be too difficult.

"Hi r/Jobs! First time poster, so please let me know if this isn't the right place to post. 

I've been at my current job basically since it opened, about 4 years ago. I'm currently the most senior employee on staff (aside from the owners). When the company opened, it was extremely lax (understandably so), we had only about 10 employees. There were no time off limits and we were able to adjust our own schedules as we saw fit (as long as we made our assigned hours there was no problem). I work in the in-home/school therapy field (for context) and am assigned a certain amount of hours per client per week (usually around 12-15). So if I had an appointment on a Thursday afternoon I was able to stay longer periods the rest of the week to make up for that day. 

The company has grown SIGNIFICANTLY over the past 4 years. Understandably so, limits were put in place when other individuals started to take advantage of it (like moving around their whole week to get every Friday off). We went from no limit to time off, to no limit but excessive requests were monitored, to 5 days of PTO/5 days of UTO (considered your ""sick"" time). We were also blocked out from taking time off for a month around Spring Break, the first and last days of school were blocked out, and you're only allowed to take off time around EITHER Christmas OR Thanksgiving. 

Due to the nature of our field 5 days off a year for ""sick"" time was ridiculous. We work closely with children which are frequently brought in sick so there constantly something going around. So they implemented a ""if you go over you allotted time, you need to speak to the owner to request more time"". 

This past year they added a new benefit for seniority. For each year you have been employed with the company, you are given 1 day of additional PTO (since I've been with the company for 3 full years I was given 3 additional days). This was awesome because next year, my fiance and I are going on our honeymoon to Japan and I wanted to go for 2 weeks.  So when I went to request the time off for next year, I was told that the additional days provided for each year you'd have been working there, was going to be removed. Instead if you've been there 3 years, you'll only receive one additional day and can choose to roll over one day from the year prior. 

So basically, I'm losing two days of PTO. This is infuriating because it feels like I should be gaining more benefits from staying with a company for long, not LOSING, and if feels personal because very few employees are reaching their 3 year mark soon. I'm the only one AT 3 years. 

Has this ever happened to you, or do you have any advice on how to go about dealing with this? I like my company a lot, and would hate to leave it, but honestly this feels very unfair. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

I've been with my company for almost 4 years. The company was very relaxed initially, got bigger and then implemented new PTO/UTO policies (5/5 + 1 day per year there), and are now removing the 1 day per year benefit and instead changing to 1 day per 3 years you've been there with blockouts when you can use your time (1 month blocked out for spring break, first and last days of school blocked out, and can pick EITHER Thanksgiving or Christmas).

"I work at a high turnover firm.

I actually like my boss who I can tell is overwhelmed too. But she can't really address the concerns that my coworker and I brought up. I enjoy being busy and I've worked in another high turnover firm before but this current place really feels like a sinking ship. People are quitting and being fired left and right. It's become worse over the years.

Today, I told my boss again that I'm overwhelmed especially with my coworker on maternity leave. The arrangement while she is gone is just terrible and she even tried to quit a couple of times before she became pregnant. I voiced this to my boss in a nice way. I told her I will try harder since she implied that I'm being unreasonable. At this point, I don't want her to suspect that I'm looking for new work when I start taking PTOs or sick days to interview (if I'm lucky). Being a high turnover firm, management is familiar with the signs of employees trying to leave.

Is there actually anything else that I should do? Part of me thinks I should be more assertive and try harder to have them change the work situation, another thinks it's pointless with all the experienced and new hires leaving.

I'm a software engineer. 

I try to be as organized and methodical as I can. I try to write well written code, I try to set standards, etc.

Sometimes, it bothers me a lot when people just do whatever they like, break a ton of stuff and then I get to pick up the pieces, especially developers who just don't seem to care about the order that has been established to avoid conundrums. 

It's also particularly annoying to have to deal with designers that do whatever they like and don't consider the technical implications of what they're designing. 

The same goes for PMs who think they can just accept whatever the client likes without thinking about what this implies. 

I'm a junior developer, sometimes I feel like some people, especially the higher ups, think that my opinions don't matter because of that. 

At some point, I would like to open my own business. I know that this sort of thing is probably going to be particularly common. 

I don't really know how to deal with this in a good way. For the most part, it starts stressing me out, I push back when I think I should, but lately my manager has floated around the word ""combative"". I dislike that, I'm not being combative, these things are common practices and I'm not one for keeping my opinions to myself, or being a yes man. 

Any advice?",Dealing with other's incompetence?,0

"I am in a sort of unique situation. In March-April ish, I went to quit my job, but my boss talked me out of it and I stayed (read: I am weak) but now since minimum wage went up, I spoke to them about raising my wages (when I was hired, I was offered to be paid at 1.80 above the minimum wage, and they raised minimum wage by $1.80, so I am being paid EXACTLY min wage now), they said they would try to raise it by at least 50 cents and absolutely nothing came of it (raised wages in July, spoke to them beginning of August, it is now mid October).

"Hi all,

I don't know how or what to do right now. I'm now seven months into my new position with a well known company. I love my job, my coworkers, and the type of duties I am responsible for. 

Within a month I have made so many good relationships with my colleagues, including one coworker whom I found out (pieced together from various times so it took a while to realize she was indeed toxic) was considered toxic to the team. Many times she would tell me that our team or whom was toxic or rude to her. Her story is one sided and I know that she may have twisted the story around. However, outside of work or outside of a work relationship, I believe she is a good person. 

She is considered a toxic person because she goes against processes that have already been established and disrupts them, among a few other things. I heard that she was also put on a performance plan and I know it means she will be fired, assuming she doesn't meet those goals that are outlined in the plan. 

I am in good relationship with my own manager, who also works with the toxic/about to be fired colleague. Should I propose that instead of documenting ways to get this colleague fired that we instead help her find a new position at a different company? I say this because this so-called toxic person is my friend and I don't want her to leave the company feeling bitter, if she were to get fired. 

Or should I completely ignore it? To watch/let her get on the performance plan anyway, since the company/team have already placed her on it.

"I have been working at the current company I’m with for 2.5 years as a Jr. QA Analyst. I have dedicated any spare time that I have to teaching myself Selenium with Java. I started using it to automate my testing about a year and a half ago because I was getting tired of manual testing. My manager took notice of this and he moved me to another project to do manual testing and to update their automated testing whenever a new feature was added to the software. About a month ago I had my review where my manager gave me a score of “exceeds expectations”,  but he gave me a couple of goals to hit in order to receive a promotion at the end of the year. However, I have had two previous meetings where he set goals for me to hit to get a promotion in a few months. I hit those goals and I have yet to get a promotion, so I feel like I’m being led on. I haven’t pushed the issue because I know the company isn’t profitable yet. Once one of our projects goes live (in December) and we enter the maintenance part of the contract, the company should have more financial flexibility to give promotions and raises. 

That being said, I’ve been applying to QA Engineer positions so that I’ll at least have some options in case I don’t receive a promotion by the end of the year.

I also talked with the recruiter and he said that the position offers health, dental, and 401k benefits after the first 3 months. The recruiter might be trying to sell me on the position though, so I will ask the manager about the benefits during the interview. It is a 9 month contract to hire position, which definitely carries the risk of short term employment.

"Think I bombed an interview with an answer to a question. 

The question I think that I seriously bombed was “what qualities do you as a leader possess and if we asked your boss, which one would they say you needed to work on?

My answer was in regards to honesty, integrity and communication.  In response to what would your boss say, I answered “he hasn’t provided me an feedback on areas for improvement” because when we do meet for 1:1s, which is rare, he only asks about how the employees I’m supervising are doing and the status of whatever projects I’m working on.

"**Quick note:** Thank you for taking the time to read my post! I am relatively new to the job force (26 years old), and was recruited to my current position right out of college, so I apologize in advance if this is a stupid question! I've never had to navigate this situation, and would really appreciate any advice you can offer :).

\----

Two competing Digital Forensics / Incident Response firms offered me very similar positions at the same time. The recruiters I was working with at each were aware that I was interviewing at the other firm, and that things were heading toward offers being made. 

The base compensation is exactly the same, with the only difference being that Company A offered me a 5k signing bonus and Company B offered a 10k. In terms of benefits, Company A has better benefits (including 100% employer-paid health insurance), but is a bit of a dumpster fire by the looks of it (more info below). Company B has good benefits, but is much more professional / polished, and is lead by some incredibly smart folks in the cybersecurity industry. 

During my interview with Company A, I had the opportunity to meet with the team I would be managing. I was told some concerning things, such as: ""Hope you weren't promised bonuses, because those don't get paid out."" (I was told I could count on ""aggressive bonuses"" around 20 - 30% of my salary (140k)), ""Our clients have no money."", ""We can't hit our utilization."", etc.. These were extremely concerning, and made every red flag in my head go off. Additionally, I felt as though I wasn't asked enough technical questions to make a fair assessment about if I could actually deliver on the job I was applying for... And this is not an entry-level position. It would be at the Manager / Associate Director level, reporting to the Director.

For these reasons, I am planning on turning down the opportunity with Company A, and accepting Company B. However.. here is the twist: I was incredibly confident that I wanted to accept Company A **until I met the team**. I told the recruiter I was working with that I was almost 100% sure I would be accepting if an offer was made... fast forward to now, and I no longer want the position.

I don't know how to kindly, but firmly, say ""No Thank You"" without burning a bridge / having to go into detail about why I don't want the position. I don't want the folks at Company A to get in trouble for saying these things to me, but I also don't want to light myself on fire by hopping into the dumpster with them.

Once again, I would really appreciate any advice you have about how to most professionally / kindly handle telling Company A that I will be passing on the offer. Thank you!",Not Sure How to Reject Job Offer,0
"Right, so I planned a trip a while ago (meaning 3 months ago) to go visit my family abroad. 2 weeks ago a recruiter contacted me about an open position. Had a skype interview and a follow-up call and they liked me well enough to invite me on-site. 

The job sounds awesome and I deffo want it, but they want to meet the week after I go away for 2 weeks. Bummer. I don't want to cancel my trip as it was not cheap and living on my own I really miss my family so the thought of not seeing them depresses me greatly, especially considering if I cancel I might not even get the job.

But you miss all the shots you don't take, right? What if they don't want to reschedule the meeting for 2 weeks when I come back? What if they find another candidate?

"So I find myself in a bit of a pickle and I’m kind of looking for some kind of reassurance or unbiased guidance.

I’m currently searching the job market for something in aviation/aerospace and so far I have had a few interviews and they all ended up as rejections. My current financial situation is almost perfect for where I currently live, meaning my gross income covers all of my bills and leaves a little left over. I am currently retired military and I’m able to live off of what I make without a current job.

I’m being presented with a couple of job opportunities with an aerospace company in Southern California for a job that I fear I am way underqualified for (I more or less lack the experience it looks like they are asking for on the job posting). I could probably learn some of the aspects but I also have a huge confidence problem. I have the fear that if I were to get hired, I would have to move to an area where the cost of living is literally 300% more than where I am at. I fear that I wont be able to do the job and if I get fired, there is zero chance I can live there.

One factor to consider is it would require me to move to a state (California) that I really do not want to move too. The area in question is heavily liberal/Dem and while I am neither of those, politics don’t run my life, but if I can avoid various area, I do.

The pay for the position is likely to be high enough to where I can save up, but there is also going to be a huge increase in taxes compared to where I live including state, and likely moving up into a higher tax bracket.

My family is admit on me moving back but I really just don’t want to as I am actually happy where I am now. I can’t seem to get them to understand and I know in their minds they’re thinking I’m passing up some great opportunities that also get backed-up with the guilt trip.

I’m just really unsure of what to do. Should I go for it and take a huge risk, or stay put and wait for a separate aerospace company to get back with me where I currently live.",Job prospect requiring huge change and risk,0
"I'm in the process for interviewing for a position that I'm very interested in. I had a phone interview with HR, then a phone interview with the hiring manager, and yesterday afternoon had an in person interview with the hiring manager and 3 others from the company. I learned that this is the finalist interview, and there are 3 candidates (myself included) they're deciding between. 

I did not get business cards from any of the people who interviewed me, and the only email I have is the HR person. I'd like to send a ""Thank you"" message to the team - I took away some good specifics of what their goals are for this role, so I'd like to reiterate that I took note of these goals and how I think I can help address them.

Problem: I don't have any of their email addresses, since I didn't get their business cards.

I emailed a thank you to the HR contact for her help in arranging the interviews, and asked if she would be able to pass along the emails for me to express my gratitude to the people I interviewed with. I asked that if she was not able to provide their emails, that she pass along a thank you memo I wrote. I sent that at 8am this morning - we're now at noon and no response. I'm getting antsy. Should I start looking for a way to reach out with ""thank you""s to the team through another channel? If so, my options are:

1. Guess at their emails. I know how the HR person's email is formatted, so I can assume the team's emails are in the same format since I know their full names. Is this creepy if I suddenly appear in their inbox?
2. Send a message through LinkedIn. I'm not connected with the hiring manager, but I did find her page in researching the role. I could send a thank you message in this way.

Or should I stop being so antsy, assume that the HR person will deliver my message, and just wait for the outcome? I don't know if too many ""thank you""s looks desperate and pushy.","Post-interview ""Thank You"" via LinkedIn?",0

"I need some advice about where to move next in my career. There are some life-changing lucrative opportunities (I believe, could be naive, I'm young) in my current position if I choose to stick around, but I've also potentially gained enough experience here that I could go to a competitor, get paid twice as much, and have 50% of the hassle. I also have a baby on the way, due in March.

Background:

I don't have a degree, any formal training, or experience previous to getting into all this. I started in a small marketing firm of about 10 people. The CEO sort of took me in and mentored me into a web development role. I learned extremely quickly and was completely self-taught. Eventually, I managed the whole team under the CEO. In two years I could build websites and mobile apps that worked really well for clients, and run digital marketing campaigns that generated millions in revenue using PPC and Social Media ads. I met with CEOs of large companies, big-time social influencers, some celebrities even and held my own in negotiations and deals. I wrote my own contracts, managed projects from start to finish almost completely independently except some feedback from the CEO, and a team that'd I'd helped hire and train. We ended up picking up a contract for a reputation management job with a company that provides financial services. Mainly credit card processing, gift cards, eCommerce, etc. They were started in 1999 as a sales office for a much larger processing company. They made a ton of money essentially scamming people when the big EMV compliance push came out in the USA (Chip Cards). They had a call center of 50 people, made calls pretending to be their current merchant services provider, offered them a free terminal that was emv compliant, and hooked a deal with a contract (early termination fee attached) to grow a huge portfolio.

Once the big push for EMV compliance died off, the CEO of that company was left shrugging on what to do next, couldn't just call people and scare them for ""not being compliant"" anymore. Also, he'd tarnished his company's reputation online (go figure) and wanted to hire us to fix it.

The CEO of the marketing firm came in and proposed a different plan, a merger between our two companies with a new vision for both companies as a whole, with a complete rebrand. He wanted a more consistent income and saw an opportunity in combining the two main services we both offered (which there definitely is). This was about 3 years ago.

The vision for the new company was more of a Sales Support organization with a separate branch for software development which I hold a 5% equity piece of, which got a big kickstart investment from the CEO, my previous boss became CTO and essentially president of the company. The separate company I own 5% of has not generated any positive revenue since we started, because everything ended up going through the payments company and got lost in the shuffle you could say as priorities shifted and so is mostly forgotten about as an entity, though it does own certain pieces of our software that is being used.

The CEO outside of some feedback and funding has no involvement in our day-to-day, he really doesn't even know what we're building honestly, he just sees the money rolling in and is fine with it.

The CTO and I have completely redone the company, establishing ethical practices for employees and account acquisition, and building the company into a sales support company for outside sales offices. We've built POS applications to compete with the likes of Square, and Clover, and are doing quite well with that so far, but have a way to go still with our relatively small team.

We've got a huge push coming in January with our new point-of-sale software that is going to take us up a big notch.

The negatives:

The admins here are awful. The CTO is a complete jerk. The CEO isn't involved at all except in funding, and spending the money. I've gotten to know the CTO extremely well over the years. He has some chronic bipolar issues, and is abusive to his family. Some seasons are absolute hell working with him. Other seasons are very profitable and full of growth. He's an excellent idea guy, and salesperson. He doesn't have a lick of current technical knowledge but pretends he does (or thinks he does), then shoulders all the work on me. I'm excellent at implementing ideas, managing projects, and have a good head for current technology trends, but I can't come up with a good idea to save my life if it's not related to something that's already in existence. He's been the Yin to my Yang I will say, plus he took me in and gave me an opportunity when no one else would, so there is some loyalty there for me. His ideas are pretty good, but extremely difficult to implement and he wants everything done yesterday. I know it's like this almost everywhere with software (based on what I read on the internet), but I feel it's dialed up to 11 here.

On top of that, I get paid less than half of what someone in my position would make. Now, I don't have a degree, and I didn't really have experience previous so I get it somewhat. But I've seen the numbers coming in, I manage a lot of that too. The stuff I'm building and contributing to this company has made them tens of millions, and once they do a portfolio buyout will result in hundreds of millions. I was getting paid bonuses which helped balance things out to a more fair wage, so were a lot of the employees but they recently took all those away, so now I'm living paycheck to paycheck. I learned it was because the CEO was squandering our money and there wasn't enough left to go around, plus he implemented an extremely unprofitable sales program. I spent a month under the direction of the CTO running numbers and reports to convince them to stop that program, we'd lost over a million dollars on it in 6 months, and our ROI is 3 YEARS not factoring in attrition. Also, the CEO bought 2 new yachts, a Ferarri, a Porsche, a 3 million dollar mansion, and a private jet. Plus monthly upkeep on these things, all going on as company expense. And his wife goes out and does all her shopping on the company credit card. I learned all this within the last month and it's sickening. I've contributed my last 3 years making this place shine, attempting to implement a good culture, establishing teams, team leaders, managers, designers, developers, and I feel like it's been squandered away and like I've been stabbed in the back.

The CTO just learned a lot of this himself as well and feels similarly but is too wrapped up in it to walk away, and has proposed a plan to essentially take the business that we've established since the merger and form a new company out of that, and previous business will be kept entirely under the CEO. That way insane personal financial decisions made by the CEO won't impact the new business we establish. The plan from there is to reinstitute bonuses, better wages, etc. I've levied for a raise to what I call fair wage for what I do (still less than average), but it won't happen until that's done. That was about 3 weeks ago and nothing has moved on that yet, not even a letter of intent.

The positives:

I love the team and the people here. I love managing them, training them, working with them. Almost everyone here I've directly participated in hiring and training and I've been able to give other young people like myself opportunities for a start where appropriate and it's worked out great!

On top of that, the software we develop is my baby. I've poured so much time blood sweat and tears into this thing with my team and we've made something I'm proud of. The latest version of which will be a real gamechanger in our industry.

I don't feel like I have sufficient experience (5 years of project management essentially with both marketing and software, but I wear so many hats), and no degree for the position I'm in even though I'm doing well enough at it. So just that I get to work here and build this experience and lead this team is something I don't take for granted. I could be back working the sales floor at best buy again for $10/hr. Not that I'm saying I don't recognize that I have developed a lot more skills, but if I started applying elsewhere I don't feel like I'd be taken that seriously with my age and resume despite my accomplishments and knowledge of my industry. It'd be almost starting again from scratch unless someone took a chance on me and looked past my lack of formal education.

Where I'm struggling to decide:

I think you can piece together the dots here. The CEO at every turn has felt like he's tried to run this company into the ground, he's thoughtless with finances, careless, and couldn't care less if everyone here lived on the streets as long as someone was here to pick up the phone.

The CTO, while I consider him a friend and practically like family, is an abusive person when he's on a downswing, which is like every other month. I do feel a considerable amount of loyalty to him for taking me in and giving me the opportunities I wouldn't have had otherwise though.

My pay is abysmal for the work I put in, well over 60hrs a week (salary, no overtime), I'm one emergency away from being in serious financial trouble. It was fine with the bonuses, but I'm just barely making it now, plus I've got a baby coming soon.

Our new software will change things dramatically I believe, but it's going to be a few more months and things are so chaotic right now in light of all the recent financial discoveries that I'm not sure we'll all make it that long. We're not the only company trying to get a product out like we have, it's a race right now and we were way ahead, but now starting to see competitors catch up to what we're doing. I also don't want to abandon what I've built. If I leave, that software would probably not be continued and would just be counted as a loss. I'm guessing 1/2 of the staff would wind up being gone too as they'd scale back to just offering sales support and in-house sales as they'd done before the CTO and I came on board.

If I was going to apply elsewhere for positions I'm looking at the following roles: Product Manager, Project Manager, Producer, Consultant, Business Analyst, Systems Analyst. I feel each of these is appropriate for the experience I have and what I've spent that last 5 years doing.

Sorry for the long post, just have a lot to get off my chest and I feel each piece is relevant to making a decision on how to proceed.","Stick with current company for potentially better opportunity down the road, or apply with competitors for better pay now, and less hassle? Warning: long post",0

"Bear with me because this might be pretty long, but I seriously appreciate anyone taking the time to look at this.

So I am a recent spring college grad who has been having some significant struggles finding a job I actually enjoy doing. I earned a degree in Information Systems and Operations Management but honestly have no clue what jobs to apply that towards.

After finishing up at school I really felt the pressure to find a position to start earning money so I could afford rent and stay in the area. I ended up going with a Staffing Agency that put me in a position as a Server Technician. The pay was way lower than what everyone else had been making, and I kept hearing from all my coworkers that there is almost no way to move up if I did get the full-time position. I had a good time there with the actual coworkers and management was not too bad but the position was a lot more physical moving of servers and equipment around, and eventually, it felt like I was just a glorified warehouseman. After only 2 months in I put in my two weeks, said goodbye to everyone at the company and at the Staffing Agency and moved onto another position I had lined up while working there.

This new job I was super excited about. It was in the Department of Commerce, had decent pay and some good benefits and I was going to be working as a Procurement Specialist which sounded quite interesting to me. However, I made the mistake of not asking what the office would look like in my fever to find something better, and gleefully accepted my first ""real"" job. I am now situated in the sub-basement of the building, with coworkers all 55+ who I struggle to relate with. The workload is practically non-existent, and I have tried to ask my superiors for more but they always come back with ""its just typical this time of year"" as the Fiscal Year just ended. My commute is also terrible for how close I live to DC, and even trying to get mentorship from some of the bosses has been more of a struggle than I had assumed it would be.

I am now reaching a point only a month in where I once again have started to hate what I do. I am always wondering what other stuff I could be doing with my time and have actually started to write a novel to occupy myself as it is that slow. I can stick it out for probably another 3 months or so but after that, I really want to move onto something else that is maybe more local. My question is how bad is this going to look on my resume now that I am moving on from a second job in only just a few short months. I read everywhere how doing that with one job after a couple of months causes you to look like a job hopper, which is causing me to feel as if I am now trapped in a job that I hate even more than the first one I moved on from.

"I graduated from college with an anthropology degree last year and am applying to graduate school in medical anthropology now. I have been working at the same job for a year now. My coworkers and supervisors are great people, but the schedule is getting increasingly time-consuming and inconvenient for me considering 1) my current mental health state and 2) what I plan to do long-term. (It is pretty easy, and there is room for growth if I stay, but it would be rather boring until I get there. I don't plan on staying there for more than 6-8 more months anyway, and if I do get promoted soon, I don't want to just ghost them in a few months.) 

I would like to find another job just to keep making money while I transition from one phase of my life to the next. I live with my family and pay $350 on rent and a little less than that on student loans each month. 

Some limitations: 

* I live in a suburb, the bus is my only method of transportation, and the commute to and from the closest major city where I currently work is 1 hour in the morning. It's slightly less if I travel at other times of the day. My usual work shift is 1-9pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and 4-8pm on Sundays. I also take a GRE prep class on Sundays from 9am-2pm. (Fridays and Saturdays are girlfriend time.) 

* I have a bachelor's degree and am concerned about being considered ""overqualified"" for certain positions. 

* I am physically disabled and can't do strenuous physical activity besides *occasional* lifting and regular office tasks. (In other words, no warehouse work.) 

* I want to emphasize planning for grad school, so I am looking for a more part-time or flexible schedule, or the possibility of working from home. 

Some more positive things about me: 

* I have a lot of writing and editing experience under my belt from undergrad. I've presented and published independent research, edited a zine and a journal, and tutored both undergrads and high school students. 

* My current job is in survey research related to healthcare, so I get to interact with people on the phone every day. I also have some previous customer service experience working at a tech support desk in college. 

* The research projects I work on are pretty diverse, so I've had exposure to studies on dementia, opioid use, cancer, genetic testing, exercise, and more. I'm not an expert on any of these by any means, but I might be able to leverage some of this. 

Some jobs I've thought about: 

* Tutoring, online or in person

* Working at a cannabis rec shop (I do not really use cannabis, but my undergraduate research was on the topic, and I live in King County, WA so there are a lot of stores here) 

* Library jobs might be nice and quiet

I interviewed for a ""tech"" position, got offered ""specialist"" position, which is the next step up from a tech. 2 or 3 weeks in, there was a team meeting where it was announced there will be a restructuring and 3 of the 4 other techs in the dept would get promoted to specialist. The job description I signed for Specialist included some stuff I wanted to do regarding data analysis, metrics, investigations and deviations, implementing LIMS, writing SOPs, etc. Specialist JD now since restructuring is a step back - all those duties I wanted moved to Data Management role, which is not my title (the other specialist got the data management role). 

Not only that, the job I am in is way too simple and I am not challenged currently. I am frequently bored and I have not been well trained. Yesterday, a recruiter on LinkedIn for a different pharma company reached out and wants to call me for a phone interview. I am going to do it, but should I just be honest about what's wrong in my current role that I am new in? Would it be a red flag to mention that I feel like I got baited and switched? Should I put this role on my resume even though I haven't done anything super worthwhile? Or 2 month gap instead?

The 2nd company 2017-2019, I got promoted to Sr Tech after 1 year, but they were also going through a restructuring and that also would have scaled back my responsibilities.

I applied for this course through a university that's SUPER competitive and luckily I got in under the circumstances that I have a clinic and someone who is licensed is willing to train me, so I can apply for my license. I asked the clinic a month before applying and they said I could, and gave me a trainer's information. At first I thought I didn't get in because I hadn't gotten an approval letter on time, so I emailed the clinic director telling her I wasn't sure, but then emailed immediately after I found out I did get in to tell her I jumped the gun (I rarely make professional mistakes like this and i'm so upset I did).

"I had the best interview of my life last month. 

I’m currently in a major career shift, and this position straddles where I am and where I want to be: it heavily relies on the skills and experience I have but offers entry level training on where I want to go.

I also really sold it. I had a lot of positive feedback from the panel, including tears from one and a “that was the best answer I’ve ever heard in an interview” from another. 

Here’s the rub:

I’m in school for this career shift. My current, low-paying non-union job has an incredible boss who works with my class schedule every semester so that I’m still pulling full-time hours and getting all them sweet benefits. 

The position I was officially interviewing for is for the smaller satellite branch with less flexible hours. 

We ended on the note that it was more appropriate that I be considered for the more fast-paced branch here at the “head office.” This branch is open 24/7 (Night shift is my jam), so there is tons more flexibility in the available schedule. 

The interview then switched to a conversation about what hours I could work and what my schedule would look like. We ended on a note of” you are an amazing candidate. You are the second person we have interviewed, but we want you on board. We have to talk to the union and find out how and if we can manipulate the schedule in such a way that we can bring you on. It will take a while.”

I haven’t heard anything since.

I'm a semi-recent college grad (graduated \~1 year ago) that got a health science degree and intended to enter the healthcare industry. Turns out I didn't like it, and instead I've decided I want to pursue an entry-level IT job.

"I had graduated with a bachelor's in electrical engineering 3 years ago, but due to unforseen personal life struggles, I'm only now entering into the industrial industry. With my time out of school I knew I would have a hard time jumping right into an engineering position, so I decided to take the service technician route to help rebuild a foundation and eventually work my way into an engineering/design role. It also seemed a great way to set me apart from other engineers by having the hands-on experience and understanding the end-user experience - to then bring those perspectives into the design work later in my career. A lot of people I've networked with have been encouraging of my approach and agree with my career path.

So I'm now in my first week as a service technician for industrial equipment and I initially am feeling somewhat out of my element. I was not given much shop experience from my father or family, as no one in my family had much experience either. And I went to school for electrical engineering, which is largely done on paper/simulation save for learning how to use electrical test equipment. I am currently of the feeling that I lack the mechanical aptitude, as well as the experience with tools. 

However, there are plenty of shop guys that seem to welcome the extra set of hands and are willing to show me a few things. I'm doing my best to learn as much as I can from the shop guys and from the other service members when we go out on a job. I am still soaking in all I can, but I'm still very new to it all, so I'm not sure what questions I should be asking.

My largest concern, is how long until I feel confident in doing this job? This is my first time in an industrial setting and it's been a tad overwhelming at first. My other concerns are what red flags should I watch out for when starting a new career at a company? (things like lack of training, feedback, or set expectations are what worry me)

All in all, I'm glad I took the leap into this position, no matter the outcome I'll definitely be learning a lot about myself and what work would fit me best. And I know to just give it time, it's be nice to hear some other similar stories becuase I know I'm not alone in ever having felt these feelings.","Starting my career: technician to engineer, thoughts and concerns",0

I recently took a part time retail job while on the job hunt, and in the almost month I’ve been there most of the staff has left/put in notice. I had been in discussions with my manger and the district manager about moving up in the company within a month or two (they’re short people, I’m overqualified.)
I get along well with my manager, and feel bad leaving her in a tight spot with the holiday busy season coming up, especially as my departure is likely very unexpected.

My girlfriend started a new job today and red flags are flying left and right. Things were already going off before she took the job, but it seemed like quirky small business stuff and we wrote it off as that (the initial phone call was really weird, and when they offered her the job they did it via text then didnt respond for a day when she asked about pay.) She showed up today and asked about new hire paperwork and was told that wasn't necessary. She brought it up again, and they confirmed again it was not necessary. She has not filled out an I9 or a W4, and they don't even know her actual first name, as she goes by her middle name. They don't know her age, they don't know her social security number. The only thing they know is her phone number, her professional name, and the day and month of her birthday only because they wanted to be able to celebrate it. After talking to her coworkers, she learned that they also  have done an I9 and W4, and they do not have a system for tracking hours. They also do not offer benefits, when up until this point we were under the impression that they did.

"Hi I've been working at this job for around 2 months now and am really struggling to force myself to wake up and go. I was initially hired as a salesman however the boss quickly added new tasks to my job. The company is extremely short-staffed and I was being told to make deliveries, take photos, answer phone calls, heavy labour and just overall being a type of office assistant. This increased workload is really tiring me out and when I tried talking about my salary the boss got really angry and tried dodging the question. I do full-time uni and currently work 3 days a week. However due to the increased workload and relatively average pay I was wondering if it worth staying at the job or just quitting and hopefully find another job later on?

" 

*TL;DR at the bottom.*

I'm having a hard time managing my rational response to some crap at work and it's been lingering for a while now.

Sam and I work at the same company - I'm a project manager and Sam is a specialist in an area that provides support to the whole company. Sams' reputation precedes her, but turned out to be pretty accurate after just a few months of working together. Sam is difficult to work with, lacks attention to detail (in a detail-oriented role) and has become condescending and rude towards me and my team.

I'm in charge of a big project at work; I do big projects like this a few times a year, so nothing out of the ordinary for me except I have less support than I usually would have due to staffing reductions, so I asked Sam to help in her area of expertise.

Think of me as her client, but working within the same company - I ordered a product from her to spec that I have to pay for. She went from being somewhat pleasant to being downright rude and condescending when I politely, but firmly, pushed back on the product design when it wasn't what I asked for. After some back and forth and her refusal to take any of our feedback, I told her we'd find someone else to do the job if she wouldn't (my boss was in full support) and she responded that she was doing it anyways without our approval and she'd bill us later for it. My boss told me to let Sam screw it up, we'd deal with it later.

As the project moves forward, it's become really clear that Sam is just plain lazy. She's had a number of public facing screw ups in her area of expertise, we have to spend time double checking everything she does and we're already redoing a bunch of her work that's gone out publicly to thousands of people because it was wrong. Her mistakes reflect poorly on my team because we're the face of the project. My boss is aware and isn't impressed either, but Sam doesn't report to her. Boss has plans to talk to Sam's boss, but I'm not confident anything will come of that conversation.

Sam's condescending attitude and speaking down to me because she's the ""specialist"" is what's nagging at me. I've known for a while that she's not a specialist at all. She's just someone who was handed a job because her father worked for the company and demanded a job for her. As far as I'm concerned, if you get handed a job and you can show up and can excel at it, you've earned that job. But she's just plain bad at what she does; I don't have any respect for her or the work she does at this point. I'll always be professional and practice civility. I don't have to like or respect you, but you don't need to know that.

This whole thing is weighing on me. I take a lot of pride in my work and presenting a polished final project and her pushy, condescending attitude and sloppy work are making it harder for me to do that. I turned the other cheek when she became rude and condescending with me, but I really wish I'd told her that I didn't appreciate her attitude towards me and that I deserved some respect as her peer and the person managing the project. It sounds easy writing it here, but I didn't have the balls to put those very words into an email and hit send. I'm up for a promotion and while I fully deserve it and I've earned it, I don't want to do anything to jeopardize it in the heat of the moment.

I WANT to let this junk go. I WANT to move on and stop thinking about this, but the entire thing just grinds my gears. I can move on and focus on other things at work, but as the project is ongoing, she pops up at least once or twice a day - and with each pop up comes an air of condescension riddled with more mistakes and it just irks me more and more.

How do I let all of this roll off my back and stop caring about her crappy work? How do I continue to deal with this coworker as the project continues without letting her under my skin? I need to build up a thicker skin to junk like this, how do I do that in a professional way?

TL;DR: ""Specialist"" coworker is refusing to listen to my/my project teams wants and needs, is being condescending towards me and is putting out sloppy work that reflects badly on my team. Regret not telling her off in the moment, but can't seem to let it go as it drags on.",Difficult Coworker and Letting it Go,0

"I have worked in my industry for almost 10 years, always been a salaried employee working 9-5 and pretty happy where I worked. Recently my husband and I moved to a new area so I had to find a new job, I saw the position I'm in now and jumped on it. I needed a job and they seemed desperate for an employee, the pay was good and I was told it was the standard 9-5 as most workplaces are. And plenty of work to go around. I have a lot of appointments with the VA. I told them about this when they offered me the job. I always make an effort to make them after 3 or before 8. So I never miss that much work and if I do it's not more then 3-4 hours every 2 weeks. I've been working here for months and getting great reviews from all the leadership. 

But suddenly this past 2 weeks I have gotten nothing but toxic and snarky comments from the leadership directed at me. Suddenly questioning if I had completed tasks I had already completed or wondering why I was leaving at 5 instead of later. This turned into them asking me if I could work 8-5. I know this isn't out of the ordinary for some employers at all but it was the way they asked me. As if I wasn't getting my work done when I was completing all the work by the deadlines.  And it wasn't what they originally told me. I told them I can do 8-5 but it may change some days because of my appointments. They said thats fine and to just let them know when they were. I continued to do this and then got a very almost threating to fire me email yesterday morning from my CFO. 

Saying that he doesn't see a constant work effort from me and that I should be putting in just as many hours as him, But I'm not even putting in 40 some weeks. Not only is he the CFO, which I think has a VERY different array of job responsibilities than my job. But I always hit at least 40 hours unless I have my appointments. Which I explained to him. He then ghosted me and pretty much acted like we never had that conversation. 

Then this morning, among all the snarky emails in my inbox questioning if I had completed tasks that I have already completed weeks ago. Was an email from him that says if I have an appointment I need to make sure to work those extra hours in the next day. So if I leave at 3 I'm expected to stay until 7 tomorrow? The office doesn't even stay open that late. The earliest I can come in is 730, which with my commute isn't happening. So I'm left wondering what they expect of me? I'm a salaried employee who makes the salary even if I come in for 10 minutes and then leave. So I cant take PTO for my appointments unless I was gone for a whole day. So I can't use my PTO but I also can't make up these hours some weeks. I'm just wondering what I'm left with here? I've been applying for new jobs ever since I started getting those prying emails 2 weeks ago. No bites yet, and I don't want to quit this job if I don't have to, it pays well and isn't a bad gig.

I have a few friends who work for the company and I’ve asked them for insights on how they got their job and they didn’t have half as hard of time as I seem to be having. They all got their positions straight out of college with essentially no experience and have been able to work their way up.

"I’ve recently started a new job and realized a week ago that it just isn’t going to work out. I took it on because I was recently laid off when my previous store closed permanently and took the first job offer I was given because I was uneasy about being unemployed for too long. I’ve realized I’m heavily overqualified compared to my coworkers, my manager is extremely under qualified, and she micromanages poorly and aggressively. On top of that my manager speaks very basic English (foreign based company and she was hired after recently immigrating because she’s friends of the owners family) so I can’t even have a conversation with her about my grievances, she understands very little outside of basic statements. 

I’ve come to the conclusion I have to leave without giving notice for the sake of my sanity but I’m extremely anxious about doing so. I’m in the position where I can just leave this job off my resume as it will be very short lived, so I’m not really concerned about any backlash on that end. Part of me wants to not show up, but I’ll feel horrible for my coworkers that have to pick up the slack, the place is incredibly understaffed as they can’t keep people on, for obvious reasons. I feel like my the only route is to tell my manager I won’t be returning the following day to at least give her time to staff accordingly the following day or come up with a game plan.

I have no clue how to go about this or what to say. I’ve never been fired from a job and every other job I’ve left I have given more than two weeks notice and left on extremely great terms.

So I have about a month and a half left but am trying to decide how much notice to give my employer. I only say 3 because my position is specialized and only one other person in my department does it so it’d be a lot to handle for one person, and I feel like an extra week would give them some more time to find a replacement?

My points of contention are that I am a west coast guy and I am not that interested in relocating to the east, and I certainly would see myself moving on from that company within 1-2 years.

1. Decline the offer, and still be able to use my contacts at the company in question as references to help me get a different job, or
2.

And if another offer doesn't come, I'd just settle for working there for a year or two.

There are a few VPs/SVPs at my company who've worked for some of the firms I'd eventually apply for. I would love to talk with them: pick their brains on the sort of work they've done, ask about how they've translated their experience to their current work, and solicit advice on the application process at their old firms. Ideally, I'd like to build up a relationship with them to the point where they can help me get my foot in the door. Problem is, naturally, they are pretty far up the corporate ladder, and neither my manager or director know them well enough to introduce me.

How should I approach these individuals? Is it inappropriate to try and do so in the first place? My company is **huge** but very open - it's not unheard of to email the CEO and get a response - but I've never been great at building relationships and am not sure what sort of balance to strike when talking to somebody in this situation.

I strongly feel this career shift is right for me, and networking is the best way to get to the interview stage, so I see this as my best option at the moment. Any and all advice is appreciated!",How to network with VPs/SVPs as an entry-level analyst?,0

"I graduated in Spring 2017 with a B.S. in Financial Analysis from a non-target. I've been in the real estate industry since senior year in high school (2011), worked through college, and shortly after graduation I became licensed as a real estate broker and opened up my own small business/brokerage. The last 2+ years I've spent growing/working/managing the business and it is at a stable point now where I can take a step back and explore other opportunities, while still being able to manage.

I'm 26 years old and I would like to utilize the degree that took me years of effort to achieve, as well as work for a company with a social network of other young, intelligent individuals. I think having a social network is very important, especially in the beginning stages of my professional life. Question is, should I focus more-so on relevant coursework &amp; skills learned in college on my resume (which may be a tad more difficult to do considering I haven't touched the material since graduating), or would it be more advantageous to try and relate the skills I have acquired through my work experience to the jobs I am applying for (also ""difficult"" because the fields and work done is different)?

Maybe this is all in my head, but my aim is to make it clear on the resume that I have the required educational background to perform the necessary job functions even though I took a less traditional route after graduating. My concern is that hiring managers will see my work history and decide, based on that alone, that I am not a good fit. I will be reviewing my coursework for any technical questions I may be asked, but from what I hear, entry level position interviews are typically more behavioral since employers understand the lack of work experience. I'm just in a weird place where hard skill accumulation is limited during college, and hard skills gathered from my previous work history have to be manipulated to relate to these positions and may or may not be viewed as applicable.

"I've been getting coached and micro managed constantly at my current job. This all started when a few minor (or so I thought)  internal details were missed by me. After this happened, I had a few informal meetings with my manager about ""what's going on?"". I went on to explain that the volume of work coming in is impacting the quality of my work as I can only do so much in a day (this is a very small office btw). I mentioned that I try to be as detail-oriented as I can without impacting the deadlines of my projects and tasks. It's at the point where I can't afford to be as detail-oriented, as I would like to be, because there is so much to do. I try to organize everything on my plate and my list is usually very long, most of the time I even skip an hour of lunch break to finish my work in time.

It's funny because this manager has always given me weird vibes ever since I started this job. It almost feels like all of my work is magnified x10 compared to my coworkers.

"I got let go from my job in March 2018 after working in that position for a year. Before that I had been in various accounting positions for over six years.

I was not a good fit and on top of that the supervisor did not seem to like me after I made a mistake on the first 6 months of the job.

So after 2 months of not getting anywhere in my job search, mostly due to people wanting me to have more of an accounting degree (I graduated with a BBA in Finance) I decided to go back to school to get my remaining 30 hours to be CPA eligible. I decided to do it full time as I only had a little over a year to complete it and did not see a point in dragging it out over 3/4 years like some people.

I went to school and lived with my parents as they offered to let me live with them so I would stop draining my savings, and I graduated with a 3.4 GPA this past Summer. I felt so proud of myself as this was the first time I have ever done this well in school. I became CPA-eligible this past August. 

I figured with the good grades and constant networking, things would improve from the prior year.

Well it's been roughly four months since I graduated and I have submitted well over a 100 applications and been on over half a dozen job interviews and I am still unemployed. I feel like I am nowhere closer to having a job than I did when I was let go over a year and a half ago. 

It's just so frustrating to feel like before I was not getting a job because I did not have a bachelor's in accounting, or enough upper level courses in accounting, and now it's because I have been out of a job too long (that is my assumption).

My parents, understandably, are losing their patience. My Mom actually screamed at me this morning how they can't move because I am holding things up. 

I'm honestly feeling like a complete failure. My Sisters and friends lives seem to be getting better and I feel like I am worse off than I was when I graduated college in the heart of the recession.

Some people are telling me to just pass one or more sections of the CPA exam and then the jobs will line up. Well, by then I might be two years out of a job. Who is going to want to hire me then?

I've considered getting my server's license and start waiting tables even though I feel like that is not a good use of the all time I put into school and I do not have any server's experience.

"I've encountered a situation that has me scratching my head a little bit.  Was wondering what you all might think of it.

I took on work as a contractor for a large company in a different city with a higher cost of living.   Said contract was under a year with a few perks extended to me due to special circumstances.

When one of the perks for relocating were set to expire, almost halfway through I was offered the opportunity to continue the work back in my home city.    I did so and have been working there for a few months.

I learned that the company planned to bring on 4 or 5 people in my same exact role, and they were using my resume as the archetype for the job search (I originally learned this when two separate recruiters called me about this same job.   
 This was confirmed by my managers).     About a week later management brought up the topic of contract renewal.

I am being offered a new contract doing the same exact job, but at a lower rate.  It is a 28% cut in pay.   It was implied that the change in locale was part of the calculus for the lower rate.  I was explicitly told that the rate they were offering was higher than what would be offered for the contractors they plan to bring in.

"I recently changed jobs as a result of moving to a new city, but I am on good terms with my previous employer &amp;amp; supervisor. My previous supervisor reached out on behalf of the company to see if I’d be interested in extra work.  I’d be doing design work and drafting for an engineering company. 

He mentioned that I’d be able to use my old computer, and they are offering my old rate at time and a half. I’m assuming I’d be a contractor, so I’d have to file a 1099 for my taxes for this work. I’d be working minimum 8 hours a week. I enjoyed the work I did at my previous company, so this extra source of income seems to be a win-win to me. I responded that I’d be interested, and I’m willing to work out the details that need to be discussed. 

My questions to those who may hold more experience/ knowledge with situations like this are: 

Does this seem worth it? I have no experience with being a contracted worker and filing a 1099.

Is 1.5x standard pay typical for contracted work, or should I seek a little more to help with taxes?

Should I list this on my resume, or would it look bad that I was doing work for two companies at the same time?

"I started my job in early December of last year. Before hiring me (an out of state applicant) the position was open for 1.5 years. Since starting, I have been responsible for cleaning up the mistakes made because the job duties were bounced between half a dozen people and a lot of things were done incorrectly. I have worked hard and received positive reviews and two raises. I love my job. I love it more than any job I have ever done and would do it until the day I die. It challenges me, it gives me an opportunity to grow career wise and I like who I work with. 

My SO lives in another city, 2.5 hours/190 miles from the one where I currently live. He has a pretty specialized field for our region and there is not a job for him in my town (only 14k people in my city). My lease is up in a month and I have to tell my boss that I intend to move away. I have been holding off because he was waiting for a response on a job out of state and depending on what happened it would change what I said to my boss. I work for the state Government, so there are some opportunities in his city to stay with the state, but the bulk of positions are available in my city (the capitol). I do accounting, which is all handled from my current office. We do not have any remote positions in our department. 

My plan was to ask for the opportunity to do a split remote schedule. I would work one week in the new city at the local office and then do a four day week in my current office. By doing this, I would just book a hotel for three nights every other week. I've thought of the logistics for getting some of my day to day stuff done and have a plan for that. I plan on using the fact that my position was open so long and the work I've done rehabbing as a reason to allow me to do this kind of schedule. I like to think I can handle this conversation with professionalism, but I know I am prone to crying. Just thinking about having to ""let him down"" when I tell him I'm leaving makes me tear up. My boss likes to talk about how we will do things in the future and the kind of changes we will make. It eats me up inside because I feel like I am leaving them in the lurch. Most people here take a job and they stay at it for years and years. And I really have to tell him today since I am down to the wire and have at best six weeks before I will be gone. 

I know if I don't get to keep my position, I have options, but I don't want to go through the hiring rigmarole and deal with learning a new position, change in benefits, etc.

"Hi r/jobs,

My girlfriend and I are currently saving to travel for around six-months in just over a year from now. I'm currently miserable at my job, so I will have zero issues leaving. However, my major concern is leaving my job, travelling, and coming back to a whole lot of nothing. The idea of not leaving my job, especially to travel and do what truly makes me happy, terrifies me more than the prospect of returning to nothing. So regardless, I'm going to do this thing.

I'm currently 28-years old, I've been working in Marketing / Communications for a number of years, and I have three degrees. I would say I have a decent amount of experience and haven't had many issues finding work in the past. But, I know not all offices/organizations look at long-term travel the same.

But, I don't want to be oblivious to the realities that come with leaving a job. So my questions are -- especially if anyone has done the same -- how does it look when you return back?

I received a job offer this morning and believe I will be accepting the position. I have an interview tomorrow and a second round set up for Friday in addition to a phone interview on Thursday.


This offer is for a company that I was really excited to work for and in a great location. The second round interview is probably my number 2 choice since the location is not as ideal. The other interviews are not the best fit for the next steps in my career.


There isn't set date for accepting the offer, but I understand that it is best to respond within a week.

"To make a long story short, I'm quitting my current job in Southern California because it is unbelievably toxic and my coworkers treat me awful, my boss is lazy and puts all her work on me.. the list could go on. I'm moving to Salt Lake City, UT with my boyfriend (It's gorgeous there, I fell in love immediately and i've never been happier with a decision to move.)   
My current job is in broadcasting/radio. The industry runs in my family and my dad is a huge bigwig in it. I have a connection in SLC with a BIG broadcasting company there (100x bigger than my current job) and the position is higher up, pays better, and is RIGHT up my alley. i loved it.   
I applied, my dad even put in a good work, and they emailed me back for an interview. Unfortunately, the only times they were available to do the interview was.. while im at work.. so I schedule it for my lunch break and had to sit in the empty conference room of my current job with the door closed and do the phone interview. The interviewer was so nice, he sounded young and very kind. we hit it off fast. but he kept throwing curveball questions at me and i think i was nervous and stressed about SITTING at my current job doing this interview that i am scared i answered them inappropriately or that they were a test and I failed...

most of the questions were super great.. ""why do you want this position"" ""what makes you think you're a good fit"" talking about my current job and what i do... my experience... etc etc.. we even joked about why I'd leave southern California and go to Utah of all places. But then he said ""did you look at our websites?"" and i said ""yes!"" which i did, of course, but it wasn't like i studied them.. i just looked at them.. navigated around.. moved on.. maybe 10 minutes bfore the interview. anyway, so he asks if i looked at them, i said yes, an dhis next question was ""is there anything you would change? what would you suggest we do?"" and.. surely this was a test to see my creativity but i panicked and the last thing i want to do in an interview is critique my interviewer's work! so i said ""i think it looks great! i love this this this and this"" etc. but i definitely, in my mind, have suggestions for it. but i was too nervous to say them!

and another thing, he said ""how much are you looking for pay?"" and i was always told not to say specific numbers i want. so i said ""I would like to work full time."" and he paused, and i hesitated and nervously asked ""do you mean numbers?"" and he said ""yes"" so i told him ""im honestly happy with 30k"" and i just felt so juvenile and scared and nervous. going into this position i was nervous i am too young for it. im 21, and it's for a promotions coordinator. so when i said that i just felt like i absolutely failed. the rest of the interview i was so nervous that i kept messing up.. that i continued to keep messing up. did i screw this up royally? he even asked if i had any questions, i said no. his parting words were that he gave me his number, email, and asked when i could start, and that they will be making a decision this week. 

i ended the interview by shooting him an email thanking him for his time and consideration and.. that's that. i guess i'll know this week but.. i cant stop thinking about how much i screwed up my dream job.",nervous I messed up on my interview.... I need some input and reassurance,0
"Before I got my current job I was job hunting for over 9 months. I finally accepted and offer for $16 and hour as an admin clerk in contracts for an aerospace company. At around 6 months I had a performance review and was recommended by my boss to apply for a planner position. I interviewed and I’m still waiting to find out, but I do know they only interviewed 4 people. It was awkward as heck because I somewhat worked with the three interviewers. It sounded positive from what I’ve heard, but I’m still weary due to all the rejections from my initial job search. If I don’t get it I will definitely go to school. 

Before I knew about this opportunity I had applied to a local private university and planned on finishing my BBA using my GI bill. Well, I’ve now been accepted and had 70 units transfer from classes I had been taking online. I got my Associates in Business before I got out of the military and was about to get a Bachelors but I got my job and put it off. I have always wanted to go to a real school because I feel like a fraud with my current education, not because I feel as though I didn’t learn enough but because of the stigma I associate with online classes. Before this new job opportunity going back to school made sense because I would make more using my GI Bill than I would if I continued to work. But if I get this new job I think it could be a $5-$10 increase in pay. Glassdoor says it’s about $25/hr, idk how accurate that is. Our HR manager has been in and out so I haven’t been able to ask. 

I’m 24 and I think it would take about a year to finish a BBA, I was working on a finance concentration previously but now that I have experienced the civilian side of things I cannot see myself in any finance position. I would chose marketing if I do go back..

"After job searching for about 2 months without much luck, I have found myself having to pick between two job options.

I'm 25 with a masters in library science, so I'm still early into my career but I honestly don't have that much direction. I was incredibly unhappy at my last job due to the industry and type of work, so I only know that I don't want to be doing that anymore.

Company A is a more creative market research position. I would be working on a small team with someone with a similar background who has really made a name for him/herself in the industry. But I don't know if I'm that interested in the industry. I enjoy writing and analyzing things, but I don't know if I want the position based on a gut feeling and some negative feedback from previous employees (employees being expected to work longer without any raises etc.) overall it seems like a good opportunity but I don't know if it's a good opportunity for me in particular. This position would be more challenging and could potentially lead to better opportunities (that I don't know if I want). 

I also would feel guilty not taking it because the interview process at company A has been going on for so long (1.5 months) and I would feel like I wasted their time and flaked out. 

Company B is a little less interesting: executive search. I would get to use my research skills that I enjoy, but there would not be a real creative outlet like company A. However, this company has a lot more going for it: better benefits, good work/life balance, nice people, opportunities to work with different teams based on career interests, and so on. Company B has also been a fast whirlwind interview experience and I don't know if that's a red flag or shows decisiveness. Like company A, I am not particularly interested in company B's industry.

"Hi Folks,

It was recommended to me to also post here, so here I am. I've been in my current position since July. Short backstory, I've known since about two weeks in that it was a bad fit. The day I was going to  give my two weeks notice, the other purchasing person left on medical leave. I decided to stay, because I didn't want to mess up the whole office by not being there, but now it seems they may not come back. I've decided enough is enough, but what should I do about my resume? A few bullet-point questions below:

* I've  got my resume in a tidy single-page format, and to include this new job  would require me deleting a previous position in which I had three  years of experience. Even though it was retail, is this worth it?
* Between a 4 month employment gap or a 4 month tenure, which looks worse to employers?
* Not  strictly resume related, but something that's been stressing me out  which I don't know where else to ask: what should I actually tell them  when they ask why? I don't want to be honest, because that would burn  bridges.
* Is it even realistic to hope for a reference?
* Is it selfish to stay until I've found a new job or should I use what savings I have to float until my next one? I feel like the longer I stay the worse it will be, but living ain't free either.

I apologize if I've gotten anything wrong or if I was too ranty. Thanks so much for your help.",How do you quit a new(ish) job?,0
"So I work for a big IT company that has an odd policy when it comes to money. Salaries for new hires are very appealing and competitive to bring people in, even if they come fresh out of college. How ever, adjustments and raises once inside are very small for the few people that get them, even if you are a top performer or got a big promotion. One of the VPs literally told me once that ""Our company knows there are higher salaries out there and we won't play the game of retaining people with money. We assume people will leave and we will replace them""

This creates situations where you have inexperienced junior programmers earning more than seniors, among others.

Anyways, I recently hired a senior developer for my team and since I'm his manager, I'm able to see that his salary is considerably higher than mine, around 25% more.

It's important to point out he is a bit older than me and has a few more years of experience. How ever, I have a much bigger workload and of course greater responsibilities.

I've been thinking about raising this concern with my boss, but for the most part I know his hands are tied as this policy comes all the way from the top. Besides, I'm not sure if he could take this the wrong way and get upset about me going through this information, even though it's accessible to all managers.

"At the interview at a fintech company I was asked when I could start working for them. Since, I don't have a job at the moment, my answer was ""immediately"". They moved forward with me, and the HR lady asked me about my earliest start date. Since I want to finish some coursework I'm doing right now, I answered that i could start Monday in two weeks, which is 28th of October. 

I'm not a US citizen (I'm coming from Europe, this will be my first job in the US) and the notification period for leaving a job can be 1 to 3 months, so switching jobs typically does not take place under a month. 

Assuming that the company would have to do some paperwork and some internal setups, I assumed that two weeks would be a reasonable time frame. But now I'm concerned that my answer ""immediately"" and my gap of two weeks could be misinterpreted by the company. The whole interview process with them was quite quickly, so I guess they are a fast-moving company.

I know that the notification period for leaving a job in the US is typically two weeks and I'm wondering if that results in a ""switching time"" of two weeks.

"I apologise if this comes out of a wall of text or as an information dump but I really would like to hear from others on this.

I just graduated this July with a First Class with honours in Mechanical Engineering. its been 6 Months since my finals ended and over a year since my placement ended and I have been applying for a full time position. Since 14th August 2018, I have applied for atleast 500+ positions if not more, I have been entertained and even head hunted at times, I have even secured interviews with some companies, both local (in the UK) and worldwide like Exxon Mobile and Shell for example, Yet everytime the question of sponsorship comes out I am immediately shafted.

I am not from the UK, I hold a passport from the third world and I quite literally do not have a place to call home as I do not have anyone or any place for myself from the country my passport is from and my parents are in a very poor situation themselves in the Middle East. My entire drive and objective in university was to secure success and to emigrate to the first world and I have completely failed at that now.

I am moving back to my parents in two weeks and they have absolutely no one they can contact regarding helping me getting a job secured. On top of that, my dad encourages me to just take any job and work it, but looking at him and how his career played out, I am afraid of making that same mistake he did and getting stuck in a loop with poor pay and no future opportunities because I strayed away from my career due to shortsightedness. I have already worked as an engineer and I am afraid that if I go away from the field for too long or work another field then no one would want to hire me at all, especially internationally, let alone locally. Is this a good idea to just go and work anything?

I have also checked my CV with many professionals in industry, people who work in HR, recruiters and the universities career department so I know my CV isnt the problem because I do get entertained. My dad does insist however on paying for a CV service from Ireland he contacts through whatsapp but I cant see this being worth the money. Would you all recommend this?

I am also really not looking forward to the Middle East as the pay is quite poor and they can be quiet unfair with employee pay and treatment.

My goal at the end of the day is to leave and migrate to Canada or Europe (Vienna, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark are my choices to name a few) and I did want to do a masters to move to these countries but money is a huge issue right now.

On top of all of this, I have had a rough year, I have lost family, I have had alot of financial issues, I have had a rough breakup (not even fought, she just decided to pretend it never happened anymore and has pulled a few moves on me like plan a trip and then stand me up, but its fine because her friends are there to support her and im here by myself) Ive had heartbreak and worst of all, ive lost hope that ill ever get a job and/or be successful or achieve the things I have shed blood sweat and tears for since I was 17. Meanwhile people like my ex and most of my highschool friends are travelling, enjoying lives, getting jobs very easily, getting married and I am just stuck here, failing.

"This probably comes out as venting, but let me know if you have any suggestions:

Hi, I am an engineer have been in the same company for 15 years. About 5 years back I moved from one department to another. The first project was slow, directionless and had a very non-committal/passive project leader. When that project was terminated I found other jobs, including one in the neighboring departments. It was not easy, but I knew the people. I took this job because I knew the people and had good relationship.

My new boss is a good person, but very aggressive. I also had a colleague whom I came to know very well. He was about 5 years senior to me. I thought ""great.. this is the best place"". After about 6 months, I realized that I was being treated as a technician (after being a sr. engineer). I sucked it up and stayed on. On many occasions the relationship with my colleague was very symbiotic and it worked well for the project.

Of late, my colleague started doing a few things that are affecting my work a)Poaching a new contractor b)Pushing another contractor on my project without consulting me (I told him, its not OK and this was very tough for me to say) c)pulling this contractor away for his project without consulting me, d)starting a parallel effort replicating some of my work using the guy he poached. This colleague has about 5 years more experience than me, but is not my manager. I talked to him once when this happened and he said ""he didn't mean it"" and never said sorry. One instance above happened after I talked to him. Since then he has been very reticent.

Edit: I talked to my boss and he was surprised. But he kind of indicated that I misinterpreted things and my colleague was ""result oriented"". But, I insisted that the misinterpretation can happen a few times, but now it is a pattern. He was concerned and bothered. 

I am feeling very discouraged/disheartened and the place feels toxic because of such things. I talked to my boss and he was surprised to learn, as I never let him know earlier infractions.

I still have an interview scheduled with Company B on Friday. 

I looked up some reviews online and the ones for Company A are pretty mixed. It's apparently a fairly good place for entry level workers in my field, and the company has a fun, young atmosphere, but many of the reviews added that the work is repetitive and that upper management is a ""boys' club"" and generally not very efficient. This matches my experience - the interviews were a little odd (both times they seemed extremely bored with the conversation despite quickly accepting my application soon after; the man at my second interview also made a handful of joking-but-slightly-snarky comments about my portfolio), and their starting salary is pretty low (about $3k less than what I asked for, and $6k less than I was making at my previous job).

Company B only has a few reviews on Glassdoor but they're all five stars (maybe that's suspicious too, I don't know. Company A's reviews are highly mixed and the 'good ones' sound a little defensive).

"I'm 27 and I just started a new job (supply chain/project management field) that I don't think is the right fit for me anymore. At my previous company, the job was super easy (also logistics but more order management), chill coworkers and office, 4 weeks PTO, never had to do any meetings or conference calls. The only thing I didn't really like was that it was hourly. And the pay was about $19/hr. There also wasn't much room to grow or move around. One of the upper manager can be strict sometimes but I never really interacted with her.

I was not looking but a recruiter reached out to me about the new job I have now. It is salary and about 30% increase in pay. The work was what I used to do at another company, and I knew it would be more work than at my previous job. I took the opportunity as a new challenge but now I miss my old job and feeling some regret. First, the company is very small and sometimes I am the only one in the office. I didn't think about this before accepting but this means that I have some office manager duties such as checking mail, be in charge of the keys and locking the office, ordering supplies, some cleaning...so basically I have to do my main job plus the extra duties as I didn't think about how small the office would be. This wasn't in the main job description but w/e. My previous company was bigger so I didn't worry about having to do all that.

Some other cons of this new job: frequent conference calls which I hate. I am overwhelmed with all the information and nothing seems organized, I don't feel like I'll ever fully get it? I feel underqualified. The person that's also doing this started 5 years ago and created all the processes. But the processes aren't organized. Only 2 weeks PTO which is meh. I don't think work-life balance is as great as my old job. Since my old job was hourly, we were just require to show up for 8 hours and leave. Commute is not better or worse. Another thing is that I am lonely. Sometimes it's just me in an empty office all day. Again these are just some things I didn't think about til I quit :( ...

"Recently I applied for a from-home data entry position. A while later i received an email from the potential employer saying I was of interest and was sent a 'Simple Job Application Form'. I filled it out (thus far the only information they have on me is my name, address, email, and phone number). 

Soon after I was emailed saying I was accepted to the position, that it paid $25/hr, with an expectation of 20hr per week of work. I received a text message from the hiring manager, who asked if I wanted to take the job. I said yes and she said she would send a package with on-boarding material and a $1,000 check to purchase a laptop with. 

Today I received the package. Included was a single printout with job expectations (essentially saying I would be emailed weekly with what to do. There have been no references to training or anything like that), a blank W-4 with instructions to fill it out, scan it, and email it to the hiring manager, and a check for a whopping $3,800.

Thus far I have no actually spoken to anyone, only communicating through email or text. I haven't signed anything. the website for the company is rather minimal as well. The address on the check is a Spa in Florida (The company is based in Michigan) and based on Linkedin information, the person who signed the check is the President of the Spa. The signature is electronically printed, not written with pen and hand signed. When I asked about the check, the hiring manager told me that the spa is a client of theirs. 

So... sketchy, right? Why would a company have a client write a check to their employee? Why would a company hire an employee to a lucrative position without any interview?

Unless any of you can convince me otherwise, I don't trust them enough to fill out the W-4 and send it to them, as that would give them my SSN. My biggest question is: Should I cash the check? It's a significant sum of money that I could really use.",Should I cash a check from a sketchy potential employer?,0

"I got fired from a small company for performance issues. I was not producing the level of quality they expected of me.

I had a direct manager who I had a very good rapport with, and who agreed to be a positive reference in a job search while I was still working at the company.

"Hey all,

I'm going to try to keep my story short:

I graduated with a degree in Environmental Science in August 2019. I landed my first job in December of 2019 and quickly realized that my (then) boss lied about the job and what it entailed. It was a government call center, and my boss also turned out to be emotionally abusive to all of the staff. I started looking for jobs after my 3rd month.

I stayed until June of 2019, (6 months) when I was hired as a teacher in a charter school, teaching my degree subject area to middle schoolers. However, I have again found myself in a toxic work environment. Multiple teachers have already left, and there is no support when it comes to discipline issues. On top of that, teaching is exhausting, and I'm dealing with most first-year teacher issues with no formal training.

I am currently seeing a therapist, but my mental health is taking a hit. I want to try and stick it out for the full school year (until June 2020), but at this point, I'm not sure if I'll make it. In theory, if I quit my current teaching position, I know that I'd be seen as a job hopper, and I'd have an extremely hard time finding a new, good position.

Would there be hope for me to find something stable after two jobs in a year, or would it forever damage my future career/resume? Has anyone done this and found success?

Fast forward to the in person interview, it goes well and the store manager (I believe?) tells me he wants me on his team and will send me an offer. The next day, he calls me to come in and fill out new hire paperwork, gives me an employee handbook and switches me to a different department (Clicklist).

Then he told me he would call me within the next week (aka, all of last week) to get started with orientation. Like 3 days ago, I got an email saying that I would need to get a background check and would receive another email in regards to that, but I've gotten nothing. They never did call either.

I've been waiting because I currently work another job that I want to get out of, but the switching of departments and no communication is throwing me off to where I feel like I actually didn't get the job. And I know I should probably call Kroger, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me or if this is a red flag?

"I applied for a position a couple of weeks ago and received an interview invitation less than a week later. It's a large F500 company, and I was surprised that they skipped any phone interviews/screenings and moved right into an in-person. I'm not sure why I started freaking out over my references. I've never been asked to provide any, nor have I ever been called when someone has asked me to be a reference. I just had three listed just in case it ever came up.

I decided to do that trick where I had a friend pretend to be a hiring manager and call my references. One sounded completely unprofessional and treated the phone call as if it was an inconvenience. The other seriously down played my experience working with them, even though that person and I both know we worked so hard together and helped each other accomplish so much with our respective positions.

I work for a fairly small company and my coworker is leaving in a few days. We have very similar jobs with a few minor differences. I’ve basically mastered my job and I know his isn’t much more difficult. I always see him slacking off so I know it cant be too stressful of a job. I know I could handle the workload without having to do too much overtime. I would like to confront my boss and ask him if I could consume his role as part of mine for a raise of maybe 25-30%.  I’d even like to see if he’d be willing to change my title to senior level or something along those lines since I will be handing more responsibility. This way I get a raise and I’m happy and they save on having to hire/train/pay a new employee. I don’t want to seem like I have so much extra time though and have them just throw it on me without giving a raise.

"I’m a recently graduated chemical engineer and I’ve been working in this company for a year now. It’s a small enterprise (around 20 employees) and it had been really chill to work at. Since it’s so small I do a lot of things (production assistant, quality management for inks and I+D for colorant dispersions).

My boss was a really nice and easy going person at first. I’ve always been responsible and have done some improvements in formulas and proceedings so he offered me a raise in exchange of me working as production manager for the colorant dispersions, which I accepted.

About 4 months ago I heard the company is not in a good place because it’s been losing a lot of costumers and it’s not selling like it had in the past, but I didn’t see any changes. When I started working as the production manager, suddenly some machinery presented some unexpected problems so I arranged their maintenance. The company that was working for us is still fixing their jobs on the machinery because the machinery is too old and my boss keeps pushing me to ask for it to be fixed rather than investing in new equipment.

Also, he keeps asking me to make colorant dispersion formulas that are the same (or better) than a big company that develops colorant dispersions... I am the only person working in this project (I+D of the colorants) and working quality control as well for the inks department and I believe it is impossible for me to achieve those results by myself with the equipment we have... I wish he’d be more realistic because I have given him better formulas, just not international company level good formulas.

My boss has been putting me on the spot by blasting mails, on which he says I’m not doing a good job or enough and copies a lot of the other employees... I feel sad, stressed and under appreciated. I do my best but it pains me listening to my boss tell me every day it is not enough and that he regrets giving me the raise because I don’t deserve it (i really need it because I need to support myself). He blames me saying we don’t sell enough because my formulas are not good enough (my formulas are better than the ones they had before and those sold a lot, so I understand my job is doing well)...

I’ve been applying to other companies day and night desperately because I cannot handle the stress. I need some advice on what to do or what to say to my boss because I can’t handle this and I cannot quit or I’ll end up jobless.

I want to know how I could defend myself letting him know I am working but that his expectations are to high for what the company has to offer (machinery, personell and product wise) and that even though it´s not the same as the company he wants to compete with that I have given him better results.

TL;DR: My boss understands I’m not working because my research results are not the same as the international level company we rival when I’m the only one working on this project.","My boss requests me to achieve unrealistic results, how can I confront him?",0
"I work as a home health aide. I work with people with developmental and physical disabilities who need assistance with daily tasks.. however, I don't think what my client is requesting is related to the work I'm supposed to be doing for him.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I drive my client around to different stores and farm stands in the area for produce. I don't mind doing this, but I figure while we're out and about it wouldn't be a big deal if I picked up something for lunch (Fast food or a salad somewhere) to take back to his house and eat. My client gets upset about this and acts as if it's a big deal, while we're already out and I am paying out of pocket for the gas that I'm using to drive him around. I don't get reimbursed. I have made that clear to him. Also, when we are driving he doesn't allow me to use my GPS (because he ""knows"" the way) and when I have opened **my own** window while driving **my ow**n car he tells me ""***You shouldn't really have the windows down""***, I'm sorry, but this is **my car** and when **I'm not being reimbursed** for my mileage and paying out of pocket to drive you around I will do what I want in my car. If we were in his home it would be a different story.. but it's my car and it isn't posing a threat to him to have a window cracked.
2. Speaking of windows.. I am required to do some light house cleaning. I don't mind doing this, in fact, I enjoy it as I get away from him for a little while. However, he has recently requested that I install ***window insulation*** on all of his windows. I don't know if that is considered light house cleaning. And I'm not sure if I feel comfortable doing it. He has 5x4 foot windows and wants me to move heavy furniture to be able to access them. This is what he wants me to do: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=79&amp;v=KLYBqe54Mco)
3. He confronted me about using my phone. I could understand this if I were looking at my phone all day while I'm with him. It would be warranted.. but the other day he spent **2 hours** monologuing about all kinds of things. For 2 hours straight I listened attentively. ***From 9 AM when I started until after 11 AM***, around this time I quickly looked at my phone to check the time and he confronted me. He told me that I look at my phone ""all the time"", in his words: *""you look at that a lot, you were on it a lot while we were talking""* ***""now we don't have time to go to the gym""***. This is not because I was on my phone but because he spent two hours talking.
4. Additionally - I work with him for 8 hours a day from 9 until 5. I am very diligent in my work and I don't dilly dally around, I like to get things done. I do dishes when I see them, I clean the bathroom, the bedroom, I have a system.. so I usually have downtime at the end of the day (About 30-45 minutes). I've been on my feet for nearly 8 hours with no ""real break""s. He is usually on his computer playing chess or watching movies so I figure he wouldn't mind if I caught up on some business stuff on my computer. I have a few side businesses and I am also studying. I don't use the internet or check social media while at work, I wouldn't do that. I am very career-minded and most of my downtime even at home is focused on growing my businesses and studying (I'm finishing a degree next semester). He has a problem with this. He says, in his words: ""***My kitchen table isn't a home office""***  
He has pried and asked me what I'm doing, has asked what it's for, what I'm working on, what kind of businesses I run.. things that I don't feel comfortable talking to him about. I don't like people to pry into my personal life. And when I said that it's my ""personal business"" He laughed and asked, kind of rudely, ***""Well is it business or personal??""*** He almost mockingly asks me if I ***actually*** make any money doing what I'm doing. He is very passive-aggressive, and recently confronted me about bringing my computer. He said it's weird that I took it with when we went to his doctors appointments (did he just expect me to wait in the waiting room for him twiddling my thumbs with nothing to do??), his exact words were *""Do you want to get away from the machine a little bit, put that away for a little while, give that a rest?”* After I had only been working on it for about 5 or 10 minutes, and I had already completed all the tasks he had requested of me. ***He has gone so far as to ask me to not even have it in my bag!!*** Even if I don't use it in his home, he's asked me to not carry my own belongings.  
**\*\*\*\*\*\***And it's especially clear that my side work is not getting in the way of this job because ***yesterday I did not bring my laptop*** and did not get out my phone and I still got done early. I addressed him and told him I was finished with what he had asked me to do and if I asked if there was anything else I could do for him. He said no, and that he was pretty tired and was going to take a nap. He went upstairs and I tidied up a bit but I still had **2 hours** left to do ***NOTHING*** but sit there by myself. Everything was finished. What would have been the issue if I had brought my laptop to be proactive in those 2 hours??!
5. I'm not sure about this one, I could just be a little paranoid.. but I think he might read my text messages/look at my computer screen at what I'm writing. The reason why I think this might be the case is because I will be reading/writing something and go away from my computer or phone for a bit (usually to go to the bathroom) and leave it open. Later on he will mention something related to what I had been writing or reading about. **For example:** I had been writing a script for a video about my weight loss and some of the supplements I had taken during my weight loss. I mentioned magnesium and ***not 20 minutes later*** he was asking me if magnesium was good for weight loss. It freaks me out and honestly makes me feel a little unsafe/uneasy. What else might he be trying to look at on my phone/computer?!

Am I being petty? Is my client just difficult or is something amiss here?? Should I grin and bear it or talk to me supervisor?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I know I don't like him as a person.. we are not compatible personality-wise. I am very quiet and determined, he is a big talker and a bit of a dilly-dallier. He talks about himself nonstop, and has literally even told me that ***he doesn't like hearing about the aides lives. He doesn't care about their lives.*** He has an air of entitlement.. he has never once thanked me for anything I have done while there. My other clients are all very humble and thankful for the service. He acts as if he's entitled to treat me like a slave. He never even thanked me for spending my money on him. I told him I'm not reimbursed and so I am doing it of my own accord. Can't even thank me for that. Very entitled. But I like the hours that I'm getting with him, I just wish they weren't with **HIM**. I would rather work longer hours with other clients but they don't need the hours. He's actually using the service so he doesn't have to go into a nursing home. There is an aide with him from the organization that I work for **almost** 24/7. I really think he needs to be in a nursing home and it's his pride that's keeping him from doing so.",What can I do about a rude/entitled client that is most likely abusing my services?,0
"My dad keeps telling me it’s pointless to just apply to jobs online and that I should be ‘knocking on doors’ and introducing myself and handing out my resume. Most jobs I apply to are posted online (w online application forms) and/or explicitly say to send a resume to an email address. Sometimes they’ll even firmly insist NOT to call/visit without being invited.

But for the ones that don’t explicitly say so, is it worth physically going in to give my resume/introduce myself? Or would I be shooting myself in the foot?

My dads a very successful doctor and says that in his practice they’re old-fashioned and delete almost all email/online applications, and he seems to think that’s absolutely what everyone else does. Maybe there’s some truth to that but on the whole, I think he’s behind the times.

**Edit:** I have a bachelors in English/creative writing from Rhode Island college, and I’m studying online for a certificate in grant writing from virgins tech, and I’m a continuing education/certificate program animation student at RISD (Animation is the dream job I’m really working hard to get, unlike what my dad thinks of it).

I am a very creative person and work well independently though I can also work in a team. I have skills/experience in writing, data entry, community outreach, event planning, program coordinating, editing, graphic design, Spanish (tho not fully bilingual I can get by in a conversation and my reading/writing skills in Spanish are stronger), sales, education, working with teens, networking, secretary work, taking information over the phone, home visits, at-risk youth, low-income communities, cultural sensitivity, Microsoft Office, and Google Drive.

I’ve worked as a grant-writing intern at a local nonprofit helping local low-income Latino residents, then a secretary assistant/cleaning person at my church and a seasonal team member at target (mostly clothes, sometimes cashier).

After that I worked a year and 3 months with Americorps VISTA and created an adolescent peer health ambassador program, teaming up with local nonprofits and health professionals of all sorts to teach our members about healthy living in a less academic environment and more importantly to give them the skills to live a healthy life (nutrition, sexual health, etc). I also helped write and edit a 50+ page community health plan for the city that outlines information and statistics of the current well-being and health trends of city residents (lead poisoning, housing, pregnancy rates, exercise, mood disorders, etc) and offers solutions and plans to improve these areas. I edited not only the written content but the cover and visuals of it as well, and my name is credited in this book, which as I understand has since been given to the local fire department and nearby cities so they can perhaps create their own.

Then I was a community outreach worker and reached out to everyone in the city that had a drug overdose in the past year (by phone call and/or home visit) and worked with them to get any services they need, whether it’s for recovery or a dentist or whatever they need. During this time I wrote a short paper about drug use trends in this city which was accepted to present at this years American Public Health Association Annual Meeting &amp; Expo. This job was for two months because of the grant, though I will be going to that expo in November.

Most recently I was an Outreach Associate at Oak Street Health, a primary care clinic for adults on Medicare. I was essentially a salesman, going to senior centers and local events, spreading the word and trying to recruit new patients. We’d often use raffle prizes to get ppl interested. Then I would call and/or visit any leads I had. We were supposed to call them every two weeks and maintain some relationship until the clinic opens in November (I started in June). All my other jobs I left (because they were temporary positions) on good terms but this is the first job I’ve been fired from, though my supervisor did offer to serve as a reference for me. She was rly nice and helpful and did her best to help and guide me but we both agreed I just couldn’t keep up. I have autism (among other things) and I realized quickly that to work in sales you need every skill that autism impacts. The job was so stressful it was giving me nightmares but it had decent benefits so I stayed. Eventually I was fired because I couldn’t meet my quotas and a lot of little mistakes (forgetting to bring the paint for an activity, generally being awkward, forgetting my ID, tardiness to outside events) added up, although my boss did recognize my effort and that I was so desperate to succeed. And I wasn’t completely useless, I did a lot of graphic design for the team, I was very friendly with and empathetic to potential clients (which was especially helpful with low-income communities and communities of color) and able to find something to relate to them with (whether it’s as simple as having the same horoscope or as heavy as having a disability). Many of my leads told me how kind and fun I was and I used those skills as best I could, something my boss recognized and was proud of me for.

"Hi all and apologies in advance if formatting is shitty (I'm on mobile). 
So three weeks ago I started a job as a support worker and go to visit clients in their houses. The clients that my employer provides support for live all over the metro area and the city that I live in is quite spread out. I have been assigned a 3 hour shift in an suburb that would take me nearly the same amount of time to drive there and back from. I also won't get reimbursed for kilometres I do while travelling there and back (only the kilometres I do as part of the 3 hours). It's also probably worth noting that if the client cancels support with insufficient notice, I don't get paid for the full 3 hours I was assigned... even if I've already made the 1 hour and a bit journey to the client's house. 
I don't want to do this shift for the reasons that it's way too far for me to go for only a 3 hour shift.

I'm still on probation, so I am reluctant to do it. If I don't feel better by tomorrow I don't know if I can go in. The probation period is 90 days. I believe my probation will be over in November because I started working there August 8th.

Since we work around food, I would not want to contaminate the food. I don't want my virus to spread to other colleagues.

Since I am part-time, I will come in on one of my off days to make up for it.

My manager has been impressed with my performance. My attendance has been perfect so far.

"Hi. I have a degree in history which has turned out to be pretty useless in both California (born and raised) and Oregon (moved after graduating). I thought I would be able to find an entry-level office job because that's what I did throughout college, in various internships and even working at my school's career center for a year. In California and Oregon both, I've been told by hiring managers that thousands of applicants apply for one entry-level role. I am curious how to find out where I could go in this country where the job market is WAY better. Bonus points if this place also has reasonable housing. I'm open to anywhere because I don't have much money saved and I have to leave my current housing situation within the month, with nowhere to go.

"I’m thinking about quitting my second (part time)  job now that my first job bumped me up to full time hours. The problem is, I’m still sort of being trained at my second job. I feel like I should stay long enough to make a real contribution and make  it worth my coworkers’ while to have spent all this time training me. Also, I really like my coworkers at the second job. At what point is it OK to quit? And how can I maintain relationships with my coworkers after I quit when I haven’t been there long enough to really form long-term bonds with anyone?

More info: Both of my jobs started out part-time. The first one is related to my degree and closer to my ideal career path. The second job is a lower-wage customer service job, but requires a lot more training and practice than I initially realized to do effectively. I picked up the second job for more financial security, but now that I’m full time at the first job, I no longer need that income.

I’m working 55-60 hours a week right now, commuting 2 hours total every day. Monday-Friday, I typically spend about 1 hour getting ready/making breakfast, 2 hours commuting, 12 hours working, and then I have an hour left to get ready for bed and do anything else that needs to happen before I go to sleep and start all over again. (I can’t function well on less than 7.5-8 hours of sleep — I’ve tried.) I feel like I have no free time during the week and spend most of Saturday doing chores I can’t do most days, like cooking for the week, grocery shopping, and cleaning. I have very little social life and very little time for hobbies or exercise.

My coworker told me it often takes people six months to really get the hang of my second job. I’ve been there just a few months. My coworkers still have watch me pretty closely and show/remind me how to do things a lot.

"I was unemployed for 16 months after leaving my first job out of college.

It felt like every month of that time period, I'd discover a new rock bottom.  My parents were kinda supporting me when they remembered and I was too embarassed to ask out right, so I'm gonna be honest there were days where I didn't eat.

I'd run out of things like toothpaste, soap, sugar. During the tail end of that 16 months I was completely *desperate*.

I was applying for anything. Literally anything, even jobs I was severely overqualified for (or so I thought). In my mind, that means I have a higher chance of being accepted. Looking back now, now that I did get a low paying dead end job before getting an appropriate one, I know the hidden pitfalls of looking or settling for a job-I'm-only-doing-so-I-can-pay-rent.


*1. Looking for a job IS a full-time job*

It might not be obvious, but job hunting is a full time job. It requires you to invest hours on checking ads, filling dozens of applications a day, checking your emails almost hourly, being available to be called (recruiters rarely call back), going to multiple levels of interview that each takes half a day...

And most importantly, they all happen within the regular office hours. If you take on a job that makes you unavailable during those times, you'll significantly decrease your chances of finding a better job.

*2. Looking for a low-paying job is not easier*

I was rejected about 23 times from job that doesn't even require a degree. Why? Those jobs aren't interested that I have a degree, they want someone that could do the job. Yes, the dreaded word, *experience*..

Yes so I have a degree in accounting but do I have a clue about how to be a seamstress assistant? Or a bakery personnel? 

For these places, your overqualificiation means nothing. They want someone that's done this before.

And hunting for these jobs require the same amount of time and effort, honestly.

*3. Once you do a job once, that's all they'll ever offer you*

People that have worked in call centers, serving crews, secretaries, and the like knows what I am talking about. 

I worked for a call center and no matter what position I was applying for, I always get reverted back to ""Well, you applied to be a data analyst/bookeper/accountant but I see you have experience in phone calls, we actually have an opening for---""

No.

 Mr. Recruiter, you see, I am applying here so I can *quit* that type of job.

Accepting a job that youre overqualified for achors you to that level. I am gonna say that not having any experience at all is better than having experience in a low-paying poaition that has nothing to do with your degree, if youre young.

"I worked for a corporate pediatric dental office for 6 years. I was the manager for the last 3. I know it’s cliche but the staff was my family. When working hand in hand 10 hours a day you become close. Anyway. I disagreed with a doctor and how he was treating staff there. I tried to speak with him about it, he refused. I brought it to my regional manager for help. During that time the doc was writing to our president saying really vicious things about me and I ended up being fired in May. It was and is still an extreme shock. 

Flash forward to July. I get hired at an insurance company. My sister in law put in a good word for me as she is a manager in a different department within the company. I have anxiety every single day thinking of going to work. My jobs went from one end of the spectrum to the other. At the dental practice it was fun, a team effort, a lot of communication. At this new job I am alone in a cubicle, it is repetitive, no one talks, I put head phones in for 8 hours a day. 

Two girls I worked with at the dental office are now with another doc I used to work with and the doc has been asking about me. I feel like I’d be a lot more comfortable and happy there but I won’t have the opportunity to move with in the company or be as financially stable due to it being a newer office. But I do believe it will be a successful practice and the doctor will be a great boss.

"I'm applying for a job and they want a writing sample. The job is a writer for one of those story based mobile apps, so I assume they want a sample of my creative writing (they asked for a relevant sample, so I assume that's what they mean). I have never done a writing sample before, but I looked online and learned that I basically just submit two pages of a relevant piece with a paragraph for context. However, I have a few questions...

My samples are using custom margins set for novels (top/bottom 1"", left/right 0.65), but I printed it out just to see how it reads on paper, and of course it threw the dimensions off. Should I make my margins normal (top/bottom/left/right all 1"") and just size the font up so it looks better so if they print it, everything still looks nice?

"Hello,

I graduated from nursing school in Ontario and got my license in March 2019. Within a couple weeks of receiving my license I accepted a job at a sleepaway summer camp as a camp nurse.

"Hello all, I am bored to tears with my current career and am looking to change to something more rewarding/challenging. I am also interested in finding something more lucrative. 

I have a bachelors degree in Criminal Justice with a minor in Psychology. My work history consists of me working office jobs for about 2 years until I get bored or cannot afford to live on the salary before moving up slightly. 

Career experience: 

Legal Assistant for two years at a small firm. I did not enjoy the amount of time spent fielding calls and being yelled at by clients or the inability to ever move up without becoming an attorney. I also did not enjoy that every day was exactly the same, I need variety. 

Performance Analyst for a state agency for two years. I was low level so I was not making enough to survive. I enjoyed the heavy Excel work and generating weekly/monthly/quarterly reports and lack of interaction with the general public.

Current position: Administrative Assistant at same state agency for a different division, about 2.5 years. I enjoy the Excel aspects of my job but for the most part, I feel like my time and talents are wasted on scanning/filing/emailing etc. I would rather work towards solving problems. There is a variety in my work, but none of it is challenging. 

Does anyone have any advice on what my next steps should be? Or what careers would align with my interests of problem solving, variety in tasks, Excel skills (without many other skills)? I am currently making 40k in a medium cost of living city.","Looking for a change in career, need help with determining a realistic direction.",0

"I’ve been with my company for 2 1/2 years and am up for a promotion sometime by the end of this year. However, my current company has recently gone through a merger and they’re still working out the terms of what that entails. From what it looks like for now, they might keep our department instead of the one we’re merging with, but that sounds like HR’s way of making sure we don’t jump ship too soon. 

In the meantime, I have a tentative offer with another company - it’s a similar role in a bigger firm where I could get more exposure in my career, but would be a much more lateral move. The benefits are better, but the pay would be about what I make now (instead of a promotion-based pay bump) and it would mean adapting to a new work culture. 

In this case, would it be better to hold out for the promotion, maybe try it out until our department is integrated due to the merger and then jump ship? In this case, I may get a promotion but my job might not be around in about a year or so (not to mention, more responsibilities due to more job duties and the merger). Or would it be wise to make the lateral jump to another company while I still have the offer?

"I am a young female who currently works as a ""Customer Service Specialist"" for a small telecom company but will be moving to the NYC area in a little over a year once my boyfriend finishes school. I put Customer Service Specialist in quotes but my job is just a small portion of Customer Service whereas we focus a lot on Project Management, Sales, provisioning, porting, and billing. I am looking to get out of the Customer Service type of position once we move and have really enjoyed the Project Management aspects of my role. I have a Bachelor's Degree and think the title of my position will weakens my resume and chances about getting out of the Customer Service type jobs. I have a great relationship with the company and they do not know I plan on leaving and don't want to get any ideas in their head to ruin my current reputation, but I do plan on giving them about a months notice in advance.
 
My family has been encouraging me to ask for a raise since my job duties have expanded since I took the position and we've gotten more added to our responsibilities. Should I ask for a job title change and ask for a raise together? How do you ask for a raise and what is a good % to aim for?

The title change is more so I could change it on my resume, is that too superficial? Is there anything I should put my resume to strengthen the work that I do to express it's not just some minimum wage Customer Service job? Does anyone have suggestions on Project Management courses or certifications I could do while I have time before leaving? How do I leave Customer Service?

"My colleagues show up early/stay late/come in on weekends to catch up on work. I tried coming in late one time when I started the job, sent an email that got time stamped really late at night, and got called into a meeting where I was asked if I was overwhelmed. I was not overwhelmed. I just like putting in extra hours sometimes—especially when the space isn’t busy with people. I feel like my boss has arbitrary rules for me/things and that anything I do could get criticized. Moreover, they have a visceral aversion and unreasonably angry reaction to anyone—including superiors—asking questions, despite the fact that they themselves ask tons of questions. (Personality disorder, perhaps?)

Right now, we’re at a critical point where we have a lot of projects coming due. I’d like to go in this weekend to just work on stuff and make sure I’m ahead of the game and any deadlines. But I’m worried my manager will find out and start accusing me of being overwhelmed. They mentioned payroll and that they can’t pay us for the extra hours, which seemed reasonable, and maybe they only mentioned the workload part to seem less self-interested. (It might seem more kind to ask if you’re overburdening someone than to tell them to not work as much, so as to not have to pay them more money.) In this case, though, I’m not interested in submitting a timecard with more hours. All this said, in the broader scheme, I feel like from the start they have they used any opportunity possible to make anything I do problematic and an indictment on me and my work.

"A company asked me in for an interview for a position I had interviewed for already several months ago. I was initially rejected but the boss liked me and asked me in for a position with a different manager.

The interview went well and HR called me afterwards saying there was positive feedback but they were in a hiring freeze likely till the end of next month.

I got an update call a week after the interview saying I’m still the top candidate, the role is something they want to get started with asap - but due to the hiring freeze, cannot offer yet.

The end of the month comes and HR calls saying the hiring freeze is lifted, you are still top candidate, no one else has been interviewed, but due to company processes she cannot offer yet. “Hopefully, I’ll get in touch with you next week with an offer.”

That was two weeks ago with no contact. I sent an email a few days ago with no response. I’m planning to call on Monday.

As of today, it has been a little over 2 months since my interview and I’m quite frustrated. I’m wondering if I’m just being lead on with this “top candidate” stuff. The woman from HR is very hard to get hold of which doesn’t help.

"Last week I started a new retail job. The store just opened up and it’s much different than I expected. When I was interviewed last month I was upfront with the manager that this was my third job and that I was only looking for about 2 days a week. The manager seems to forget this every day and I reminded him at least 4 times about this since we started and each time he seems very surprised. He keeps asking ‘’So you really can’t work any other days than this’’ as if I mislead him somehow.

I work 7 days a week and I was just looking for a few hours extra on the side and he has me on 24 hours a week. I tried to ask if I could work less and he firmly said, ‘’No, you’re going to work 8 hours a day’’ (Even though most people at my job work 5-6) . 

On top of that the schedule is decided about a day or two before we come in each day. We still don’t even have a weekly schedule. On top of that sometimes they will change our schedules less than 12 hours before we come in without telling us because we have to use an app.

I am exhausted and in pain from being on my feet all day every day. Maybe it’s my fault for taking on too much but I really needed the extra money.

I think the hardest part is this is across the street from where I currently work so I don’t want to make anything awkward if I quit. I just feel incredibly stupid for putting myself in this situation.

I don’t even know how to quit. I feel like if I just say ‘’This job isn’t what I expected’’ or ‘’This job isn’t for me’’ they will try to talk me out of quitting or get angry.

I also feel bad because they’re just starting up and I don’t want to leave them short handed because I feel like even if I give 2 weeks notice that won’t be enough time for them to find someone and replace me.

"Yesterday, I interviewed for a position at this non-profit and was given a verbal offer later the same day. I said I was flattered, but asked for some time to think about it and now have 2 days before talking to HR again and asking for a written offer.

From the interview, I learned that the position would give me tons of experience related to my public health major and many opportunities to develop a plethora of skills (e.g. community outreach, public speaking, case management, graphic design, etc). Also, the non-profit is well known so I would be getting the advantage of saying I worked there and building connections from my job. It helps that the commute is only a 15 minute drive from my place. 

However, I’m worried I may not have the grit to constantly juggle so many responsibilities. This could be imposter syndrome early at work though. The job requires me to work 1 night/week and 3-4 Saturdays/month. However, the employee leaving mentioned they’ve worked several evenings a week. Is this the norm for the non-profit sector? Based on the manager’s comments, not only would I be responsible for carrying out duties that were listed on the job posting, but also working on things that weren’t listed to help the team. Work/life balance is one of my biggest values, but I’d be sacrificing it working here. It’s an exempt salary position for $30k-$32k. I’m not sure of benefits because I forgot to ask, but will inquire with HR.

I got the impression that this may be a disorganized, but hardworking place to work at. HR seems to be constantly swamped with work and everyone I saw looked neutral or tired. I’m not sure if the people here are overworked or if that’s just the nature of the job, working for this organization, and/or expected from the non-profit sector. I’ve always wanted to work at a non-profit after volunteering at several and agreeing with their philosophy. 

The person I’d be replacing said I’d have to practice good time management skills, advocate for myself, enforce boundaries, and explained that the job essentially involves me chasing other people down. The manager is new (has only worked there for 3 months) and said that other people have left, so I may have to take on additional responsibilities. Both the former employee and the manager said they have yet to determine how I would be trained. Despite all of that, they reassured me that clear communication is possible if I speak up for myself and ask for help. They’re aware it’s a steep learning curve to get used to.

"Hi all.

I'm currently working in a retail job position, and have been with my company for 2 and a half months. At my interview, my boss was interviewing me and said that I would very likely be promoted to a keyholder within a few weeks of working to compensate for a manager leaving soon after.

Time went on, and any time I brought up the position or my interest in it, she would say that she was still working on it or trying to make sure they had the resources for my training. Seems legitimate, right?

About two or three weeks ago, I brought my friend in to apply for a job there because we're short staffed. We had four employees before hiring her, and now we're up to five: my boss, my manager, me, and two other coworkers in the same position (one of which is my friend). Within four shifts at my job, my friend had already been offered and begun training on the keyholder position.

I asked my boss why I wasn't getting the promotion, and what was holding me back. She said that I had problems with being late--which is understandable, given that I've run late to a few of my shifts because of circumstances out of my control--and that my uniform shirt was wrinkly. What?

Now I thought that things would be okay once my manager told me that my boss had told her that I'd be getting the keyholder promotion around the holiday season. ...Then that promotion was being pushed until February of next year. I was starting to get pretty mad.

Today, my friend informed me that she was talking with my boss about the keyholder position. My friend told her that she wasn't sure about taking the position due to ""added stress and feeling there are people more qualified for the job than her."" My boss immediately commented that there was something going on between my friend and I. My friend denied this. My boss then told her, directly, ""If you don't take this keyholder position, I'll hire someone else."" 

What can I do about this? Is my boss in the wrong? What should I do? 

Any help or comments are appreciated. Thanks. If something's unclear, please let me know and I can edit or reply! Also, if the flair is wrong, I'm sorry! I wasn't exactly sure if I should do 'promotions' or 'office relations'.","My boss promised a promotion, and now is refusing to treat me right",0

"So, a little background.

I have been working at my current company (a tech startup) for a little over a year, and it's the first real job I've ever had. The mentorship from my manager has been incredible, my team is like my family, and I was able to move into a senior position within the first 6 months. I can say I'm genuinely happy to go in every single day and see everyone. The work itself is a weird mix between customer success and operations, but it's also not too shabby. 

However, a month or so ago, I started to feel like I had stagnated and capped out on what else I could do there. I still loved seeing my friends, but I felt a bit restless. I wasn't actively looking for a job, but I had a recruiter reach out to me from a much larger company on LinkedIn. I decided to give the interview process a try, and after a very long, 2.5 hour interview, I found out yesterday that I got the job and that they were very impressed with my skills in general.

My snap reaction was excitement, but it quickly moved to a feeling of deep anxiety; can I really take on all of the responsibilities of this job? I feel like I'm doubting myself because the pay increase is really significant (too significant to pass up), and I'm only 23 years old. On top of this feeling of doubt, I know how bummed out my co-workers (and myself) are going to be when I leave. It's going to sound cheesy, but working at my current company has been such a healing and transformative experience for me.

"I was flown out to a 5 person panel interview.  This is after completing a phone screen with the company recruiter, a Skype interview with 2 VPs (one would be my boss) and a personality profile.  It’s for a senior role in a Fortune 500.  5 person panel was conducted in 2 stages:  first stage was with company President and the CFO.  Second stage was with VP HR, and 2 other people on the senior leadership team.  Interview was about 3 hours.

At the end of it, the VP HR openly stated he had concerns with how I left my last job.  I was let go as part of a restructuring and received a significant settlement after hiring a lawyer.  However, as part of that settlement, I can’t disclose any details about the settlement or circumstances that led up to it.  I explained this.  It was wrongful termination which the company classified as a restructuring, even though my role was not eliminated, I was just replaced.  It was a personality conflict with new leadership, VP HR believes I was ‘caught on something’ and terminated as a result.  I couldn’t provide any more details to defend myself and this is a pretty damning point of view for the HR guy to have.

Aside from that, I hit it out of the park with everyone else.

How much influence is this VP of HR going to have?  Aside from that line of questioning, I had solid answers to all of his questions. My understanding is that the hiring manager makes the call and takes ‘input’ from HR.

"I'm quitting my job of 5 months in a startup. Honestly I just took this job because it was the first, best offer after I got laid off from my previous company. My team and coworkers have been pretty friendly. My manager, who was newly hired a month ago seems like a decent dude, he's been very nice to me (he gave me a gift card for my birthday shortly after he joined, I believe out of his own pocket).

The main issue is I don't like the founders/upper management who are control freaks, don't trust anyone to do their jobs - traits I've had negative experiences with in a previous job. I also don't believe in the company's product and ability to grow as they've been treading water for the past 5 years and have only now received series A funding (they've had a VERY rocky history with employees, with a hire and fire culture).

Long story short I accepted a new job in a bigger company, that pays 9% more and has a better job title. There is NO turning back now and I'll be putting in my 2 weeks on Monday.

I'm not sure how much weight a reference from a 5 month stint holds, but I'd really like to maintain good ties with a lot of people from this company for that.

"sorry this ended up being so long and rambly. 

here's the tl;dr version: 

i've been depressed for a while but have just been 'getting on with it'. i changed jobs recently hoping the change might help but it did the opposite, i feel worse than ever. i want to leave my job asap, i need to give 4 weeks notice, i have 2 weeks leave to use and i've got a med cert for next week. what should i do? i don't care about burning bridges as i have other references i can use, i'll only use them if future employer want a reference from the most recent job.

i guess i've been depressed for a long time but i have just been dealing with it by not actually dealing with it and have been managing other than the occasional really low day. i changed job about six months ago hoping it might help give me some motivation/positivity. It's a complete change from what i did before and since the training at the beginning, then my first day on the floor, i had a feeling it wasn't going to be the job for me. It's a highly stressful job and i've felt like i'm barely hanging on since the very start. this on top of the depression got too much and i finally started seeing a counsellor. 

I have had no disciplinary issues and am actually performing well, but at great expense to my mental health. the work itself is fine but the workload and deadlines are overwhelming. i constantly feel stressed, i often work late (even though most other staff don't bother), i sleep poorly often waking up in the middle of the night panicked about work, i can't relax and enjoy my days off because i'm just anxious about going back. i have told my manager about feeling stressed/overwhelmed and they just said 'oh some stress is good, it's just about learning to manage it better and managing your workload/priorities better, come see me if you're feeling overwhelmed' which i have done however it's always only a temporary fix for that day as i'm still getting increased workloads anyway.

it's also an unpleasant environment to be in, my whole team is stressed, i haven't really made friends because everyone's so busy no one really talks to each other. we don't feel supported by our manager who is very stats driven. every time i've emailed them regarding anything not directly related to work/stats, it's ignored; such as letting them know about leaving early for medical appointments, giving plenty of heads up about leave i want to take, requesting an ergonomic assessment as i was experiencing physical discomfort..etc. i always have to follow up by physically going over to their desk later, then they're like oh i'm not ignoring you while desperately going through their inbox looking for my email to read what i wrote. while they've never been explicitly awful towards me, the passive aggressiveness is really draining.

anyway it all came to a head this week when i took a mental health day on monday (my first day off since i started), but actually got sick; went in the next day anyway because i was stressed about the work build up from the day off; worked late tues/wed to catch up; noticed more work put in my list on thurs and asked about it and they were like oh yes you're due for a workload increase i was just about to email you about it; in these 3 days i went in clearly still sick, never once did they suggest i should go home if i'm still not well; then i had an unrelated minor traffic incident thursday night and had to wait an hour and a half for assistance to come and didn't get home until 12.30.

so i took friday off too. when i went to the local clinic to get a medical cert, the GP was really attentive and seemed to genuinely care about my mental wellbeing. and everything just boiled over. she wrote me a medical cert for next week off too and said to go back and see her at the end of next week for a review and she'd be happy to write me another for the following week if i need. and when i emailed the med cert through to work, you guessed it, no acknowledgement!! 

i had already decided a little while ago i wanted to leave this job and relocate to another city where the rest of my family are, to be closer to them. but i was going to stick it out a bit longer. however after this week i just want to be finished with the job already and go be with them as soon as possible. i can't bear the thought of going back to this job, it gives me anxiety just thinking about it. 

my contract says i have to give 4 weeks notice. i have 2 weeks leave accumulated. i'm thinking of sending in my resignation next week while i'm still on sick leave, then i'll use my 2 weeks annual after that but that's only 3 weeks and i'm not sure what to do. or can i say 4 week's notice, 1st week's already covered by my med cert, i'll use my leave for weeks 3-4 and i'll just get another med cert for the 2nd week when i see the doctor next week?

i've always worked out my proper notice periods in the past as i've never been in this situation before. i'm not sure what to do and i'm stressing about it. i'm meant to be using this week to relax and rest and work on trying to feel better but instead i'm worried about this. 

how much do i tell them? do i say it's stress related or just say i'm relocating for family/personal reasons? i'm still in my probation period for a few weeks if that makes any difference?

please help, any advice will be much appreciated!

"Hi, I'm a fresh graduate who recently started a 2-year rotational program. I will be staying with my current department and team for 1 year, but 2 months has passed and I'm already having thoughts of getting transferred to another team because 1) Everyone in the team is too busy to mentor a new hire; and 2) I'm stuck in between the conflict of two coworkers who are mentoring me atm

Currently, our team has a lot of meetings, too many meetings IMO; everyday they have impromptu meetings called by the bosses from the main office outside my country; some of my teammates work OT to finish work they haven't done due to the meetings

As for how I am caught in between my mentors' conflict, I tried my best to discuss briefly what happened:

\- Aug to early Sep*:* Did HR onboarding activities for the 1st week, 2nd week was endorsed to my team; manager assigned Person A to be my buddy. Person A was really nice to me, if not, one of the nicest people to me, but the team have some troubles with him in terms of behavior (he's an expat) but he might just be having culture shocks. I didn't do much during this time since the equipment which I need to use for my project is down.

\- Mid Sep:  Equipment got repaired. Manager noticed that I was being idle so he told Person B to give me tasks (basically Person B became my pseudo-buddy for 2 weeks; also, Person B doesn't really like Person A). Person B is hands-on, but he isn't really a good mentor (like he accompanies me to the production line then proceeds to just chatting with the people there and not really teach me how stuff works; I had to ask people how to do stuff) 

\- End of Sep: the team had a meeting to formalize my project. Manager said that Person A would be my buddy and I would be heavily working alongside him in his project

\- Oct 1st week: Manager asked me about how Person A as a buddy and if he was giving me tasks for the week (and I replied that I'm fine with him as my buddy and that he has given me a few tasks). He mentioned that he might alter again my project since in his perspective Person A is not performing well (manager wanted Person A to prioritize his project and improve his performance).

\- This week: Manager told me that Person B would be my official buddy (not sure if starting next week); however, I should not tell Person A that he will not be my buddy anymore. Right now, I'm working on both Persons A &amp; B's respective activities and this puts me in a lot more stress since I'm doing double of my workload. I'm trying to reach out to my manager about this but then he's too busy with all of the meetings

Idk if things would still get better but I really feel like being part of my current team is stunting my growth and learning in this company and in my career, that's why I'm considering maybe a new set of team who is less busy than my current team would change my outlook on the company, (also casually looking for jobs online). How do I address my desire to transfer teams to HR? Or are there other ways of me to deal with this dilemma?

I wanted to ask for advice for managing anxiety in the workplace. When I am in my element (not anxious), I am diligent, intuitive, self-assured and productive - I'm a really good employee.

"I've got a pretty good full time job, but I have some free time and I have debt so I figured I could get a part time job to make some extra money. I figured it would be even easier to find one now, since it is coming up the holidays so seasonal jobs are all around. I've applied for several positions and I'm not even getting interviews, I'm just straight up getting emails saying that they aren't interested. What is going on?

"About 10 days ago I had an interview for a maintenance position. I said how I had some experiemce but really wanted to learn more and he suggested that if I were to be hired that I could even attend trade school after hours (m-f 7-3). I was told about benefits and the starting hourly pay and how the crew works daily. I was told I was the first to be interviewed and that they had 15 days to finish interviews.

"Hey everyone, bear with me as this is pretty long, but I could use some advice:

This is my first job out of college, and have been there for about 3 months. I work as an analyst.

Much of my work over the past 3 months has been learning how the company works and taking on more of the work and regular reports/projects my team has to do. I’ve either taken many things on fully or help a lot with others.

The past month, my boss has been dumping more and more things on me, and when month end comes around, its just too much too do. It still takes me a while to do many of the reports because I’m still learning how to do them. But it seems like my boss expects the impossible.

I spent the past week working my tail off the entire day every day to finish reports and projects due for month end this week. However, yesterday something came up that was due. My boss had told me it needed to be done two days before, and when I finished it yesterday, he said I should have done it a week ago. He claimed it was done too last minute and was poorly done. This was the first I heard about it.

He was pissed and went through this whole spiel about how it should’ve been done way in advance and planned for me to do it ahead of time next month and walked me through it like I was a baby. I was pretty pissed off, but got over it today.

Then, in a meeting this morning with my boss going over the main project I had been working on most of this week, he says “oh yeah how is [insert another project I didn’t know about] coming along?”. I had never been told it needed to be done or was due this friday. The lift for this new report was huge and couldn’t possibly have been done by me this week. 

I did as much as I could, but I had already planned to leave early for vacation this weekend, which he said was okay. I sent it in, and then before leaving for my trip asked him if I needed to do anything else. He says “[report that was supposed to be done today] needs a lot of work, but we’ll just have to do it”. And then passive aggressively told me to have a good weekend.

The other entry level grads who work in other departments are never this busy. They get some work here and there, and usually go home early most days. Meanwhile I am drowning in work and my boss hates me for not finishing everything.

At this point I’m debating just looking for a new job, especially if I get in trouble for this. Should I stick this out or start updating my resume?","My first job is brutal, considering leaving",0
"Target kept moving my orientation date (they did so 6 times since late August, had to drive there each time for nothing) so recently, i simply didn’t show up the last time because 1. I expected them to do nothing again and 2. I wasn’t going to work for a store that wasted so much of my time like this.

Will future employers know about this, or will I be forced to explain? Because technically I haven’t worked there but I also signed some stuff.",Will my termination from a job I didn’t work for matter?,0
" I've been job searching for a few months so I was ecstatic when I actually received a call back today for a job interview. After accepting, I received an email confirming the details for the interview as well as a notice to bring 3 supervisory references and any necessary certificates.

I have no prior work experience and the couple volunteer references I have are several years old. I haven't kept up with any individuals from my time as a volunteer or professors from school (I'm a graduate).

Is this a classic case of the ""You dun mess up your networking boy,"" but see if I can salvage the interview? Or a ""you need to sit this one out"" type of situation?

Your comments/questions/critiques and advice are welcomed.",Received an interview offer for an entry level job only to later find out I need to bring 3 Supervisory References to the interview. I have no Supervisory References. Am I screwed?,0
